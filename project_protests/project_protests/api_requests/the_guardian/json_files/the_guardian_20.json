Floyd told the officers he could not breathe 12 times, including within the first few seconds of the video.&nbsp;Floyd said: \u201cI\u2019m about to die \u2026 they\u2019re gonna kill me,\u201d and called out for his mother.&nbsp;He lost consciousness, stopped breathing and his body went limp after four minutes.

     "body": "<p>John Lewis, the civil rights leader who was bloodied in protests against southern segregation, who spoke at the March on Washington and went on to become the \u201cconscience of Congress\u201d, has left a powerful call to action to the American people that is being heard on the day of his funeral.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/26/john-lewis-edmund-pettus-bridge-selma-alabama\">John Lewis crosses Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma for final time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lewis, who will be mourned, revered and celebrated on Thursday at Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta, sent his final rousing clarion call for peace and progress to the opinion editor of the New York Times two days before he died from pancreatic cancer on 17 July aged 80. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/opinion/john-lewis-op-ed.html\">He requested</a> that it be published on the day of his funeral.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/opinion/john-lewis-civil-rights-america.html\">The essay</a> rehearses several of the key moments that for Lewis shaped his life in non-violent protest and what he called \u201cgood trouble\u201d. He said he was inspired into the movement against America\u2019s brutal history of race discrimination by the lynching in Mississippi of Emmett Till, aged 15, in 1955 \u2013 when Lewis was himself just 14.</p> <p>\u201cEmmett Till was my George Floyd. He was my Rayshard Brooks, Sandra Bland and Breonna Taylor,\u201d he writes.</p> <p>He recalls how in his childhood in Alabama, the white supremacist threat was a fact of everyday life. \u201cUnchecked, unrestrained violence and government-sanctioned terror had the power to turn a simple stroll to the store for some Skittles or an innocent morning jog down a lonesome country road into a nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>Lewis goes on to recall the seminal moment that changed his life \u2013 hearing Martin Luther King Jr on the radio. \u201cHe was talking about the philosophy and discipline of nonviolence. He said we are all complicit when we tolerate injustice \u2026 He said each of us has a moral obligation to stand up, speak up and speak out.\u201d</p> <p>That connection with King will be made explicit for a second time on Thursday at his funeral at Ebenezer where King was a former pastor. The elder civil rights leader continued to inspire Lewis for the next 65 years as he fought segregation during sometimes bloody marches, Greyhound bus \u201cFreedom Rides\u201c across the south and later during his long tenure in the US Congress.</p> <p>Former US president Barack Obama will be attending the funeral and is expected to address mourners, according to a person familiar with the arrangements who was not authorized to speak publicly. President George W Bush\u2019s office said the former president and first lady Laura Bush also will attend.</p> <p>Fellow former president Jimmy Carter will not attend as he has indicated he is no longer travelling, but has sent his condolences in his absence.</p> <p>Ebenezer\u2019s senior pastor, the Rev Raphael Warnock, who will officiate at the funeral, said of Lewis in an interview late on Wednesday: \u201cHe was my hero. He laid it all on the line, at the risk of life and limb.\u201c</p> <p>He added: \u201cHe read the Gospel, and he actually believed it \u2013 love your enemies.\u201d</p> <p>When Lewis was 15, he heard King\u2019s sermons on WRMA, a radio station in Montgomery, in Lewis\u2019s native Alabama, he recalled in an interview for the Southern Oral History Program.</p> <p>\u201cLater I saw him on many occasions in Nashville while I was in school between 1958 and \u201961,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIn a sense, he was my leader.\u201d King was \u201cthe person who, more than any other, continued to influence my life, who made me who I was,\u201c Lewis wrote in his 1998 autobiography, Walking with the Wind.</p> <p>By the summer of 1963, Lewis was addressing thousands of people during the March on Washington, as the youngest speaker at the pivotal historic event and speaking shortly before King gave his I Have a Dream speech. He spoke then about Black people beaten by police and jailed \u2013 themes that resonate vividly in today\u2019s times.</p> <p>\u201cMy friends, let us not forget that we are involved in a serious social revolution,\u201c Lewis told the enormous crowd stretching into the distance from the Lincoln Memorial on the Washington National Mall.</p> <p>\u201cTo those who have said, \u2018Be patient and wait,\u2019 we have long said that we cannot be patient,\u201d he added. \u201cWe do not want our freedom gradually, but we want to be free now. We are tired. We are tired of being beaten by policemen. We are tired of seeing our people locked up in jail over and over again.\u201d</p> <p>In 1965, Lewis was beaten and his skull broken by Alabama state troopers in the city of Selma as he was in the vanguard of civil rights protesters crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in what became known as Bloody Sunday.</p> <p>Last Sunday, his casket was carried across that bridge. The horse-drawn wagon rolled over a carpet of rose petals on the bridge that spans the Alabama River.</p> <p>On the south side of the bridge, where Lewis was attacked by the law officers, family members placed red roses, marking the spot where Lewis spilled his blood, along with others.</p> <p>His casket was taken to Washington to lie in state in the Capitol rotunda, and then flown to Georgia on Wednesday.</p> <p>He spent more than three decades in Congress, and his district included most of Atlanta.</p> <p>Lewis was a member of Ebenezer, and \u201cit was my honor to serve as pastor to John Lewis, a man of faith and a true American patriot who selflessly risked life and limb in the sacred cause of truth-telling and justice-making in the world,\u201d Warnock said in a statement before the funeral.</p> <p>\u201cHe was wounded for America\u2019s transgressions, crushed for our iniquities and by his bruises we are healed,\u201d Warnock added. \u201cToday we weep. Tomorrow we continue the work of healing that was his life\u2019s work.\u201d</p> <p>After the funeral, Lewis will be buried at the South-View cemetery outside Atlanta, where King was initially laid to rest before his body was moved to the Martin Luther King Center. <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/what-to-know-about-the-place-where-john-lewis-will-be-buried/B5PFWUGC25C55I4EH7SKXO27BE/\">South-View cemetery</a> was founded in 1886 as a final resting place for formerly enslaved black people.</p>"

After BTS donated $1m to Black Lives Matter, a fan collective charity known as One in An ARMY after the name adopted by the group\u2019s followers matched the sum.</p> \n<p>BTS and other groups have also donated to other social and humanitarian causes, including Syrian refugees and campaigns to end violence against children.</p> \n<p>\u201cSeveral K-pop stars have significantly influenced the thinking and behaviour of young music fans by conveying meaningful messages in lyrics about issues such as social injustice, the social divide and corruption,\u201d said Jin Dal-yong, a professor at the school of communication at Simon Fraser University in Canada.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f892053c-5eb6-4246-ac72-2fa08048887a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uIOWkMTHJqU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There appears to be less enthusiasm, however, for global activism among fans in the country of K-pop\u2019s birth, where admiration for the artists\u2019 altruism comes with a reluctance to interfere in politics. Some fan sites have banned discussions on the subject.</p> \n<p>The campaign to support Black Lives Matter was widely welcomed, particularly after BTS\u2019s donation, but some South Korean fans said they were uncomfortable about taking on the role of Trump\u2019s online nemesis.</p> \n<p>\u201cBLM was understandable as it was about human rights, but it makes me uncomfortable to see my idols pop up in Trump-related news,\u201d one wrote on Weverse, BTS\u2019s official fan community app.</p> \n<p>K-pop fans and other online activists who coalesce around single issues could become a significant new force, according to Song. In recent days, copycat campaigns have appeared, including one that involved Twitter users transforming a #<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23JapaneseLivesMatter&amp;src=typed_query\">JapaneseLivesMatter</a> hashtag into a photographic tribute to Japanese cuisine.</p> \n<p>\u201cK-pop fan raids on social media platforms is something we will see more of in the future,\u201d Song said. \u201cYoung people are taking out their anger and frustration through a peaceful online social movement. They feel empowered, and their message resonates online across different generations, locations, nationalities and ethnic backgrounds.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Agencies contributed reporting to this article</em></p>"

As a function of the same exact structural forces that have allowed black people to be executed by law enforcement.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>There\u2019s a lot of righteous anger out there and a lot of it is from being ignored, not taken seriously and the allowing of these types of things to continue</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Mandela Barnes</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The intense national focus on Floyd\u2019s death and the responses by top political figures comes about a week after Biden\u2019s campaign had to do damage control after the former vice-president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/joe-biden-draws-criticism-americans-who-back-trump-aint-black\">suggested during an interview</a> that anyone who supported Trump isn\u2019t really black.</p> \n<p>At the time, it seemed like Biden was at risk of losing some African American support. But since then that narrative has shifted dramatically. Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking black Democratic member of Congress, said Friday that the riots damaged the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar\u2019s chances of being picked as Biden\u2019s running mate due to her record as a prosecutor in the city.</p> \n<p>Clyburn has argued that Biden should pick an African American woman, which would certainly draw a sharp contrast with Trump.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think right now what you\u2019re seeing is black voters get to see how Donald Trump reacts to things like this. It\u2019s a reminder of his history, his history of calling on law enforcement to be more aggressive, to be more brutal in their enforcement of the law,\u201d said the Democratic strategist Brandon Davis. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Davis added: \u201cI think in the next several months this is going to continue to be front and center in the conversation. I think over that time period people are going to see how Joe Biden deals with these issues, how he reacts to these issues, and I think they\u2019ll get to see, again, where Donald Trump is.\u201d</p> \n<p>This is hardly the first time the country has had to grapple with the dynamics around an African American dying at the hands of the police, but Daughtry suggested that this may be its own unique flashpoint.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis feels different,\u201d Daughtry said. \u201cIt could be because the world is smaller and information travels more quickly. But I wonder if it\u2019s not the intersection of a president whose rhetoric and demeanor and actions have unleashed a part of America that\u2019s been hidden, underground and in the closet for decades.\u201d</p>"

How they handle the pandemic may well be crucial at the presidential election this November too, writes my colleague David Smith.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Just as in the 2016, the swing states bring national trends into sharp focus. Democratic governors across the country have generally urged caution, particularly in major cities, citing concerns for public health from a virus that has killed more than 85,000 people in the US \u2013 more than any other country in the world.</p> \n   <p>But Republican governors have tended to err on the side of reopening faster, alarmed that more than 36m Americans have submitted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/us-unemployment-and-employment-statistics\">unemployment</a> claims since mid-March and retail sales dipped 16.4% last month. Southern states such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgi\">Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas\">Texas</a> were among the first to allow shops and businesses to reopen.</p> \n   <p>\u201cVaccine or no vaccine, we\u2019re back,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/trump-coronavirus-warp-speed-vaccine-white-house\">Trump said in the White House rose garden</a> on Friday while announcing a major <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/the-race-for-a-vaccine-how-trumps-america-first-approach-slows-the-global-search\">US drive to create a coronavirus vaccine</a>.</p> \n   <p>Polls show Biden beating Trump in battleground states but <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/people/faculty-fellows/schiller\">Wendy Schiller,</a> a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, warns that he still faces political traps.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThe fundamental problem for the Democratic party is that in order to defeat Trump, they almost have to cheerlead for a bad economy and they also have to cheerlead for new [coronavirus] hotspots in swing states.

A large nursing home population, accounting for about half the county\u2019s deaths, and densely housed poor people are two main reasons.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38cc411c3adeba2253eebe13d8d8a305b4c6ba50\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38cc411c3adeba2253eebe13d8d8a305b4c6ba50/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coronavirus testing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A view of a coronavirus drive-through testing site in Los Angeles.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chelsea Lauren/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec014a98f0886ce4f5d4d95\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-16T16:30:21.662Z\">5.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The Trump machine continues to hammer away at presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.</strong> Only days after launching a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/trump-2020-campaign-strategy-attack-biden\">barrage of negative digital ads</a> questioning the former vice-president\u2019s mental acuity, Donald Trump Jr came in hot on Saturday morning with an Instagram post suggesting Biden is a pedophile.<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAP6ERslm-v/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

That includes some rural districts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\">New York</a> state even though the world\u2019s hotspot for <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a></strong> - the Big Apple - is still under max restrictions. This comes while states are under intense pressure from <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a></strong> to reopen, but after a week of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/12/coronavirus-us-live-fauci-testify-danger-reopening-early-trump-tweets-cuomo-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ebab9608f08d99d46a15836#block-5ebab9608f08d99d46a15836\">warnings</a> from America\u2019s top public health experts that rushing to lift stay-at-home orders without a sustained decline in new cases risks \u201cserious consequences\u201d. And an Associated Press analysis found that 41 of the nation\u2019s 50 states fall short of the <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/what-is-covid-19\">Covid-19</a></strong> testing levels that experts say are necessary to avoid another wave of outbreaks.</li> \n   <li>Donald Trump is at the presidential retreat Camp David, where he is up and very, very busy tweeting and retweeting. Perhaps the most arresting one so far is a retweet of an article that says: \u201cThe fact is that we already have more compelling evidence that the Obama administration engaged in misconduct than we ever did for opening the Russian-collusion investigation.\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1261606781979168771\">tweeted</a>: \u201cSo true!\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/16/trump-obama-obsession-coronavirus-president\"><strong>Here</strong></a>\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidsmith\">David Smith</a> this morning on 45\u2019s obsession with 44 as the election looms... </li> \n   <li>Talking of <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a></strong>, the former president <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/1257687918388424707\">will give</a> a virtual <strong>commencement address</strong> this afternoon at 2pm ET for students graduating from America\u2019s Historically Black Universities and Colleges (<strong>HBCU</strong>). Then at 8pm ET he joins some other luminaries to give another virtual commencement address for the US\u2019s <strong>high schoolers</strong> who are graduating. It\u2019s some consolation for the students who aren\u2019t able to gather in person for the usual celebratory ceremonies.</li> \n   <li>And the fall-out will continue from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration\">Trump administration</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/16/steve-linick-state-department-official-investigating-pompeo-is-fired\">firing overnight</a> of the <strong>state department watchdog Steve Linick.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div>"

     "body": "<p>Nine in 10 Americans believe that racism and police violence are problems in the country, a Guardian/<a href=\"https://www.opinium.com/\">Opinium Research</a> poll has found, a sign that public opinion is shifting away from the views put forward by Donald Trump.</p> <p>The US president has been criticised for relentlessly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/us/politics/trump-bubba-wallace-nascar.html\">stoking white fear</a> and grievance in recent weeks, putting him at odds with Black Lives Matter anti-racism protests that have swept the nation following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May.</p> <p>But the Opinium survey of 2,000 US adults, conducted for the Guardian between 19 and 24 June, suggests that Trump is out of sync with the mood across the political spectrum.</p> <p>Some 91% of Americans now agree that racism is a problem in the US and 72% deem it is a serious one. Similarly, 89% think police violence is a problem and 65% consider it serious.</p> <p>This opinion also cuts across age groups. Although younger Americans are predictably more likely to view racism as a serious problem \u2013 four in five (80%) \u2013 the view is shared by nearly seven in 10 (68%) of 35- to 54-year-olds and even more (69%) and those over 55 \u2013 a demographic group often associated with Trump\u2019s base.</p> <p>The president has responded to the demonstrations with animus. Last month security forces used teargas to break up a peaceful protest at Lafayette Square outside the White House so Trump could stage a photo op outside a historic church. He has defended \u201claw and order\u201d, historic statues and, critics say, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/07/trump-civil-war-culture-war-election-biden\">a legacy of white domination,</a> while fiercely denouncing \u201cthe radical left, the Marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters\u201d.</p> <p>Opinium\u2019s research found that more Americans disapprove than approve of Trump\u2019s response to the protests (47% v 31%). This is true, predictably, of registered Democrats (75% v 12%) but also of registered independents (55% v 27%). Seven in 10 (70%) of those who voted for Trump in 2016 back his actions: 70% approve while 14% disapprove.</p> <p>The Black Lives Matter protests peaked on 6 June with half a million people protesting in nearly 550 places across America, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html\">the New York Times reported this week</a>, and may be the biggest movement in the nation\u2019s history. They have prompted change everywhere from corporate boardrooms to country music to food brands to sports teams. About 60 Confederate statues have been removed or are set to be, while Mississippi voted to remove a Confederate emblem from its state flag.</p> <p>There has been much debate over whether this will prove a moment or a movement with more lasting impact than protests of the past. The Opinium survey offers a snapshot. The demographic of 18-to-34-year-olds are most optimistic that Black Lives Matter will lead to real change: 56% believe it will, as opposed to 44% of the general population.</p> <p>Young Americans are significantly more engaged in the movement: 73% of 18-to-34-year-olds have taken some sort of action in support of it compared with 52% of the general population. Almost one in five (18%) have signed a petition in support of the movement versus one in 10 (10%) of all Americans.</p> <p>About 9% have gone out to protest themselves, versus 4% of all Americans. And 12% of 18-to-34-year-olds were inspired by the movement to check their voter registration versus only 6% of the general population. Nearly five times as many Americans posted on social media to support Black Lives Matter than contacted their government representatives asking for change: 14% as opposed to 3%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59eecdfeb8d9278cacff2a9fc1b9288eb526ce4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59eecdfeb8d9278cacff2a9fc1b9288eb526ce4b/0_1_4338_2602/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A line of police officers in riot gear move forward to form a security perimeter on 16th St NW near Black Lives Matter Plaza and Lafayette Square near the White House in Washington on 23 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police officers in riot gear move forward to form a security perimeter on 16th St NW near the White House in Washington on 23 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump has launched full-throated defences of the police, about which the survey found contrasting views. Three in four people (76%) believe that most cops are good people but there are a few \u201cbad apples\u201d. More than one in 10 (13%) take the opposite view \u2013 that most police officers are bad people, but there are some good ones. The former view holds for black/African American respondents, though by a smaller margin (49% to 32%).</p> <p>With police reform currently <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/25/883263263/house-approves-police-reform-bill-but-issue-stalled-amid-partisan-standoff\">stalled in Congress</a>, Opinium found the most widely supported measures are: investigating all use of deadly force by police (74% approve), ban police use of chokeholds and other neck restraints (67%), make police misconduct records publicly available (66%), require officers to use de-escalation when they can (66%), require officers to use alternatives to deadly force when possible (59%).</p> <p>Some activists have called for police to be \u201cdefunded\u201d, though the exact meaning of that term <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">has been contested</a>, and has also been exploited by Trump to sow fear that Democrats and their allies would allow violent crime to flourish.</p> <p>According to the poll, only one in four (24%) of Americans say they agree with \u201cdefund the police\u201d and more than half (58%) disagree. One in three (32%) say they approve of redirecting funding for police departments towards education/healthcare and community social programmes.</p> <p>Commentators have drawn comparisons with the unrest of 1968. Americans are divided on whether past civil rights leaders would be proud of this current movement and the recent protests. About 39% think Martin Luther King would not be proud, while 36% believe he would be. Americans are more confident that Malcolm X would be proud of this movement: 39% say he would while 20% say not.</p> <p>The survey was conducted online and weighted to represent the US adult population according to demographics, education and past voting behaviour.</p> <p>Among those who say they are registered to vote and certain to do so in November\u2019s election, former vice-president Joe Biden leads Trump by 52% to 40% \u2013 a double-digit lead reflected by <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html\">several other national polls</a>. More than half (52%) of Americans disapprove of the job Trump is doing as president, while little more than a third (36%) approve.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Delroy Lindo has waited 25 years to work with Spike Lee again and Da 5 Bloods gives him one of the best roles of his career. But when he first read the script, the actor had a few questions about his character. Chiefly: \u201cDoes he have to be a Trump supporter?\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>He says: \u201cI remember saying to Spike, \u2018I\u2019ve got a 17-year-old son, man. I don\u2019t want him seeing me representing this person.\u2019\u201d Like Lee, who routinely refers to Donald Trump as Agent Orange, Lindo can barely bring himself to identify the president by name. \u201cIt had to do with my values, as a parent and as a being on the planet, feeling that I would be representing an individual who is ... I don\u2019t have the words to discuss this individual.\u201d Couldn\u2019t the character, he pleaded, just be an arch-conservative? \u201cSpike thought about it for a few days, then said, \u2018Yeah, I really need him to be a Trump supporter.\u2019\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>All the same, the role was just too good to pass up. Lindo plays Paul, one of four African American Vietnam veterans returning, in the modern day, to the country where they fought. Their stated aim is to recover the remains of their fallen comrade, played in flashbacks by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/15/black-panther-chadwick-boseman-interview-everybodys-minds-are-opening-up\">Chadwick Boseman</a>, but they have an ulterior motive, another plan that makes their mission much less laudable. As with Lee\u2019s previous film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/26/blackkklansman-review-spike-lee-blistering-return-to-form\">BlacKkKlansman</a>, Da 5 Bloods is a combustible mix of tones and genres that only he could pull off, combining black history, crime thriller, war movie, character drama, even gory comedy. \u201cFundamentally,\u201d says Lindo, \u201cit\u2019s a love story between these men.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5RDTPfsLAI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D5RDTPfsLAI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5RDTPfsLAI\">Watch a trailer for Da 5 Bloods</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Lee\u2019s work is always relevant when it comes to African American issues, but arriving at this moment \u2013 with the US rocked by protests and riots over the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> \u2013 Da 5 Bloods resonates in ways even he could not have anticipated. The film highlights the disproportionate nature of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/22/spike-lee-vietnam-da-5-bloods-black-veterans\">African American sacrifice in Vietnam</a>: black people, it claims, made up 11% of the US population but 32% of troops.</p> <p>But it also feeds into issues of black patriotism, inequality and justice. In one flashback, in the Vietnamese jungle, the five comrades learn of the death of Dr Martin Luther King via Hanoi Hannah, the Vietcong propaganda radio broadcaster. She informs them of the widespread rioting back home, and the brutal government response. \u201cWhy you fight against us so far away from where you are needed?\u201d she asks. Lee overlays her speech with archive clips of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/19/the-whole-world-is-watching-chicago-police-riot-vietnam-war-regan\">1968 riots</a>. It looks a lot like this week\u2019s news footage.</p> <p>Lindo agrees. He recently attended a rally and has been meeting with young people and sympathetic law enforcement in Oakland, where he lives, on the east side of San Francisco Bay. The rally was peaceful and diverse, he says, which at least gives him some hope that things have progressed since 1968. \u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">events of the last few days</a> are brilliant examples of taking the hurt, fear, anxiety and rage \u2013 and focusing those things constructively, creatively and humanely, although I am not naive enough to think that things will change, even in the next six months. But I want to believe that the seeds have been planted.\u201d</p> <p>Lindo, now 67, has a calm, authoritative bearing that tends to make everyone quieten down and listen. Over his 45-year career, he has had mostly smaller roles in big movies (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/26/pitch-perfect-get-shorty-at-30-elmore-leonard-dennis-lehane\">Get Shorty</a>, The Cider House Rules, Gone in 60 Seconds, Ransom) and bigger roles in smaller movies (baseball hero Satchel Paige in Soul of the Game, explorer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/24/matthew-henson-arctic-explorer-first-man-to-north-pole\">Matthew Henson</a> in Glory &amp; Honour). But whatever it is that defines actorly \u201cpresence\u201d, Lindo has got it. In real life, he is not so different - at least not in the context of a Zoom conversation from his home. He is serious and thoughtful, choosing his words carefully. Most of the lighter-hearted questions I had prepared go unasked.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cce5da6af3d15eb674194c70a450fcb4540db736\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cce5da6af3d15eb674194c70a450fcb4540db736/0_0_2000_1355/1000.jpg\" alt=\"High point \u2026as gangster West Indian Archie in Malcolm X, with Denzel Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Perfect Jamaican accent \u2026 as gangster West Indian Archie in Malcolm X, with Denzel Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>High points on Lindo\u2019s CV undoubtedly include the three films he made with Lee in the 90s: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/19/malcolm-x-spike-lee-biopic-black-cinema-selma-the-butler\">Malcolm X</a> (in which he played the activist\u2019s criminal mentor), Crooklyn (a struggling father), and Clockers (drug boss). Which poses the question: why did it take so long for them to work together again? \u201cAsk Spike, god doggit!\u201d Lindo says. \u201cWe\u2019ve bumped into each other over the years, and I always say, \u2018Spike, we really need to do something.\u2019 And he says, \u2018Yeah, yeah. We need to do something.\u2019 But if I had to wait 25 years to work with Spike, this is a good one to have waited for.\u201d</p> <p>Lindo plays the most complex and conflicted character of the piece. While his comrades, and Vietnam itself, have moved on from the war, Paul is still living with the trauma and anger, his red MAGA cap a symbol of his bitterness. He gets a striking straight-to-camera monologue towards the end that you can already see fitting into montages at awards ceremonies.</p> <p>Politics aside, Lindo had a great time making the film. Shooting in Thailand and Vietnam was a proper adventure: battle scenes, river journeys (cue Apocalypse Now reference), snakes, landmines, and literally hacking through the jungle with a machete. \u201cOh man. That\u2019s gold for an actor! Getting that machete and \u2013 swish! It\u2019s drama, it\u2019s what we went to acting school for, absolutely.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a82ccc6d8e384ae180dcac0ce010fbcab32c2545\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a82ccc6d8e384ae180dcac0ce010fbcab32c2545/0_0_3086_2008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"London pride \u2026 in 2003 cricket movie Wondrous Oblivion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"651\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">London pride \u2026 as a father in 2003 cricket movie Wondrous Oblivion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Momentum Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lindo doesn\u2019t know any actual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/12/black-republicans-african-american-voters\">black Trump supporters</a>, but he did manage to get his head around the concept. \u201cI have a cousin who was in \u2019Nam and it still rankles him that he was reviled as a \u2018baby-killer\u2019. So if one extrapolates that kind of rejection, one can end up at a place where you say, \u2018OK, here\u2019s a man, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a>, who\u2019s saying I\u2019m going to make things right for Americans. I like what he\u2019s saying.\u2019\u201d Lee, for his part, has justified the character on the grounds of both dramatic interest and political diversity. \u201cAll black people do not think alike,\u201d he said recently. \u201cWe\u2019re not one monolithic group.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Lindo\u2019s own identity is not straightforward. He was actually born in Lewisham, London, to parents of Jamaican origin (his ability to do a perfect accent helped land him the role of West Indian Archie in Malcolm X). He spent the first 12 years of his life in the UK before his mother, a nurse, emigrated to Canada then to San Francisco, where he studied acting. He still has an affection for Britain and returns often. In 2003\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,1202552,00.html\">Wondrous Oblivion</a>, he played a cricket-loving Jamaican father in 1960s London.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything in my life is as a result of leaving England. I could never in a trillion years have had this career there</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He asks about the gentrification of Peckham, worrying it will go the same way as Brixton. But he does not really feel British any longer. \u201cEverything I have achieved in my life has come as a result of leaving England. I could never in a trillion years have had this career in England. Never.\u201d</p> <p>But he would love to work in the UK again. \u201cThere are many components of the black British experience that have not been explored. Is that an accurate thing for me to say?\u201d He\u2019s choosing his words carefully again. \u201cI\u2019m curious to unpack those stories. I have an intense interest in the Windrush period, because my mom was part of that.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, he is familiar with the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a>, in which black British citizens were wrongfully detained and deported to Jamaica by the UK Home Office. \u201cIt felt very, very British,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was disgusting and enraging. For me, it went right to&nbsp;the centre of the British relationship with people of colour and the historical violations that have been visited on them. They manifest slightly differently but British racism is every bit as virulent and violent as American racism. Even with second and third generation black people who were born British citizens, there is still this element of, \u2018You don\u2019t belong here\u2019 and \u2018You are an immigrant.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Even given what\u2019s happening right now in the US? He cites the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence in 1993. \u201cWhen I heard it had happened in Eltham \u2013 where I lived as a child \u2013 it did not surprise me, given incidents that happened to me there.\u201d He also remembers working with playwright <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/kwame-kwei-armah\">Kwame Kwei-Armah</a> in London the early 2000s. Kwei-Armah drove Lindo back to his hotel one evening. \u201cWe were parked outside, talking, and all of a sudden cops descended on us: 20 or 30 cops.

     "standfirst": "<p>After Killer Mike\u2019s impassioned speech about the death of George Floyd went viral, he and his partner El-P explain why a mix of serious politics and surreal goofiness makes their music perfect for our times</p>",
     "body": "<p>Run the Jewels have enjoyed one of the more improbable rises to fame in recent hip-hop history. Two figures nearing 40, from the genre\u2019s margins \u2013 Killer Mike on the fringes of Outkast\u2019s Atlanta-based circle of rappers and producers, his partner El-P a founder member of Company Flow and longstanding critical darling of east coast underground rap \u2013 who pooled their resources to record a mixtape. They gave it away and watched, astonished, as it and its two successors became runaway successes.</p> \n<p>It happened despite the fact that their music \u2013 political, angry, more about lyrics than hooks \u2013 is grounded in the golden age hip-hop of Public Enemy and EPMD, and swims against the genre\u2019s prevalent trends. Yet for all they profess a certain mystification over Run the Jewels\u2019 success, it\u2019s hard to avoid the feeling that they\u2019re the right band for the moment: an alternately surreal and furious response to a world spinning bizarrely, horribly out of control.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1b0a8c5c-44b0-420c-914e-ff68aaace720\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FKc1o5mJVnQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The key moment in their history may have been the night in 2014 they played St Louis hours after the announcement that the police officer Darren Wilson would not face charges after shooting an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. Every other gig in the city was cancelled, but Run the Jewels performed. Mike addressed the audience beforehand, his voice breaking with emotion as he talked about his fears for his children.</p> \n<p>Footage of his speech went viral.<strong> </strong>Now, another of his speeches, made in horrifyingly similar circumstances, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/30/killer-mike-you-have-a-duty-not-to-burn-your-own-house-down-video\">has gone viral again</a>.<strong> </strong>I speak to the pair two days after George Floyd, an unarmed black man, died after a white police officer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-death-minneapolis-police-chief-medaria-arradondo-officers-complicit\">Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for nine minutes as he complained he could not breathe</a>. Rioting had yet to spread from Minneapolis across the US, but the lyrics of Walking in the Snow \u2013 a track from their forthcoming album, RTJ4, that references the 2014 death of Eric Garner \u2013 have already taken on a terrible new currency: \u201cAnd you so numb you watch the cops choke out a man like me / Till my voice goes from a shriek to whisper, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019 / And you sit there in the house on the couch and watch it on TV / The most you give\u2019s a Twitter rant and call it a tragedy.\u201d</p> \n<p>After our meeting, Mike\u2019s op-ed for the daily news website Colorlines is published, under his real name, Mike Render,&nbsp;encouraging \u201cpeople who look like me\u201d to \u201ctake seriously their second amendment rights \u2026 The only person you can count on to protect yourself and your family is you \u2026 I encourage gun ownership to my wife, my son and daughters, your sons and daughters and all black people.\u201d</p> \n<p>Then, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/atlanta-police-chief-erika-shields-george-floyd-protest\">rioting spreads to Atlanta</a>, he appears at a press conference with the city\u2019s mayor, fighting back tears as he gives an extraordinary, eloquent speech. \u201cIt is your duty not to burn your own house down for anger with the enemy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is your duty to fortify your own house so that you may be a house of refuge in times of organisation. Now is the time to plot, plan, strategise, organise and mobilise \u2026 we don\u2019t want to see Targets burning, we want to see the system that sets up for systemic racism burnt to the ground.\u201d The speech struck such a chord that there are calls for Mike to run for office: \u201cKiller Mike is a leader I hope to vote for one day,\u201d offers the comedian Sarah Silverman.</p> \n<p>All that is to come, but the sentiment is mirrored in our interview. On rioting, he says: \u201cIt feels like nobody gives a shit when you\u2019re black. That\u2019s why you burn down your own community, not because you want to burn down your own community, but because you feel like nobody gives a shit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5990bf87e1bc7cb0e51aad417d8ff143847714ea\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5990bf87e1bc7cb0e51aad417d8ff143847714ea/0_0_2604_1563/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Killer Mike and El-P on stage in London in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Killer Mike and El-P on stage in London in 2018.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katja Ogrin/WireImage</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cYou know, I used to wonder: why did rock\u2019n\u2019roll guys tear up their hotel room? Well, you\u2019ve never had the exhilaration of entertaining thousands of people, then going back to your room alone, away from your wife and children and family \u2013 coupled with drugs and anxiety; you might tear up a room. Now that we\u2019ve had to sit in our houses for 60 days, I think people can kind of understand that. Doesn\u2019t make it right. Doesn\u2019t make rioting right.\u201d</p> \n<p>The media reporting on protests doesn\u2019t help this feeling that the killing of black people doesn\u2019t trouble the majority, he says. \u201cIt really does feel like nobody gives a shit, even when they do, because the media is \u2026 not going to tell you that there were white people on the ground and black people on the ground, different races and sexes. </p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to preach separation, they\u2019re going to preach fear, conservatism v liberalism \u2013 they\u2019re going to keep stoking those fires. So, we have some action to do now. Giving a shit is the first phase: now let\u2019s progress it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, El-P, real name Jaime Meline, is optimistic that this could be time of real change \u2013 and that the status quo may be tilting. \u201cI want the oppressors, the enemy, to know that they haven\u2019t created complete hopelessness yet,\u201d he says. \u201cI want motherfuckers to know that there are people from every cultural line that are ultimately not going to accept this.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t want them to think they are off the hook. I look at these riots and I see white people, black people, Asians, women and men \u2013 and I know this shit is coming to a head. It\u2019s getting to the point where your whole system of racism does not apply any more to the spiritual and mental mindset of the new generation.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have outgrown you, despite your best efforts to keep us in the same place. You are in power, but you are outmoded. You\u2019re the old form of human. And the new form is coming for your neck.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking over Zoom \u2013 Mike at home in Atlanta, El-P in New York \u2013 the pair say the way the coronavirus pandemic has been handled in the US is shocking, if not surprising. El-P offers up a customarily colourful analogy to explain the way it has been politicised and used to stoke division. \u201cI\u2019ve had this conversation with Mike a bunch of times. Mike has said to me: \u2018I just want aliens to advance so we can all bond together,\u2019 and I\u2019m here to tell you, Mike, that\u2019s not going to happen! The aliens have invaded, and guess what? We didn\u2019t come together!</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievably depressing. I\u2019ve never thought in my life that I&nbsp;would see someone politicise a virus. But I should have known, because I saw Aids ravage the gay community and my friends, my parents, lost dozens and dozens of good friends. The same lineage of politician was in office and they completely ignored the people they considered to be the fringes of society.\u201d</p> \n<p> In 2018, Run the Jewels had elected to take a sabbatical after, as Mike puts it, \u201ceight years on the road\u201d. The pair were \u201cexhausted, not only as performers, but a little bit as friends, too,\u201d says El-P, a striking admission given their celebrated bromance. Interviewing them over Zoom, you notice how the pair finish each other\u2019s sentences, and frequently seem to be addressing each other as much as me. \u201cWell, whatever minuscule issues that might have been there are magnified,\u201d El-P nods, \u201cbecause you\u2019re living together on a bus for a year and a half, so you end up wanting to strangle your friend. You wake up and think: \u2018How can I kill you and get away with it? How can I kill you, but still be in the group?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b699f49e978ae6dac7b6b2ccfc366f4b5d25a370\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b699f49e978ae6dac7b6b2ccfc366f4b5d25a370/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mike campaigning with Bernie Sanders.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike (left) campaigning with Bernie Sanders.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Lott/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mike became a political pundit, activist, TV star and a loud advocate for the presidential candidacy of Bernie Sanders (who was photographed making Run the Jewels\u2019 signature hand gesture \u2013 one hand cocked in imitation of a pistol, the other clenched in a fist).</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat I learned from [campaigning with Sanders] is that it\u2019s all about money,\u201d he sighs. \u201cMoney has totally rotted and corrupted our system, and, more than that, we\u2019ve grown so apathetic that we are not beating their heads on a local level to change that. I\u2019m hoping that, within my lifetime, we\u2019ll see a change in that.\u201d</p> \n<p>He also pursued a TV career. His hilarious and thought-provoking Netflix show, Trigger Warning, saw him attempting to get members of the Crips and Bloods gangs to market their own brand of soda and to start a new religion based around worshipping a friend of his, nicknamed Sleep.</p> \n<p>El-P, meanwhile, wrote the soundtrack for Capone, the acclaimed Tom Hardy movie about the gangster\u2019s decline into dementia. When they reconvened, in the hallowed environs of New York\u2019s Electric Ladyland and Miami\u2019s Shangri-La studios, \u201cwith Bruce Springsteen sauntering by to take a leak and being nice to us, and Rick Rubin coming in and doing yoga and giving us comments\u201d, they found themselves making a noticeably different album.</p> \n<p>Their previous record, RTJ3, was completed before Trump\u2019s presidency began, and was, says Mike, \u201ca blue record, like Picasso mourning the death of a friend \u2026 There were times in the last record when I was set to go to the studio and record, and I would turn on the news and see another black man has been murdered on our streets and I\u2019d just break: \u2018El, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t come today.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Its successor has a less elegiac energy. \u201cWith this record, you know how life pushes you on your hands the first time, you sit there for a minute like, \u2018Goddamn, what the fuck?\u2019 You\u2019re fearful of living? Then you get up and you run. You run towards the anger and the danger and the wild frenetic good times that is hip-hop.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat was the spirit of this record: we\u2019re going to tighten up, we\u2019re going to hardcore, people will think we\u2019re going to become some emo band but that\u2019s not what we are. We\u2019re Run the Jewels \u2026 we\u2019ll punch you in the face.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If anything, it\u2019s a source of mild discomfort to us that our music is seemingly relevant</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>And so the beats are markedly harder, the contrast between the righteous fury of their sociopolitical rhymes and those that deal with goofy \u201cstupid shit\u201d \u2013 which is as much a part of their appeal as their more serious side \u2013<strong> </strong>more starkly pronounced.</p> \n<p>\u201cLiterally, we were looking up from the table,\u201d says El-P, \u201cand I\u2019m like, \u2018OK, here I\u2019m talking about a cat shitting on my carpet and Mike\u2019s talking about shooting a poodle, and then in the next song we\u2019ve got [Rage Against the Machine\u2019s vocalist] Zack de la Rocha talking about police brutality.\u2019 You\u2019re hearing who we really are. Me and Mike agree on a lot, not only just the deep shit. We agree that it\u2019s funny to talk wildly about obviously ridiculous over-the-top violence towards a poodle.\u201d</p> \n<p>For their music\u2019s apparent currency, Mike says he isn\u2019t sure about the \u201cright band for the times\u201d line. \u201cWhen I rap, I\u2019m not reacting to the time, I\u2019m just rapping about the societal conditions. I\u2019m not specifically talking about anyone because those names are interchangeable. Trump is interchangeable with Nixon is interchangeable with Reagan is interchangeable with so many other evil motherfuckers who have held that office.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs bad as Trump is for our time, imagine what it was like when other presidents were in even worse times, when Eugene Debs [an American socialist] was running for president against Woodrow Wilson \u2013 they locked him up [on charges of sedition for his opposition to the first world war].\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cIf anything, it\u2019s a source of mild discomfort to us that our music is seemingly relevant,\u201d sighs El-P. \u201cThe best thing that could ever happen to the world is if Run the Jewels was just blathering nonsense, if we\u2019re just two assholes who are completely out of touch with reality. We don\u2019t want this shit to be on point. It\u2019s because of that truth that we allow ourselves to be completely stupid and surreal on our records as well. We need that, too.\u201d</p> \n<p>And, as if to prove their point, they move on to talking about their plans for a Run the Jewels feature film: \u201cA buddy criminal action comedy \u2026 a fucked-up version of The Blues Brothers.\u201d \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s very possible that it will happen,\u201d smiles El-P. \u201cHopefully, you\u2019ll see me and Mike screeching through the streets in a Grand National, shooting Nazis.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 RTJ4 is released on 5 June on Jewel Runners.</p>"

We have done it before</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The changes triggered by the protests are crucial, but more is needed to uproot the racism so thoroughly embedded in our nation\u2019s social, economic, and political systems. Public policies of the past helped create our current practices of exclusion and disinvestment. For instance, today\u2019s residential segregation is the direct result of 20th century <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america\">mortgage lending policies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/21/garden/restrictive-covenants-stubbornly-stay-on-the-books.html\">restrictive housing covenants</a> that limited where Black people could live. Time has <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/redlining-what-is-history-mike-bloomberg-comments/\">not much altered</a> these discriminatory patterns; only policy change can do so.</p> <p>Now is our chance to escalate the energy of the moment and move from protest to power to policy change. We have done it before.</p> <p>One of the most celebrated protests in US history, the 1963 March on Washington, forced America\u2019s attention to the fight for civil rights and voting rights. The voting rights campaign was led by NAACP local branches, which embraced the young activists from <a href=\"https://snccdigital.org/inside-sncc/the-story-of-sncc/\">SNCC</a> and <a href=\"https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/congress-racial-equality-core\">Core</a> who led the sit-ins and Freedom Rides of the early 1960s and passed on to them years of experience in struggle.</p> <p>I attended Tougaloo College, an HBCU in Mississippi where I had the opportunity to be trained in activism by veteran organizers from the NAACP, SNCC, and other civil rights organizations. I often listened to these elders revisit the strategy debates of that era, and I was struck by the clarity of their vision. It helped me to understand how the 1963 march changed the political climate in America. This shift led to the <a href=\"https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/freedom-summer\">Freedom Summer</a> in Mississippi in 1964 and created favorable conditions for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which finally outlawed tactics such as poll taxes and literacy tests that had disenfranchised the <a href=\"https://www.nypl.org/blog/2018/11/01/history-voter-suppression-dr-carol-anderson-ep-239\">vast majority</a> of Black voters in the south.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/18/why-antiracist-protests-are-achieving-more-progress-under-trump-than-obama\">Why antiracism protests are achieving more progress under Trump than Obama | Cas Mudde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today\u2019s nationwide protests have created an unprecedented alignment of people who look like America, all of us standing together for justice. We must use that people power to transform not only hearts and minds, but laws and leadership. The most direct and urgent route is through the vote.</p> <p>Trump has proven to be a danger to the health and safety of everyone in America, Black people in particular. Elective offices farther down the ballot also impact Black people\u2019s daily lives: the school board members who shape our children\u2019s education; the district attorneys who decide whether to file charges; the mayors and city council members who hire police chiefs and determine police department policies.</p> <p>After voting with our feet in protest, we must use the power of the ballot box to send a new and forceful message about the policy solutions we demand and the values of racial justice those policies must embody.</p> <p>Like the March on Washington, today\u2019s protests are catalysts for change. They have opened the eyes of a nation so we can transform the issue of racial justice from a partisan debate to a national soul-searching, through which people of all colors can use the tools of democracy to create a better and more just future for our families and our country. Even as we march, we must fight \u2013 and vote \u2013 for our very lives.</p> <ul> <li><p>Derrick Johnson is the president and CEO of the NAACP.

International correspondent Michael Safi speaks to scientists about what that might look like. Will it be peaks and troughs or another huge spike?&nbsp;</p> <p>We also report from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil\">Brazil</a>, where Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s handling of Covid-19 has been disastrous. It is now the third-deadliest country for victims of the disease. But as Ed Augustin reports from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/cuba\">Cuba</a>, there is a proven way to handle an outbreak. Elsewhere, our global environment editor Jonathan Watts looks to some of the greenest cities in the world to see how we might keep quarantine pollution levels in a post-lockdown world, while Laura Spinney reports on the \u201cdark matter\u201d that has seemingly protected some people and places against the worst of this virus.</p> <p>In our culture section Run the Jewels, aka Killer Mike and El-P, also reflect on the Floyd killing and the subsequent protests as well as their \u201csurreal\u201d new album RTJ4. In opinion, Misha Glenny looks at how organised crime has regrouped as lockdowns have begun to ease and Steven Poole reviews a new book about the radical power of boredom.</p> <p><a href=\"https://support.theguardian.com/uk/subscribe/weekly?promoCode=WWM62X\">Get the Guardian Weekly delivered to your home</a></p>"

His job approval rating has dipped sharply in recent days. Based on an average of 12 polls taken since 25 May the day Floyd was killed, it stands at about 43%, with 54% disapproving.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s loyalist \u201cbase\u201d is said to comprise 25-30% of voters. The remainder of the 46% who backed him in 2016 will not necessarily do so again. There are signs that key voter groups are less committed \u2013 or more fiercely opposed.</p> <p>A recent survey of white Christian evangelicals showed a 15% drop in support for Trump support. Among white Catholics, it dropped by 27%.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Biden\u2019s appeal among African-Americans could provide him with winning margins in swing states</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>&nbsp;Many white suburban women deserted the Republicans in the 2018 mid-terms. This group may be further alienated by the health crisis, economic uncertainty, and Trump\u2019s divisiveness.&nbsp;Older voters suffering the brunt of the pandemic are said to feel abandoned while the electorate as whole is getting younger. And for the first time, a third of eligible voters are non-white.</p> <p>Revived fury over racial injustice may galvanise the black vote \u2013 a crucial 12.5% of the electorate \u2013 against the president. In 2016, black turnout declined for the first time in 20 years.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s appeal among African-Americans, demonstrated in the primaries, could reverse that trend and provide winning margins in swing states. Among all voters, Biden\u2019s current lead is 11%.</p> <p>Yet Trump has been written off before. He has the advantage of incumbency and an enormous war chest. He plays dirty. By autumn, the economy may have revived, and the pandemic subsided. And gaffe-prone Biden carries much baggage.</p> <p>The protests may have scared as many Middle America voters as they energised. Nobody knows how Trump\u2019s Nixonian appeals to the \u201csilent majority\u201d and \u201claw and order\u201d will play in Peoria.</p> <p>One thing is certain: he\u2019s a long way from beaten.</p>"

He also said he signed </strong>legislation sanctioning China for suppressing freedoms in Hong Kong, following a Chinese national security law that gives Beijing unprecedented power over Hong Kong. He spent most of the press conference criticizing Joe Biden, in what closely resembled a campaign speech. </li> <li><strong>The Dakota Access pipeline was allowed to continue pumping oil after an appellate court issued a stay </strong>on a lower court order requiring that the pipeline stop operations by 5 August.</li> <li><strong>Trump responded to a question on the police killing of George Floyd by saying more white Americans are killed by police. </strong>Asked in a CBS News interview why black Americans are \u201cstill dying at the hands of law enforcement in this country,\u201d Trump replied, \u201cSo are white people. ... More people, by the way.

He identifies several factors peculiar to the state which may have had an impact:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Partisanship is hard-edged here, and not wearing a mask has become a mark of Republican tribal identity. Skepticism of science and experts, along with ingrained contrarianism \u2013 some otherwise sane Floridians I know resolutely maintain that the virus is a hoax, or no worse than seasonal flu \u2013 surely plays a role in some cases as well.</p> <p>Floridians historically have shown a ferocious individualism and an unwillingness to abide by state government restrictions. In addition, the severe economic damage inflicted by the shutdown surely has made people more willing to engage in magical thinking about how the dangers of the virus have been inflated by the media and the establishment, including the mistaken belief that hot weather prevents virus spread.</p> </blockquote> <p>Kabaservice also wonders about the long-term implications for US politics<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The pandemic laid bare the incompetence of the Trump administration, which took much too long to put widespread testing in place and has yet to implement contact tracing on the scale that\u2019s needed. But the pandemic also has shown the weakness of America\u2019s federal structure and its insufficient state capacity relative to other developed countries, where governments have implemented more uniform and effective national responses. Perhaps one of the pandemic\u2019s legacies will be greater citizen insistence on competent government.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read it here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/jul/13/florida-coronavirus-outbreak\"><strong>Geoffrey Kabaservice \u2013 I\u2019m from Florida.

As she puts it, on one side are parents saying, let kids be kids. They object to masks and social distancing in classrooms arguing both could hurt their children\u2019s well-being.<br>On the other side are parents and teachers who call for safeguards that would have been unimaginable before the coronavirus pandemic: part-time school, face coverings for all or a fully online curriculum.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me my kid has to wear a mask,\u201d Kim Sherman, a mother of three in the central California city of Clovis who describes herself as very conservative and very pro-Trump, told Gecker. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be dictated to to tell me how best to raise my kids.\u201d<br></p> <p>Some parents have threatened to pull their children and the funding they provide if masks are required. Hillary Salway, a mother of three in Orange County, California, is part of a vocal minority calling for schools to fully open with \u201cnormal social interaction.\u201d</p> <p>If the district requires masks for her son\u2019s kindergarten class, she says, \u201cI don\u2019t know if my son will be starting his educational career in the public school system this fall.\u201d</p> <p>She wants him to feel free to hug his teacher and friends and can\u2019t imagine sending him to a school where he\u2019ll get reprimanded for sharing a toy. She started a petition last month urging her district to \u201ckeep facial expressions visually available\u201d and helped organize a protest of over 100 people outside the district office, with signs saying, \u201cNo to masks, Yes to recess,\u201d and \u201cLet me breathe.\u201d<br></p> <p>Supporters argue that face coverings are ineffective, give a false sense of security, and are potentially detrimental.<br></p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says masks may help prevent infected people from spreading the virus to others and urged students and teachers to wear them whenever feasible. Democratic <strong>Gov. Gavin Newsom</strong> has ordered Californians to wear them in public.</p> <p><strong>Brooke Aston Harper</strong>, a liberal parent who attended a particularly spirited Orange County education board meeting recently, said it was \u201chorrifying\u201d that speakers were \u201cimposing their small worldview on all of us.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking for a fight, I just want us to take precautions,\u201d said Harper, whose children are 4 and 6.<br>She also started a petition, calling on schools to follow state guidelines that include masks for teachers and students, constant social distancing on campuses and other measures.<br></p> <p>\u201cFor each school board, the question is going to be: What does our community want, and who is the loudest?\u201d she said.<br><br>\u201cI will be wearing a mask, a face shield, possibly gloves, and I\u2019m even considering getting some type of body covering to wear,\u201d says <strong>Stacey Pugh</strong>, a fifth-grade teacher in suburban Houston. She hopes her Aldine district will mandate masks for students. \u201cCome the fall, we\u2019re going to be the front-line workers,\u201d said Pugh.</p> <p>Many small, rural communities argue they shouldn\u2019t have to comply with the same rules as big cities, where infection rates are higher.<br></p> <p><strong>Craig Guensler</strong>, superintendent of a small district in California\u2019s mostly rural Yuba County, says officials will try to follow state mandates. They have spent $25,000 on what he calls \u201cspit guards, for lack of a better term\u201d - clear Plexiglas dividers to separate desks at Wheatland Unified School District\u2019s four schools.<br></p> <p>Eighty-five percent of parents said in a survey they want their kids in school full time. Officials will space out desks as much as possible but still expect up to 28 in each classroom, Guensler said. Many parents are adamant their children not wear masks, and he suspects they will find loopholes if California requires them.<br></p> <p>\u201cOur expectation is we\u2019re going to get pummelled with pediatricians writing notes, saying, \u2018My child can\u2019t wear a mask,\u2019\u201d he said.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5f0d91cf8f08a59604b63510\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-07-14T11:12:02.747Z\">12.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Talking of fall reopenings, <strong>vice president Mike Pence</strong> is due in <strong>Baton Rouge, Louisiana</strong> today, and one of the items on his agenda is a visit to <strong>Louisiana State University\u2019s Tiger Stadium</strong> to discuss colleges reopening, and how to get college sport up and running again.</p> <p>His visit comes as the state becomes one of the nation\u2019s coronavirus hotspots.

The FIA is a signatory to the Olympic charter which forbids any form of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda.</p> <p>In Sochi, Hamilton was unapologetic. \u201cI don\u2019t regret a single moment of it,\u201d he said. \u201cI follow my heart and do what is right and that was me following my heart. I did something that has never really happened in F1 and obviously they will stop it from happening moving forwards. </p> <p>\u201cPeople talk about sport not being a place for politics but ultimately it is a human rights issue and that is something we should be pushing towards. We have a huge, amazing group of people that watch our sport from different backgrounds and cultures and we should be pushing positive messages towards them, especially for equality.\u201d</p> <p>He said he had not spoken with the FIA. Hamilton has led the call for change since the killing of George Floyd and his stance has encouraged other drivers to speak out and for F1 to adopt a strong public anti-racism stance. The world champion conceded that the process was one that was evolving across F1 but also stressed he believed his actions in wearing the T-shirt had proved to be a potent weapon in drawing attention to racial injustice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/23/stefano-domenicali-to-become-new-chief-executive-of-formula-one-lewis-hamilton\">Stefano Domenicali to become new chief executive of Formula One</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is a learning process for everyone\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have been happy with the norm here of how life and society has operated but the world and the younger generation in particular are more conscious that things aren\u2019t equal and that change is needed. It takes conversations with people and things like Mugello to spark a conversation that perhaps would never have taken place.\u201d</p> <p>He was also unsure that the FIA yet fully grasped the importance of the cause he is championing nor how difficult it might be. \u201cI will continue to work with them but do I believe they fully understand? I don\u2019t know. Perhaps in the future we all will to the same extent,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that is going to change overnight, it will take a long, long time. It won\u2019t be over in my career or even in my lifetime but the goal is to change things for future generations.\u201d</p> <p>Hamilton goes into the race at Sochi leading the word championship by 55 points from his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas.

But none of the three men said anything to suggest that the Ferguson assessment might be wrong. On Sunday, when another epidemiologist, <strong>Prof John Edmunds</strong>, made a very similar claim on the Andrew Marr show, <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, the health secretary, was asked out right if he agreed <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/07062001.pdf\">and he said no. </a>Johnson may have decided that the claim is too plausible to dismiss outright. <strong>Whitty</strong> stressed that, at the time when decisions about the lockdown were being taken, they had \u201cvery limited information about this virus\u201d.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/support-bubble-plan-lets-single-parents-in-england-combine-households\">Johnson announced that around 11 million people living alone or as single parents will be allowed to combine with another household to form a \u201csupport bubble\u201d in England.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said the coronavirus pandemic had \u201ca long way to go\u201d.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are lots of things, lots of data, things that we still don\u2019t know, and this epidemic has a long way to go, alas.

So had we introduced lockdown measures a week earlier, we would have reduced the final death toll by at least a half.</p> \n   <p>Whilst I think the measures, given what we knew about this virus then, in terms of its transmission and its lethality, were warranted, I\u2019m second guessing at this point, certainly had we introduced them earlier we would have seen many fewer deaths. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69889190-90d6-40f1-a768-cffabc2d8ce4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SKNpCBBuVws?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Ferguson said he also agreed with <strong>Prof John Edmunds</strong>, another epidemic modelling specialist, based at the London School of Hygiene and Tropic Medicine. Edmunds sits on the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (as Ferguson did, until he had to resign in May), and on Sunday Ferguson <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/07062003.pdf\">told the Marr Show: </a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We should have gone into lockdown earlier. I think it would have been hard to do it, and I think the data that we were dealing with in the early part of March, and our current situational awareness was really quite poor. And so I think it would have been very hard to pull the trigger at that point, but I wish we had. I wish we had gone into lockdown earlier. I think that has cost a lot of lives unfortunately.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>After Edmunds made this claim on Sunday ministers hit back hard, and it is not hard to see why. The UK government introduced a full lockdown after most other European countries (see the chart below, from <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2020-03-30-COVID19-Report-13.pdf\">this paper)</a> and it has been claimed that this was, at least in part, because Johnson had a strong, libertarian aversion to measures of this kind.

And then there are other days when it struggles hard to get much beyond the \u2018so what\u2019 territory. Today was closer to the latter category. Despite all talk of unease on the Tory benches (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/10/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-updates-furlough-pmqs-covid-19-latest?page=with:block-5ee0a35d8f0860ca20fa95f7#block-5ee0a35d8f0860ca20fa95f7\">10.17am)</a>, not a peep emerged. The Black Lives Matters protests did come up, but only in a relatively perfunctory manner. And the Boris Johnson/Keir Starmer exchanges - normally the highlight - were inconclusive. Neither was particularly good.</p> \n  <p>Starmer seems to view PMQs as a war of attrition; he shows no interest in flash, \u2018knockout blow\u2019 moments, preferring a steady stream that portray the opposition as measured and sensible, and Johnson as negligent. Mostly this has worked well, but it did not particularly today. He devoted his first two questions to asking why measures in reports weren\u2019t being implemented. But they are, claimed Johnson. This may be wishful thinking, but it was not contested by Starmer, and a viewer without prior knowledge may have been left wondering if Johnson had a point.</p> \n  <p>Starmer\u2019s best question was his third, about the death numbers. He was calm and factual, and his question - \u201cthere\u2019s no pride in these numbers, is there?\u201d - was unanswerable. Johnson\u2019s response was particularly poor. If No 10 really thinks it will be able to hold off addressing this issue for the rest of the year just by claiming it\u2019s too early to make international comparisons, it is likely to be disappointed.</p> \n  <p>Johnson\u2019s best moments came when Starmer asked about schools, and Johnson was able to accuse Labour of inconsistency - arguing for continued closures earlier, complaining about continued closures now. This is not wholly fair - Labour\u2019s argument is that a more consensual approach was needed to facilitate school opening - but defending a nuanced position is never straightforward, and by the standards of political sloganising rather than high-grade logic, Johnson\u2019s charge was true enough to stick. It was also interesting to see him use Starmer\u2019s profession against him. Generally commentators have taken the view the Starmer\u2019s lawyerly precision (we are not allowed call him \u201cforensic\u201d any more, the clich\u00e9 police have ruled) is a bonus, but Johnson now seems to running the line that, because Starmer is a barrister, he will just say whatever is convenient to his case.</p> \n  <p>Johnson actually had an announcement to make: a \u00a363m welfare programme for schools. But the way he raised it, it was hard to tell whether or not this was anything new. If this was supposed to give him good ammunition to use against Starmer, it did not work out.</p> \n  <p>The best question of the day was probably Kirsty Blackman\u2019s. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/10/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-updates-furlough-pmqs-covid-19-latest?page=with:block-5ee0c3858f08758335229663#block-5ee0c3858f08758335229663\"> 12.28pm.) </a>But even that did not generate a memorable answer.

Tory MPs believe cutting the 2-metre rule down to 1 meter is absolutely at the heart of the wider opening of the economy \u2026 One very senior Tory MP said to me: \u2018Our leadership is pitiful. Boris Johnson needs to be honest. Opening up the economy brings risks.

A video by a witness went viral and spurred protests over police bias and brutality and wider issues of societal racism.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou saw some very good people protesting, but you saw some bad people also,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd you get somebody in a chokehold. What are you going to do now? Let go and say, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s start all over again\u2019?\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump later said be believed chokeholds to be theoretically acceptable, but he acknowledged they are often used inappropriately by police.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think the concept of chokeholds sounds so innocent and so perfect,\u201d Trump said, adding that \u201cyou have to be careful. With that being said, it would be, I think, a very good thing that, generally speaking, it should be ended.\u201d</p> \n<p>The remarks followed action by a number of US cities and states towards banning police chokeholds. In the latest such move, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo<strong> </strong>signed legislation on Friday morning to ban chokeholds in the state.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\"

Yes, there were the chases, thrills and spills, but it was more than that. \u201cThere was always that sense in me, as a kid, that I like fairness, I want to help people, to be the good guy.\u201d</p> <p>He was 11 when his life was turned on its head. The date, Saturday 28 September 1985, is etched in his mind. It was 7am and the family were in bed at home in Brixton, south London. Lawrence was sharing the downstairs bedroom with his mother Cherry, father Leo and older sister Sharon. (His sister Juliet, who was six months pregnant, was in her bedroom, while his younger sister Lisa and two children of a family friend were asleep in the living room.) Lawrence liked sharing; it made him feel secure. But suddenly there was an almighty crash. His mother jumped out of bed to see what was happening. The next thing Lawrence heard was a gunshot.</p> <p>The bedroom door had been smashed down. Lawrence saw his mother on the floor and a man still pointing his revolver at her. She had been shot in the spine. \u201cI heard her saying she could not feel her legs, she couldn\u2019t breathe and she was going to die.\u201d Lawrence screamed at the officer that he\u2019d kill him if he touched his mother again. He says the officer then pointed his gun at him and said, \u201cSomebody had better shut this fucking kid up.\u201d</p> <p>It gradually dawned on the family that the man with the gun was not an armed burglar but a police officer. The scene became hellish. Thirty armed men emerged from nowhere, yelling incoherently, dogs straining on their leashes. In a horrifically botched dawn raid, the police had been looking for Lawrence\u2019s 21-year-old brother Michael, who had allegedly threatened officers with a sawn-off shotgun a few days earlier.</p> <p>By the time the ambulance arrived, Lawrence had abandoned any thought of working for the police. His father followed his mother to hospital and the children were left with two police officers \u2013 colleagues of the man who had shot their mother. Lawrence\u2019s world had imploded, and the shooting was also about to send shockwaves through London: rumours circulated that Lawrence\u2019s mother had died and there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/sep/30/brixton-riots-1985-archive\" title=\"\">a two-day uprising</a> in Brixton, with 10 police officers and dozens of civilians reported injured, and one dead.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Lee Lawrence, now 46, is a gentle, dignified man. He does not swear lightly, but when he thinks back to that day he can\u2019t help himself. \u201cExcuse my language, but the headfuck around that. I\u2019d never experienced anything negatively with the police \u2013 and now I\u2019m left in the house with these two officers, and you\u2019re from the same team, or gang, that\u2019s just done that to my mum. How have we been left with you? How can I trust you?\u201d</p> <p>Thirty-five years on, Lawrence has written a book about the impact that day had on his family. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-louder-i-will-sing-9780751581041.html\" title=\"\">The Louder I Will Sing</a> is a powerful, moving memoir \u2013 part rite of passage, part love letter to his mother, Dorothy \u201cCherry\u201d Groce, and part instruction manual on how to fight for justice. The book takes its title from the Labi Siffre song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xenWEbokhQo\" title=\"\">Something Inside So Strong</a> (\u201cThe more you refuse to hear my voice, the louder I will sing\u201d). It took him three decades to gain justice for Groce, who was left paralysed below the chest \u2013 and it was a very different kind of justice from that which he had envisioned.</p> <p>Groce, who was 37 when she was shot, was hospitalised for two years afterwards. The siblings were split between different carers: two sisters went on to have traumatic childhoods and often missed school. Lawrence, meanwhile, would visit his mother in hospital every day after school and stay with her until throwing-out time. School, hospital, sleep became his life.</p> <p>When she left hospital, Groce was rehoused in a bungalow in nearby Gipsy Hill, with Lawrence, Sharon and Lisa. Leo had by then largely vanished from their lives, so Lawrence, barely 13, became the man of the house. Did they talk about what had happened? He shakes his head. \u201cNo. We never talked about it.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2e387116b5b22fa77ace16cbb3570aba2dd4fa36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e387116b5b22fa77ace16cbb3570aba2dd4fa36/16_16_281_377/281.jpg\" alt=\"https://composer.gutools.co.uk/content/5f356b6e8f08d485ec34a0c1\" width=\"281\" height=\"377\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Groce in her early 20s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Lee Lawrence</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Groce had been a strong, fun-loving free spirit. Her son\u2019s book starts in 1982, with her returning home from Brixton market with a new single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lUqpjMwqEI\" title=\"\">Someone Loves You Honey</a>, by June Lodge and Prince Mohammed. She puts it on the turntable and invites her children to dance. This is his abiding memory of her before the police raid: young, beautiful, a tiny ball (she was 4ft 10in) of dancing energy. She had worked as a secretary and a cleaner, and gone on to bring up her six children almost single-handed.</p> <p>When she left hospital, Groce tried to carry on as if nothing had happened, cooking for the family and vacuuming from her wheelchair. But, in pain and unable to look after her children as she once had, she gradually withdrew, becoming reserved and occasionally sharp-tongued. Every day before school Lawrence would ask if she wanted a cup of tea. One day she lashed out and asked why he didn\u2019t just make it, instead of always asking. She hated their role reversal and retreated to her bedroom and her books, reading up on African and Jamaican history. Groce had moved to England when she was 15 and was proud of her Maroon lineage: the Maroons had fought against the British, escaped slavery and established free communities in the mountains of Jamaica. But when she talked to her teenage son about this, he felt confused: \u201cI used to be like, \u2018Mum, it\u2019s too deep for me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He began to ask his own questions. Why had he been given no support after the shooting? \u201cTwo weeks later, I was back at school. No teacher ever said, \u2018How d\u2019you feel about what happened?\u2019 No adult ever asked. So you\u2019re bottling all this anger.\u201d He had a recurring nightmare that he was shot and began to resent his father and brother Michael: \u201cThe two male figures I should have been able to look to for support had disappeared. I felt they had abandoned my mum.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mum said, \u2018The police are a force and we can't beat the force.\u2019 I thought, I'm never going to accept that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Up until the shooting, Leo had visited at weekends, cooking mouthwatering goat curry and Jamaican stewed chicken, but he was not a reliable parent, often drunk and sometimes aggressive. He insisted the two children he had with Groce (Lawrence and Lisa) call him Leo rather than Dad. Lawrence was later reconciled with Leo, who died earlier this year. As for Michael, Lawrence regarded him as a \u201cnovelty\u201d older brother, who would occasionally turn up and show him an exciting time. Michael is now a poet and community worker, but then he was in and out of jail. Lawrence was an old-fashioned boy: he believed it was a man\u2019s responsibility to look after women, so if his father and older brother weren\u2019t there for his mother, he would make sure he was.</p> <p>In January 1987, 16 months after the shooting and having faced criminal charges, the officer who fired the shot, Inspector Douglas Lovelock, was acquitted at the Old Bailey of maliciously wounding Groce. To Lawrence\u2019s astonishment and anger, his mother accepted the verdict. \u201cI was so upset, I was shaking. Mum said, \u2018Lee, the police are a force. And we can\u2019t beat the force.\u2019 I thought, I\u2019m never going to accept that.\u201d For a long time he imagined hunting down Lovelock and exacting vigilante revenge. Did he ever come close? \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say close. But I remember asking questions about how to find him.\u201d</p> <p>Lawrence was 13 or 14 when he next came into contact with the police. He was riding pillion on a friend\u2019s moped, which turned out to be stolen. The arresting officer called him a monkey. He was so shocked, he burst out laughing. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. I thought, \u2018This only happens in movies.\u2019 And that hardened me. It was like, so this is really how you see us?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4aace8462ab22e1f7e9a59e53778a49855c8bbe4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4aace8462ab22e1f7e9a59e53778a49855c8bbe4/118_661_2020_2613/773.jpg\" alt=\"Cherry Groce with her brother Mervin in 1897, going to the Old Bailey trial of the police officer who shot her\" width=\"773\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Groce with her brother Mervin in 1987, at the Old Bailey trial of the police officer who shot her.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Lee Lawrence</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the teenage Lawrence became more politicised, he began to wonder why nobody seemed interested in his mother\u2019s story. \u201cIn Black History Month, there would be programmes on telly about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1981/apr/13/fromthearchive\" title=\"\">the 1981 uprisings</a>, but when it came to 1985, and a woman shot in her home in front of her children, it was skimmed over. There was a little flame inside of me from that point.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>We are in the middle of an August heatwave when I meet Lawrence in London, but he manages to look smart even in denim shorts and a T-shirt. He tells me he could never ask his mother for new trainers because money was so tight, so he tried to steal them. He was a hopeless thief and got caught; the security guard looked at his worn trainers, took pity on him and let him off. But he was about to get better at outsmarting the authorities. After leaving school at 15, he decided the only way he could look after his mother and sisters was by selling drugs. \u201cI saw myself as a businessman, and this was a means to an end. I would never refer to myself as a dealer.\u201d He stresses he never sold to street addicts. \u201cMy clients were rich, traders. They spoke like they were part of the royal family.\u201d</p> <p>By 15, he had become known on the streets as Younger Cowboy, feeding off his older brother\u2019s tough reputation. An earlier persona had been Rudy Lee, part bad boy, part rude boy, and in his 20s he was Brandy Lee, because of his love of the drink. Tell me about Brandy Lee, I say. He laughs: a bit proud, a bit sheepish. \u201cOK, so Brandy Lee is charismatic, a smooth guy, a ladies man. A bit egotistical.\u201d He was also a devoted son and a full-time carer for his mother.</p> <p>I ask Lawrence how long he sold drugs for. \u201cYou want me to incriminate myself? Hehehe!\u201d He has a big, exuberant laugh. He won\u2019t give dates, but says he soon began to see the contradiction in his business plan: he was dealing drugs to provide stability for his family, all the while risking leaving them with nothing. By 21, he had a son, Brandon, and responsibilities, so he quit while he was ahead. He met his wife Gem when he was 28, had two daughters with her (Harmony, 12, and Ruby-Lee, eight) and settled down to a simpler life. By day he was his mother\u2019s official carer; in the evenings he DJed, organised events and ran a nightclub. In the early 2000s, he began to work as a black-cab driver.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aa41bba2818b5485a76ae108e86d620902c7410d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa41bba2818b5485a76ae108e86d620902c7410d/141_197_2107_3067/687.jpg\" alt=\"Three generations.

A week after Groce was shot, Cynthia Jarrett died of heart failure during a police search of her home in Tottenham, north London. Her death led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/aug/08/anger-tottenham-broadwater-riots-1985\" title=\"\">the Broadwater Farm riots</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/apr/09/pc-keith-blakelock-murder-timeline-nicholas-jacobs\" title=\"\">the killing of PC Keith Blakelock</a>. (Winston Silcott, Mark Braithwaite and Engin Raghip were convicted of Blakelock\u2019s murder in 1987; four years later, all three convictions were overturned when scientific tests showed Silcott\u2019s confession had been fabricated.)</p> <p>In 2010, Lawrence says, a friend went to a celebration of Jarrett\u2019s life. \u201cAnd he said to me, \u2018How come your mum\u2019s not recognised in that way?\u2019\u201d He told his mother he needed to do something to acknowledge her life and that his aunt, the actor <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1452416/\" title=\"\">Lorna Gayle</a>, was thinking of dramatising her story<strong>.</strong> \u201cShe didn\u2019t like the limelight, but I kept bugging her about it and eventually she said, \u2018OK, if you want to do something, do something.\u2019\u201d But he never got the chance while she was alive: Cherry Groce died of kidney failure in 2011, aged 63.</p> <p>By then, Lawrence was no longer interested in retributive justice. He helped put on Gayle\u2019s play, Her Story, at the Brixton Ritzy. In 2012, he decided a blue plaque should be put on the family home, still owned by Lambeth council, to celebrate his mother\u2019s life. When the council refused, he <a href=\"https://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/dorothy-cherry-groce\" title=\"\">went ahead anyway</a>.</p> <p>After Groce\u2019s death, the pathologist\u2019s report established a link between the shooting and the kidney failure that led to her death, triggering an inquest. But the family could not afford a lawyer and were refused legal aid. Lawrence approached his local MP, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/chukaumunna\" title=\"\">Chuka Umunna</a>, for support, and started a petition. By the time he handed it in to 10 Downing Street in April 2014, there were 130,000 signatures. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/apr/11/ministers-allow-legal-aid-funding-family-cherry-groce-inquest\" title=\"\">The</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/apr/11/ministers-allow-legal-aid-funding-family-cherry-groce-inquest\" title=\"\">family were granted legal aid</a>. \u201cFor the first time, I started to see people who didn\u2019t necessarily look like us supporting us. I thought, \u2018Look what we can achieve when we come together,\u2019\u201d Lawrence says.</p> <p>Shortly before the 2014 inquest, he discovered West Yorkshire police had investigated the shooting as an outside force, but the subsequent report had been buried. The family won a fight for disclosure and the findings of the 357-page report were damning. Assistant chief constable John Domaille had catalogued error after error<strong>,</strong> concluding: \u201cThe raid should not have gone ahead in the manner planned due to the total lack of information\u2026 grave risks were created both for public and police, which should have been avoided.\u201d The Metropolitan police accepted all of Domaille\u2019s findings.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wanted accountability for how my life and my sisters\u2019 lives were ruined because of police failures</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On 10 July 2014, 29 years after she had been shot, the inquest jury at Southwark coroner\u2019s court found that \u201cDorothy Groce was shot by police during a planned, forced entry raid at her home, and her subsequent death was contributed to by failures in the planning and implementation of the raid.\u201d The jury found there were failures to properly brief officers that Michael was no longer wanted by police; to adequately check who lived at the property; and to carry out adequate observations on the house.</p> <p>Lawrence was vindicated. \u201cThat acknowledgment was the greatest gift I could give to Mum in her absence,\u201d he says now. A major review of Met gun policy after the shooting had already led to a ban on detectives carrying firearms, and Groce had received \u00a3500,000 compensation in an out-of-court settlement in 1993, too late to stop Lawrence selling drugs, and too little to support her until she died. But the police had never formally apologised. Now, after the inquest, Met commissioner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/10/metropolitan-police-chief-apologises-cherry-groce-shooting\" title=\"\">Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe did</a>, admitting the police had caused \u201cirreparable damage\u201d.</p> <p>Lawrence told the police an apology wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cMy life and my sisters\u2019 lives were ruined because of what happened that day. I wanted accountability for how our lives were altered because of their failures,\u201d he says. When the Met refused to accept liability, the family returned to court. In 2016, the high court ruled that the Met had a duty of care to five of Groce\u2019s six children (excluding Michael because he wasn\u2019t in the house at the time, but including their sister Rose who had returned home straight after the shooting) and would have to pay them compensation.</p> <p>There was also the matter of justice, Lawrence says. \u201cThe man who shot my mum is still living his life. No one went to prison. No one was penalised.\u201d His lawyers, <a href=\"https://bhattmurphy.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Bhatt Murphy</a>, suggested the family could receive \u201crestorative justice\u201d, meeting the Met to explain the impact the shooting had had and finding ways for the Met to make amends. As part of that process, the Met agreed to the family\u2019s request to have a role in police training; for a programme to be developed to support people who had been traumatised as a result of wrongful police actions; and to make a contribution to the work of the <a href=\"https://weare336.org.uk/organisations/cherry-groce-foundation/\" title=\"\">Cherry Groce Foundation</a>, established in 2014 to support people in the community with mobility issues. Lawrence says the Met is yet to fully deliver on its promises.</p> <p>Since then Lawrence has worked as a voluntary consultant for the police \u2013 sitting on boards, going to passing out ceremonies at the Met\u2019s Hendon police college and completed a training session on the police complaints process. He is not impressed by what he\u2019s seen: \u201cThis is a system that is broken.\u201d Nor is he convinced the will is there to fix it. The Met is still overwhelmingly white (while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/11/2011-census-data-key-points\" title=\"\">the London population is 59.8% white</a>, its police force is <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/police-workforce/latest#by-ethnicity-police-officers\" title=\"\">85% white</a>) and is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-53407560?intlink_from_url=&amp;link_location=live-reporting-story\" title=\"\">four times more likely</a> to use force against black people. Lawrence says he asked one graduating officer if they were taught negotiation skills and the officer said no: they were taught to make assumptions and work on the basis of those. Lawrence immediately thought of the assumptions he believed Lovelock had made all those years ago when he raided their home. \u201cThe danger is your assumptions are going to be based on your life experiences. How do you see that person? Are they always the criminal in your mind?\u201d</p> <p>He sits on the Met\u2019s professional standards board, and is beginning to wonder why. \u201cYou\u2019re just there to give a view. But they don\u2019t have to take your view on board. You don\u2019t see outcomes.\u201d</p> <p>In recent months, his frustrations have intensified. The fatal shooting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/breonna-taylor\" title=\"\">Breonna Taylor</a> this March, after police forcibly entered her flat in Louisville, US, brought back terrible memories, as did the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\" title=\"\">George Floyd</a> in Minneapolis. Like Groce, Floyd had told the police he couldn\u2019t breathe.</p> <p>Every day seems to bring a new story about reckless stop and searches of black people in Britain. In June, 24-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/24/man-paralysed-after-being-tasered-vows-to-get-justice-from-met-jordan-walker-brown\" title=\"\">Jordan Walker-Brown</a> was stopped by police. He ran away because, he said, he was carrying a small amount of cannabis. When the police Tasered him, he fell off a wall and was left paralysed from the chest down, just as Groce had been.</p> <p>A few years ago, Lawrence was stopped by the police after a cyclist rode into the back of his car at 10am one day. The cyclist had apologised, but the police still aggressively breathalysed Lawrence. \u201cA white lady came over and said, \u2018I\u2019m not moving, I\u2019m a witness.\u2019 The officer said, \u2018What for?\u2019 She goes, \u2018I see this every day. All you do is stop young black men and harass them.\u2019 That incident showed me there\u2019s still a lot to do.\u201d</p> <p>Would he walk away from working with the police at any point? He smiles. \u201cOf course. I\u2019m very close to it now. I\u2019m not seeing enough change. I\u2019ve got to worry about my own credibility, right?\u201d </p> <p>If he did walk away, he would have plenty to occupy him. After his mother\u2019s death, he started Mobility Taxis, a specialist firm for disabled people. Originally a one-man band, it quickly expanded, though it has suffered in the pandemic, with many customers shielding.</p> <p>Wherever Lawrence looks now, there are welcome reminders of his mother. A pavilion <a href=\"https://www.archdaily.com/943158/sir-david-adjaye-designs-brixton-memorial-to-honor-cherry-groce\" title=\"\">is being built</a> to remember her in Brixton\u2019s Windrush Square, designed by architect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/06/david-adjaye-architect-on-the-commissions-that-changed-his-approach-to-work\" title=\"\">Sir David Adjaye</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s inspired by the mountains of Jamaica and West Africa,\u201d Lawrence explains, \u201cwith Mum connecting the two. It\u2019s a place of reflection and shelter.\u201d Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://weare336.org.uk/organisations/cherry-groce-foundation/\" title=\"\">Cherry Groce Foundation</a> is creating a programme of teaching resources for schools across the country, to tell her story. The Met has agreed to sponsor a prize in her name, to be awarded to an officer who has done outstanding work in the community. As well as the book, a film about her life is planned.</p> <p>Of course, none of this can make up for what happened, Lawrence says. \u201cBut if I can say, \u2018Look at the positives that have happened as a result\u2019, I can live with it.\u201d For decades, he despaired at the fact that he had no control over his mother\u2019s narrative. Now he hopes that is about to change. \u201cTo most people, my mum is just the woman who was shot by the police. And that\u2019s it. Full stop. For me, she\u2019s so much more.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The Louder I Will Sing by Lee Lawrence is published by Sphere, an imprint of Little, Brown Book Group, on 17 September at \u00a316.99.

Now they must walk a fine line: those who share self-serving or half-hearted posts are being publicly canceled while others who don\u2019t speak up are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chuck_chizzle3/status/1270709309798666240\">being criticized</a> for their inaction.</p> <p>\u201cEven as recently as the 2016 election there was backlash to influencers getting too political,\u201d Hund said. \u201cNow the tides have completely turned and there is a strong expectation that they speak up and reflect on their own privilege and encourage their followers to do the same.\u201d</p> <p>The struggle is particularly pronounced for women, Hund said. She explored the phenomenon in a 2019 paper she co-authored titled Gendered Visibility on Social Media: Navigating Instagram\u2019s Authenticity Bind.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a pressure to voice an opinion, especially for those who have a significant following on Instagram,\u201d she said. \u201cMeanwhile, they are still operating within the constraints of a monetized personal brand.\u201d</p> <p>Influencers in the Wild has been tracking influencers posing among protesters, featuring <a href=\"https://twitter.com/influencersitw/status/1269626098826072064\">many</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/influencersitw/status/1269026067051929601\">different</a> examples. \u201cStop treating the protests like Coachella,\u201d a typical response to a video of a woman posing in a gown amid a march said.</p> <p>The account is run by George Resch, who also runs popular meme account Tanks Good News. He said the difference between authentically participating in the movement and using it as a photo op is obvious to most followers.</p> <p>\u201cSome people have co-opted the BLM movement in order to get content, and the problem with that and why it enraged people so much is that it is the single most egregious act of cultural appropriation you can imagine,\u201d he said. \u201cRepurposing your presence there for content strikes me as one of the most shallow things you can do.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/influencersitw/status/1269377343170269186\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Remember George Floyd<br>Remember Ahmaud Abrey<br>Remember Breonna Taylor<br>Remember Trayvon Martin<br>Forget about these two <a href=\"https://t.co/HX9zWwtPk3\">pic.twitter.com/HX9zWwtPk3</a></p>&mdash; influencersinthewild (@influencersitw) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/influencersitw/status/1269377343170269186?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 6, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>In perhaps the highest-profile recent example of influencing gone wrong, YouTuber Jake Paul is now <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/youtuber-jake-paul-charged-trespassing-following-arizona-looting-n1224906\">facing criminal charges</a> for entering a mall in Arizona to record social media content after it was looted. Following his arrest, Paul claimed he was there only to film what was happening to put on his YouTube channel. He subsequently posted a black square on his account in solidarity with Black Lives Matter, which was flooded with comments criticizing him for using the movement as a photo op: \u201cYet you took advantage of a riot?\u201d <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CA8NXFYjk_5/\">one comment read</a>. \u201cMy guy goes out looting and pretends to care, Jake you\u2019re a clown.\u201d</p> <p>Resch said he posts images of influencers using protests as a backdrop to condemn the action, not the person. \u201cI\u2019m not endorsing anyone tracking these people down,\u201d he said.</p> <p>According to Resch, focusing on tracking down the influencers he shares on the account to shame them or get them fired misses the point of his sharing them.</p> <p>\u201cPeople get fixated on calling out the individual because it relieves them of the responsibility of having to look at themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all need to change and evolve constantly and what this movement is about is looking at yourself and what you can do.\u201d</p>"

Before long, flames licked up the front of the building. A huge cheer went up. Someone let off fireworks.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo justice, no peace,\u201d came the cry. \u201cFuck the police.\u201d</p> \n<p>But there were no police in sight. A large area around the 3rd precinct, including the Minnehaha shopping mall and streets of businesses, was effectively under the control of the protesters without challenge overnight on Thursday.</p> \n<p>By the time the empty police station went up in flames, a handful of other buildings around it were already well ablaze. Others were comprehensively looted as outrage over Floyd\u2019s death drew a widespread peaceful protest to demand justice \u2013 in particular the arrest of the officers involved \u2013 and an outpouring of anger that turned to destruction.</p> \n<p>\u201cDamn right I\u2019m angry,\u201d said Brian Long, an African American man who worked as a mechanic until the coronavirus cut his job. \u201cThat cop suffocated George Floyd right there on camera for everyone to see. It was like strangling him with his bare hands. He knew people were watching. He knew he was being filmed.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe carried on because he had that mindset that the police can kill us and there ain\u2019t nothing we can do about it. Fuck the police.\u201d</p> \n<p>Melvin Carter, the mayor of St Paul, which neighbours Minneapolis and saw its own unrest, tweeted an appeal to end the violence and to \u201ckeep the focus on George Floyd \u2026 and on preventing this from ever happening again\u201d. But many of the protesters were not in the mood.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"877b9c6d-7c9c-4a97-827a-1b9af0c16314\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iwPPqDryPO8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Buildings burned across Minneapolis and St Paul late into the night, but the area around the 3rd precinct station felt different. Highly unusually, the police retreated entirely and left it to the protesters.</p> \n<p>Jacob Frey, the Minneapolis mayor, had said property wasn\u2019t worth dying for, and sought to avoid the kind of face-off between police and protesters that escalated confrontations and deaths during similar protests, such as in Ferguson six years ago, following the killing of Michael Brown by a police officer.</p> \n<p>It was a different story 15 minutes\u2019 drive away in St Paul, where the police fired rubber bullets and teargas to disperse a crowd of several hundred people attempting to break into another Target store. But that did not work either.</p> \n<p>As the mood worsened, groups broke away to attack other buildings, including a health clinic, restaurants and a phone store, which were set on fire.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f211650e0b38a4df627f4ad9af19f7e7f89abe70\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f211650e0b38a4df627f4ad9af19f7e7f89abe70/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flames rise from the police station.

Groups of young white people dressed in black spray-painted slogans denouncing the police, capitalism and corporate power.</p> \n<p>The warnings about social distancing because of coronavirus fell apart as the crowd swelled, but many discovered that their Covid-19 masks were also useful for shielding their identities.</p> \n<p>A few hours earlier, hundreds of people set off for downtown on a peaceful protest march, chanting demands for justice, and carrying signs that read \u201cI can\u2019t breathe!!\u201d and \u201cFuck Donald Trump\u201d. The marchers were accompanied by a large skull on a bike wearing a police hat.</p> \n<p>Other protesters stayed behind to hold a rally outside the police station. After several speeches about continuing racial injustice in America, and how the lessons from police killings of African American men rarely seem to be applied, a tussle broke out over whether attacks on buildings were a legitimate form of protest.</p> \n<p>An older generation of speakers said it would distract from the demands for justice for Floyd. That racists would use it to justify police violence.</p> \n<p>Kim Edwards, an African American man, appealed to people to stop the looting. He said the lesson of the past was to use economic boycotts to bring about change, because the political system responds to money. Destroying the shops people need only hurts the community, he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>As the mood worsened, groups attacked other buildings, including a health clinic, restaurants and a phone store</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cOur power is in our pocketbook, not burning down the buildings we need,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Others disagreed. To them, Floyd\u2019s death was symptomatic of the whole range of injustices that minorities and poor Americans live with. And corporate America is part of that, too.</p> \n<p>A young African American woman said people should look to the Los Angeles riots after the Rodney King verdict nearly 30 years ago.</p> \n<p>\u201cBurn this bitch down,\u201d she shouted.</p> \n<p>A man snatched the microphone back and admonished her.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe ain\u2019t going to burn nothing down.

A pawn shop was completely gutted. Others had what people wanted. A liquor store. A tobacco shop.</p> \n<p>The stripping of the Target store went on into the early hours of Friday morning. A steady stream of people waded through inches of water from the sprinklers set off by fires. By dawn, it had been plundered of everything from clothes to furniture and medicine. Water, soft drinks and snacks taken from the shelves were distributed free to protesters at a pop-up market in the car park.</p> \n<p>Wade Chen spent the night defending his family\u2019s laundry business next door to a looted convenience store and two badly damaged schools, although that did not stop a woman from smashing a window.</p> \n<p>\u201cDoing this hurts our community. People have to wash their clothes, they have to shop. Where are they going to go when they don\u2019t have transportation?\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/29/george-floyd-death-benjamin-crump-jasmine-rand\">The death of George Floyd was an act of murder, plain and simple | Ben Crump and Jasmine Rand</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Some owners painted \u201cminority owned\u201d on to the windows in the hopes of discouraging attacks, and that appeared to be enough in many cases. A man stood outside a store near the Target, telling anyone who came near that the business was owned by Somalis. People nodded and moved on.</p> \n<p>Every now and again, word swept through parts of the crowd that the national guard had arrived, and a stampede would begin before quickly fizzling out. But the military did not appear, and the few police officers who showed their faces were there to accompany firefighters working around the edges to ensure fires did not spread to residential neighbourhoods.</p> \n<p>As dawn broke on Friday morning, buildings still smouldered and burned, but the crowds were gone and the police were back. A few in riot gear blocked main roads into the area around the 3rd precinct. It did not look likely to deter another day and night of protest.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>From Hancock being forced to bin the test and trace app to Raab\u2019s BLM gaffe, who can rival the cabinet for incompetence?</p>",
     "body": "<p>For months now the government has been prefacing all its coronavirus briefings as world-beating when the only thing in which we appeared to be global leaders was our mortality rates. But now I\u2019m beginning to think Boris Johnson and his cabinet may have been on to something after all. Because it\u2019s beginning to look more and more as if we are genuine world beaters: if only in total incompetence.</p> <p>Check out the evidence. In Johnson we have a prime minister who lumbers from one screw-up to the next, blinded to his own failures by a narcissism that borders on the sociopathic. On Thursday, he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/18/emmanuel-macron-marks-de-gaulle-speech-anniversary-in-london-boris-johnson\">meeting President Macron</a> to celebrate the 80th anniversary of De Gaulle\u2019s speech to the French resistance: let\u2019s hope he didn\u2019t give Macron a copy of his book on why Churchill was exactly like Boris, in which he basically wrote off De Gaulle as completely useless.</p> <p>Then we have Dominic Raab. A foreign secretary who knows so little about foreign affairs and Black Lives Matters that he thought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/18/dominic-raab-taking-the-knee-feels-like-symbol-of-subjugation\">taking the knee was something out of Game of Thrones</a>. At this rate it would come as no surprise to find that Gavin Williamson had been labouring under the impression that the free school meals campaign had been inspired by Grange Hill. What did we do to deserve politicians quite so dim as this?</p> <p>But all the recent U-turns and moronic posturing are as nothing compared to the ongoing humiliation of Matt Hancock. Poor Matt. He started out with so many good intentions of being a better health secretary than his two predecessors, Andrew Lansley and Jeremy Hunt, but now just finds himself a worthy addition to the confederacy of dunces. His ambition easily outstripped his natural abilities and he merely lurches from crisis to crisis. You can see it in his eyes. His enthusiasm has been replaced by deep suspicion of everyone around him. He also looks dead on his feet. Mattbeth doth murder sleep.</p> <p>It was sod\u2019s law of course that Matt was sent out to take the Downing Street press conference on the day both the latest fairly rubbish human test and trace figures were published and the \u201cworld-beating\u201d app that had been promised for 1 June was finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/18/piloted-in-may-ditched-in-june-the-failure-of-englands-covid-19-app\">consigned to the dustbin</a>. Yet Hancock accepted his role and grudgingly took centre stage with Dido Harding, the chief executive of test and trace. There is no indignity that Boris could inflict that Matt wouldn\u2019t willingly suck up just to be allowed to keep his job for a few days or weeks longer because he doesn\u2019t have the self-worth to face Johnson down.</p> <p>Matt took a few deep breaths and tried to start off on an optimistic note. Although there was as yet no vaccine for the coronavirus, he had bought up massive supplies of all the ones that were being trialled just on the off chance that one of them happened to work. It was as good as an open invitation for any snake-oil salesman to come hammering at the Department of Health\u2019s door. Then Matt moved on to the figures for the human test and trace, which even he couldn\u2019t spin in a positive light as it appeared that the system was missing well over half the people with the coronavirus.</p> <p>Then he steadied himself and tackled the unhappy app situation head on. He had discovered months ago that the \u201cworld-beating\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/17/nhs-covid-19-contact-tracing-app-no-longer-a-priority-says-minister\">UK app was actually useless</a> as it couldn\u2019t connect with Apple phones, so he had secretly set up a second programme with Apple and Google to see if they could make their systems more effective. The Germans and Koreans might be happy with the distance at which the Apple system operated, but he wasn\u2019t. </p> <p>Here we came to the real genius of Hancock\u2019s cunning plan. Because faced with the choice of testing a system on the Isle of Wight that everyone knew didn\u2019t work or one that could possibly be improved, Matt had opted to waste several months testing the one that was a complete non-starter.</p> <p>Brilliant. This was \u201cworld-beating\u201d science at its absolute best. Testing the useless one was spearheading the international effort to show other countries precisely what not to do. It was an act of supreme \u201cworld-beating\u201d self sacrifice for the UK to take one for the global team. The 60,000 Brits who have died of Covid-19 could rest assured they hadn\u2019t done so in vain.</p> <p>Inevitably, Matt found himself struggling with the questions from journalists. All he could do was try to pretend that the \u201cworld-beating\u201d app had never been that important \u2013 \u201cthe cherry on Dido\u2019s cake\u201d \u2013 and that people shouldn\u2019t be too worried if it wasn\u2019t working properly until some time in the late autumn at the earliest. This after both Boris and Matt had been insistent that the app was key to relaxing lockdown restrictions, which was already taking place. It was beginning to sound as if the prime minister and health secretary were actively trying to kill people. Mattbeth doth murder more than sleep.</p> <p>In desperation, Matt handed over to Harding. Unfortunately, Dido is an equally unreliable narrator having not had tremendous success with data breaches at Talk Talk and giving the go-ahead to the Cheltenham festival a week after many scientists had been pleading for a lockdown. The baroness is one of that elite club of chief executives who consistently manages to fail upwards. So her insistence that though the test and trace figures were basically crap they were still better than nothing wasn\u2019t as reassuring as it might have been.</p> <p>The briefing ended in an uneasy truce, with Matt struggling to contain his tetchiness. There\u2019s only so much embarrassment even he can take. What he needed was a \u201cworld-beating\u201d hero on his side. If only he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/17/hancock-blames-daniel-rashford-slip-on-harry-potter-marcus-rashford\">had a number for Daniel Rashford</a>.</p>"

People will still \u201cbe able to retweet with comment, but will not be able to like, reply or retweet it.\u201d <br><br>Twitter\u2019s action came just hours after Trump said he would introduce legislation that may scrap or weaken a law that has protected internet companies, including Twitter and Facebook , in an extraordinary attempt to regulate social media platforms where he has been criticized. <br><br>The proposed legislation is part of an executive order Trump signed on Thursday afternoon. Trump had attacked Twitter for tagging tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud about mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact-check the posts.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed0c5358f087e3ca0f65921\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T08:25:12.740Z\">9.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Below are a selection of images on the events in Minneapolis as there was a third night of unrest in Minneapolis.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9162ce7fe8136248a2f5f6dfd169c0d4ee2715d\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9162ce7fe8136248a2f5f6dfd169c0d4ee2715d/0_154_4619_2774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protestors demonstrate outside of a burning fast food restaurant on Friday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protestors demonstrate outside of a burning fast food restaurant on Friday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Minchillo/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f56d67d6083ddc3323a937a8ee8831471ea88fb\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f56d67d6083ddc3323a937a8ee8831471ea88fb/0_146_4376_2628/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A police officer tosses a tear gas canister towards protestors on Hamline Avenue on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A police officer tosses a tear gas canister towards protestors on Hamline Avenue on Thursday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Minchillo/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abe209f14dd40ee4588f1a3481f26ddbb0cdd360\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abe209f14dd40ee4588f1a3481f26ddbb0cdd360/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A building burns along University Avenue during a protest, Thursday, May 28, 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A building burns along University Avenue during a protest, Thursday, May 28, 2020.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Minchillo/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e87541b6172aee21408e6ef9d97ab477e7ae0d3\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e87541b6172aee21408e6ef9d97ab477e7ae0d3/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"protestors\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather outside the 3rd precinct police building while it burns on May 28, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed0c08b8f0898700351e63a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T07:59:14.899Z\">8.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Twitter said that it blocked a post by Donald Trump on Twitter for policy violation, \u201cregarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line\u201d.

Elsewhere, businesses were looted and blazes set as the evening wore on.</li> \n   <li><strong>Donald Trump tweeted about the protests, calling those involved \u201cthugs\u201d and threatening to send in the national guard.</strong> Trump described the city\u2019s mayor, Jacob Frey, \u201cvery weak\u201d and wrote: \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>In response, to the president\u2019s comments, Frey said during a press briefing: \u201cWeakness is pointing your finger at someone else during a time of crisis.\u201d</strong> The city\u2019s mayor said he had ordered the evacuation of officers from the 3rd precinct after reports of \u201cimminent threats to both officers and the public\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Minnesota National Guard </strong><strong>sent 500 soldiers to St Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding areas after the state\u2019s governor</strong><strong> declared a state of emergency. </strong>Governor Walz wrote in the proclamation that he supported peaceful protests but \u201cunfortunately, some individuals have engaged in unlawful and dangerous activity, including arson, rioting, looting, and damaging public and private property\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The US attorney\u2019s office and the FBI in Minneapolis said earlier on Thursday they were conducting \u201ca robust criminal investigation\u201d</strong> into the death and making the case a priority. The FBI is also investigating, focusing on whether Floyd\u2019s civil rights were violated.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T07:01:07.860Z\">at 8.01am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed0b0908f0898700351e5e2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T06:50:08.046Z\">7.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Frey faced questions about the apparent absence of police and the National Guard on the city\u2019s streets.

Louisville, Kentucky, as protesters turned out to demand justice for <strong>Breonna Taylor</strong>, a black woman fatally shot by police in her home in March.</p> \n  <p>It comes amid demonstrations across the country following the death of a black man, <strong>George Floyd</strong>, in Minneapolis police custody.</p> \n  <p><strong>Louisville Metro Police</strong> confirmed in a statement early Friday that there were at least seven shooting victims, at least one of whom is in critical condition. The statement said there were some arrests, but police didn\u2019t provide a number. Police had initially confirmed reports of gunfire around 11:30 p.m.</p> \n  <p>Police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington told The Associated Press that all seven were civilians. Around 500 to 600 demonstrators marched through the Kentucky city\u2019s downtown streets on Thursday night, the Courier Journal reported. </p> \n  <p>Understandably, emotions are high, Louisville Mayor <strong>Greg Fischer</strong> tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor\u2019s mother. </p> \n  <p>Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home.</p> \n  <p>Attention on Taylor\u2019s death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of <strong>Ahmaud Arbery</strong> in a Georgia neighborhood in February. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed09c758f084e882655acf5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T05:24:53.075Z\">6.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As the US grapples with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-minnesota-governor-national-guard-protests\">third night of protests</a> over the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, here is what we know so far:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-protests-what-we-know-so-far\">George Floyd protests: what we know so far</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed09aed8f087e3ca0f65835\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T05:22:38.991Z\">6.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85e45214b5100392da2ba230044752fa9fa6a972\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85e45214b5100392da2ba230044752fa9fa6a972/0_182_4946_2967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unrest continues over the death of George Floyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unrest continues over the death of George Floyd</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Maturen/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aedf20a97152427c41e1f15d458c41885aa4cb1a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aedf20a97152427c41e1f15d458c41885aa4cb1a/0_322_4895_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters look at a burning liquor store across the street from the Minneapolis Police Department 3rd Precinct during protests over the arrest of George Floyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters look at a burning liquor store across the street from the Minneapolis Police Department 3rd Precinct during protests over the arrest of George Floyd</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4afc770b9a3c05f099855d9771caadf6eeaa455\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4afc770b9a3c05f099855d9771caadf6eeaa455/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather around after setting fire to the entrance of a police station as demonstrations continue in Minneapolis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather around after setting fire to the entrance of a police station as demonstrations continue in Minneapolis</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barr\u00eda/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed099698f084e882655acec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T05:11:54.922Z\">6.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Minneapolis mayor <strong>Jacob Frey</strong>: \u201cWe all need to work together to ensure the safety of our friends, family, and Minneapolis residents.

I\u2019d assumed they wouldn\u2019t do anything to me because I was press and I had a camera in my arms, but I found out that I was wrong.\u201d</p> \n<p>The footage shows the toxic spray hitting the camera lens; simultaneously you hear Frierson utter visceral groans of pain as he stumbles and falls to the ground. Within moments he was dragged by protesters to the curbside.</p> \n<p>One of the extraordinary aspects of his footage is that it not only captures the enduring pain of being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/police-violence-protests-us-george-floyd\">assaulted by police</a> \u2013 Frierson is unable to see or move for more than 10 minutes \u2013 but it also depicts the swift aid that was extended to him by protesters acting as volunteer paramedics.</p> \n<p>\u201cI could not see a single thing. I had no idea where I was or what was going on, I was so disoriented and confused,\u201d Frierson said.</p> \n<p>\u201cSuddenly, people jumped in to give me assistance. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve never seen before in any protest. In the moment, it made me feel safe, I was being taken care of.</p> \n<p>\u201cFrom the footage, you can see they were all white people, and that means a lot to me. From the perspective of a black man who has just been maced, here were white people, in a society where white people have all the power, wanting to help me.\u201d</p> \n<p>Frierson is a rising star of the documentary film world. His <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11817822/\">movie</a>, Don\u2019t Try to Understand: A Year in the Life of Earl \u201cDMX\u201d Simmons, which follows the rapper DMX after his release from federal prison, was set to <a href=\"https://www.tribecafilm.com/films/don-t-try-to-understand-a-year-in-the-life-of-earl-dmx-simmons-2020\">open the Tribeca film festival</a> before the pandemic intervened.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/teargas-coronavirus-george-floyd-protests\">Teargas and pepper spray will accelerate spread of Covid-19, doctors warn</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Now he is bringing his acute documentarian eye to the George Floyd protests. Another exceptional aspect of his footage, shown here by the Guardian for the first time, is that having recovered from the trauma of being pepper-sprayed, Frierson decided to go back to the same spot on Flatbush Avenue and talk to police officers about what they were doing.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have no animosity towards the cops who sprayed me,\u201d he explained. \u201cI know there\u2019s a systemic problem in policing in the United States and that these guys are workers \u2013 you sign up for the police force, maybe thinking you are going to help your community, and you find the good ol\u2019 boys prevent you from doing the good work you intended to do.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50df4790fd53e6d850dc63b8c92dabdcf33c6ef1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50df4790fd53e6d850dc63b8c92dabdcf33c6ef1/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two nights after being pepper-sprayed Frierson returns to the spot to speak to police officers there.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two nights after being pepper-sprayed Frierson returns to the spot to speak to police officers there</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Frierson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A couple of nights after he was pepper-sprayed he spotted a group of police officers in the exact same spot and started talking to them. \u201cWe had a fruitful conversation,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>One of the officers was a black woman wearing a riot helmet and face mask. Asked what she thought about the policing of the protests in New York, she said: \u201cWe are not all the same, just as you all are not all criminals and perps.\u201d</p> \n<p>The female police officer asked Frierson whether he had encouraged any of the 18-year-old protesters to register to vote. \u201cThat\u2019s where change begins,\u201d she said to him.</p> \n<p>Despite his ordeal, Frierson continues to be positive about the upheaval sweeping America in the anti-police brutality protests. \u201cI think what\u2019s really beautiful right now is that people are recognizing that our government has launched an assault on the truth.</p> \n<p>\u201cDown the block from me right now there are a thousand white people in the street yelling: \u2018Truth and justice!\u2019.

But the historic George Floyd protest movement has underlined that political, civil, social and economic rights are intertwined not separate, and that these structural and systemic conditions reflect [a person\u2019s] vulnerability.\u201d</p> <p>Last year, American police officers killed 1,098 people, according to the <a href=\"https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/\">mapping police violence project.</a></p> <p>Black people are three times more likely to be killed than whites by police in the US, despite being 1.3 times less likely to be armed. In addition, only 1% of police killings between 2013 and 2019 resulted in officers being charged with a crime.</p> <p>Callamard said: \u201cAs an international human rights expert this is such a learning moment because it lays bare the necessity of moving beyond narrow definitions, and technicalities of police reform, as they won\u2019t be sufficient for meaningful systemic change.\u201d</p> <p>In response, the UN human rights council, which the US left two years ago, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/15/877299937/u-n-human-rights-council-to-hold-urgent-debate-on-police-brutality-racism\">will today hold an urgent debate</a> on racism, police brutality and the violent crackdown on peaceful protests.</p> <p>After watching the mobile phone video footage of Floyd\u2019s death, Callamard\u2019s initial reaction was \u201cnot again\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat stood out was how long the officer knelt on his neck and his indifference, but that was all that stood out. I am horrified because we are watching people dying in public at the hands of those who are supposed to protect us,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s death has triggered worldwide condemnation and protests against police brutality and racism, but this has failed to prevent more killings.</p> <p>Last Friday, Rayshard Brooks, a 27-year-old black man, was fatally shot twice in the back by an officer in Atlanta, after he appeared to grab a police Taser and run away having been woken while sleeping in his car in a Wendy\u2019s carpark.</p> <p>\u201cEvery aspect of this case makes my stomach turn,\u201d said Callamard, who said she had identified multiple possible violations after watching the video footage repeatedly. \u201cMr Brooks was asleep, he had not committed a crime per se, why did they need to arrest him? He was running away and the Taser could not be described as posing a threat. Why did the officer not run after him, or pick him up later, why did he get his gun out? Nothing about this makes any sense from a policing standpoint.\u201d</p> <p>Brooks\u2019s death has been declared a homicide by the medical examiner, but the police officer involved has yet to be arrested.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s another arbitrary killing for which the state and police officer is responsible, which reveals yet again the systemic nature of the problem,\u201d said Callamard.</p> <p>Callamard has requested authorization to conduct a fact-finding mission to the US, which she hopes will take place in early 2021, that would focus on unpacking the root causes and systematic forces in the death penalty and police killings.</p> <p>If authorized, it would be the first visit since 2008 and the UN team will seek testimonies from the families of victims like Floyd, Brooks and Breonna Taylor, and also visit towns and cities where meaningful reforms have been attempted.</p> <p>Callamard identifies two structural issues as key to understanding the shocking situation in the US. The \u201creasonable force\u201d test applied by US police to justify the use of force including lethal force, which is much lower than the international threshold of \u201cnecessary and proportionate\u201d use of force, and qualified impunity, which protects police officers from lawsuits.</p> <p>\u201cThe US should establish an independent prosecution body in cases of police violence. This wouldn\u2019t be a panacea but it would be an important step,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But, demands for the police to be defunded have grown in recent weeks, which Callamard argues must be taken seriously.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fearful that the political establishment in the US will fail to capture the radical demands of the protesters which deserve to be considered and reflected upon, so we do have meaningful changes,\u201d she said.</p>"

Both departures involved recruits who publicly expressed sentiments viewed as racist.</p> <p>In February, Andrew Sabisky, who described himself as a \u201csuperforecaster\u201d, stepped down from a role at Downing Street after it emerged that in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/17/andrew-sabisky-boris-johnsons-ex-adviser-in-his-own-words\">some of his previous writings on genetics</a> he had suggested that black people on average had lower IQs than white people.</p> <p>After Sabisky resigned, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/17/boris-johnson-adviser-quits-over-race-and-eugenics-writings\">suggesting he had been selectively quoted</a>, No 10 refused to answer questions about how he had been recruited and whether he had been properly vetted.</p> <p>Will O\u2019Shea, 57, posted the comment about Black Lives Matters protests on 5 July, at the time marches were being organised across Britain following the killing of George Floyd by police officers in the US.</p> <p>Responding to one person\u2019s tweet suggesting that Metropolitan police officers had been chased out of a housing estate in London by demonstrators, and another that called the police cowards, O\u2019Shea replied: \u201cTime to get out the live rounds.\u201d</p> <p>At the time, the Government Digital Service (GDS), the Cabinet Office department where O\u2019Shea was working, had already been beset by complaints from some black, Asian and minority ethnic staff that they had been subjected to systemic racism and bullying at work.</p> <p>Contacted by an undercover Guardian reporter posing as a recruitment agent, O\u2019Shea confirmed he had applied for a job in government through the Cummings recruitment advert, which was posted on his personal blog on 2 January. O\u2019Shea said he was interviewed in person by Ben Warner, another aide to the prime minister who works closely with Cummings.</p> <p>In subsequent emails, O\u2019Shea initially said \u201cI was let go because of my tweet\u201d but then said he was never given a reason for the abrupt termination of his Cabinet Office job.</p> <p>He accepted that former colleagues found his tweet was racist, incendiary, and offensive, and took him to mean that the police should shoot black people in London who were demonstrating.</p> <p>\u201cI can see how it was taken that way, and I am sorry for that,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. While he regretted sending the tweet, which he said was \u201cwrong\u201d, O\u2019Shea stressed he did not mean it seriously. He added: \u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2018shoot blacks\u2019 and that was not what I meant or wished.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Shea subsequently deleted his personal Twitter account, which he said was to \u201cget rid of any of the things I had said\u201d. </p> <p>Cummings\u2019 blogpost in January calling for \u201cweirdos and misfits\u201d focused on some of his key obsessions: harnessing of digital data by government, forecasting, and accusations of \u201cprofound problems\u201d in civil service decision-making. It was headlined: \u201cTwo hands are a lot \u2013 we\u2019re hiring data scientists, project managers, policy experts, assorted weirdos\u2026\u201d</p> <p>The areas of work for the \u201cunusual set of people\u201d the prime minister\u2019s adviser said he wanted to recruit included \u201cthe frontiers of the science of prediction\u201d, \u201cdata science, Alternative Intelligence and cognitive technologies\u201d and \u201cdecision-making institutions at the apex of government\u201d.</p> <p>In an apparently parallel process to normal civil service recruitment, aspiring recruits were invited to apply by sending in a CV and maximum one-page letter to a dedicated email address. </p> <p>O\u2019Shea did not meet Cummings, but said he was interviewed at Downing Street by Warner, a data scientist who is known to be close to the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser. He worked closely with Cummings on the Vote Leave Brexit campaign. After reportedly working on the 2019 Conservative election campaign, Warner was recruited by Cummings in December last year to work alongside him in No 10.</p> <p>O\u2019Shea said Warner interviewed him in the large room Downing Street where the daily televised Covid-19 press conferences were subsequently held. He said he was later approved to work on a No 10 project to reshape the government\u2019s use of data, which would involve breaking free of controls each departments has. </p> <p>\u201cSo basically they wanted to see how they could break governance rules,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The project was suspended when the Covid-19 pandemic struck, O\u2019Shea said, and Warner then told him he could get him a job in the Government Digital Service.</p> <p>He told the undercover reporter: \u201cBen Warner said \u2026 \u2018we can\u2019t hire you right now, but I\u2019ve got some friends in the Cabinet Office. They\u2019re looking for a similar set of skills, but it\u2019s not as long term.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In April, O\u2019Shea joined the GDS, the Cabinet Office department responsible for digital output, working on policy documents setting out standards for how other government departments can operate digitally.</p> <p>He is understood to have first caused concerns among black, Asian and minority ethnic colleagues with contributions he made to internal discussions about race, including one following an article published by the Daily Mirror on 5 July about alleged racial discrimination in Whitehall, which was headlined: \u201cWhite people 15 times more likely than black candidates to get civil service jobs.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Shea emphasised to the Guardian that he had not been racist in those discussions and had been asking white staff members not to criticise another white colleague too severely for their intervention. But he accepted that his contributions prompted some of his colleagues to look at his social media accounts.</p> <p>On his Twitter account, they were shocked and distressed to see his tweet of 5 July about the police and BLM demonstrators: \u201cTime to get out the live rounds.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, a government spokesperson said: \u201cWill O\u2019Shea was \u2026 employed by the Cabinet Office as an external contractor for the Government Digital Service on coronavirus. All standard vetting processes were carried out for a contractor role through a commercial framework.\u201d</p>"

It had form.</p> <p>What the BBC had no way of knowing was that its broadcast this weekend on Radio 3 would come at the end of almost three weeks of protests, statue-toppling and soul searching triggered by the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>.

First seen in 1840, it is an astonishing image of a broiling sea beneath swirling orange clouds, the sun casting a golden glow over the turbulence. In the watery distance a spindly ship rises at a precarious angle, while human hands emerge almost imperceptibly from the depths.</p> <p>Turner\u2019s original title was Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying, Typhoon Coming On. \u201cWhy does he make something so ugly beautiful?\u201d asks one of Pinnock\u2019s characters.</p> <p>The play takes a similarly swirling journey through the light and shade of black history. Central is Kiza Deen\u2019s Lou, a TV actor famed for futuristic voyages as the star of a US sci-fi series. She\u2019s been cast in a movie about Turner to celebrate the bicentenary of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/11/lets-end-delusion-britain-abolished-slavery\">Slave Trade Act of 1807</a>, but she discovers that the producers care more for the white abolitionists than the black slaves.

     "body": "<p>The word \u201cviolence\u201d is going to be used a lot to describe the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/30/protests-spread-across-us-in-response-to-george-floyd-killing-video\">events in US cities over the weekend</a> and all this week. So it\u2019s going to be important to be clear about who is violent and what violence is. Property destruction and harming human beings are profoundly different actions, and with a few exceptions (seemingly interlopers in the protests) virtually all the violence visited on human beings during this round of civil unrest across the US has been inflicted by police.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-who-was-he-his-friends-words\">An athlete, a father, a 'beautiful spirit': George Floyd in his friends' words</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This began with the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-who-was-he-his-friends-words\">George Floyd</a> in public in direct violation of what the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/knee-neck-george-floyd-death.html\">Minneapolis police department manual</a> says about chokeholds. He told officers he couldn\u2019t breathe and begged for his life. What is particularly stunning about the brutality of the police across the country is that they seem to expect impunity. They do not serve the public or keep the peace; they serve themselves.</p> <p>Nevertheless, much of the finger-wagging has been about property destruction, and it is dismaying to see that some are more upset about broken glass than public killing \u2013 or rather that they seem to believe society ought to<strong> </strong>rest on a foundation of stable property relations, not human rights and justice.</p> <p>The distinction between damaging or destroying human beings and inanimate objects matters. But it\u2019s not simple. People trapped inside a burning building break down the doors to escape; an estranged husband with a restraining order breaks down a door to further terrorise his ex-wife. The same actions mean different things in different situations. Martin Luther King famously called riots&nbsp;\u201cthe voice of the unheard\u201d \u2013 and as the outcry of people who have tried absolutely everything else for centuries, property damage means something very different from merely malicious or recreational destruction. When they riot, the black people most impacted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/09/years-life-lost-us-police-violence-people-of-color\">police brutality</a> and by four centuries of poverty, dehumanisation and deprivation of basic rights and equality, are more like people trapped inside that burning house trying to break out.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is no easy way to distinguish between ardent white supporters of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-donald-trump-white-house-washington-police-brutality-minneapolis-latest-news-updates\">black uprising</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_bloc\">black bloc-style</a> white people who revel in property destruction, taunting the police and escalating situations (before often slipping away before the police crack down). They are anti-authoritarians opposed to police brutality and the overreach of the state, and should not be confused with the rightwing authoritarians who many fear will use the pandemonium as cover for their own agenda, which could include creating more chaos.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa6592c49400aacb9c7f29fb84dfe37a5e2ac5a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa6592c49400aacb9c7f29fb84dfe37a5e2ac5a8/0_147_3995_2397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police surround protesters in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police surround protesters in Minneapolis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What these authoritarians and anti-authoritarians often have in common is an enthusiasm for violence for its own sake and a belief that it is revolutionary. Most successful recent revolutions have, in fact, been largely nonviolent, and those that were violent have tended more toward highly disciplined guerrillas in the mountains than window-smashers on the high street.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to note, of course, that property destruction can hurt the very constituencies that riots and uprisings are supposed to speak for. The loss of small minority-owned businesses, social centres and local amenities further impoverishes communities. Here, it\u2019s worth noting that I\u2019ve read accounts of residents of Minneapolis <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/alondrabikes/videos/10116080980577950/?hc_location=ufi\">trying to put out fires</a> and otherwise protect property in their own neighbourhoods, only to be attacked by police as they did so.</p> <p>A Minneapolis nursery school teacher told me that earlier this week: \u201cMy brothers-in-law in Minneapolis were participating in the hosing-down of an active fire in the lot next to their house (a bank). These were community members keeping the fire from reaching their homes.&nbsp;Fire and police were not on the scene until many hours later, being occupied elsewhere \u2026&nbsp;But the MPD police did stop by at one point in the middle of the night to throw teargas into the midst of the neighbours doing this work, and to shoot rubber bullets at&nbsp;the guys spraying the fire down.\u201d</p> <p>A dozen years ago, when I wrote a book about civil society response to urban disaster, I learned the term <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/04/elite_panic.html\">\u201celite panic\u201d</a>. It describes how the authorities often respond in an emergency \u2013 not by protecting and aiding the public but by seeking to control and repress us, protecting nothing but their own power and position. Police across the country seem to be doing this and more, demonstrating the same impunity the killers of George Floyd seemed to be counting upon.</p> <p>One of the stunning things about Saturday night\u2019s police riot was the direct and intentional <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/5/31/21276013/police-targeted-journalists-covering-george-floyd-protests\">violence against journalists</a> across the nation. Reporters have been arrested while working, thrown to the ground and pepper-sprayed, hit with rubber bullets and fired on while broadcasting. Photojournalist&nbsp;Linda Tirado is now <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/us/minneapolis-protests-press.html\">blind in one eye</a> after being shot by police. This is not only an assault on individuals but on the role of a free press in keeping the government accountable and the public informed.&nbsp;</p> <p>The story of activist violence is often used to justify police violence, but damage to property is not a justification for wholesale violence against children, passersby, journalists, protesters, or anyone at all. It is the police who should have lost their legitimacy, over and over, after the many individual killings from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video\">Eric Garner</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/apr/09/north-charleston-shooting-police-scanner-video\">Walter Scott</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a> to George Floyd. And after reckless, entitled, out-of-control violence in police riots like that on Saturday night. Perhaps the point of their action this week is that they don\u2019t need legitimacy, just power.</p> <p>There\u2019s one more kind of violence to talk about, and that\u2019s structural violence. That\u2019s the way that institutions and societies are organised to oppress a group of people, and for black Americans, that\u2019s included slavery, the long terrorism of Jim Crow and lynching, voter suppression from the 19th century to the present, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/23/black-americans-housing-crisis-sub-prime-loan\">redlining</a> (denying or charging more for necessary services) and subprime mortgages, discrimination in housing, education, and employment and far more.</p> <p>Right now, several forms of structural violence that particularly matter are the chronic stress and lack of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/04/racism-us-healthcare-coronavirus-african-americans\">access to healthcare</a>, housing issues, and work situations that have made black Americans die of Covid-19 at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/black-americans-death-rate-covid-19-coronavirus\">far higher rates</a> than other races.</p> <p>The autopsy report cited in the arrest warrant for the man charged with George Floyd\u2019s murder suggested his death was due to hypertension and a heart condition; it was, in fact, caused by police brutality and violation of civil rights, and his health issues, if true, might be just part of that same spectrum of structural violence. The police have been agents of this all along, and when they come out with teargas and clubs to suppress uprisings, they announce that this is who they are and who they want to be: violence in service of violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Rebecca Solnit&nbsp;is a Guardian US columnist</p>"

     "body": "<p>At the age of 17, William \u201cBootsy\u201d Collins packed up his homemade bass guitar and left home to tour the world with James Brown. He was heading off in pursuit of the funk. Or, as he calls it now \u2013 aged 68, in his high-pitched rasp down the phone from Cincinnati, Ohio \u2013 \u201cthe fonk\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the five decades since, Collins\u2019s bass has changed the shape of music. Not only did he play on some of Brown\u2019s best-known and most political records \u2013 Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine, Superbad and Soul Power \u2013 but he has also had a hand in pop hits from Deee-Lite\u2019s Groove Is in the Heart to Fatboy Slim\u2019s Weapon of Choice and Snoop Dogg\u2019s What\u2019s My Name (Snoop Dogg). After working with Brown, he would discover LSD, join George Clinton\u2019s Parliament-Funkadelic and help carry the torch for unapologetic bohemian black music after Jimi Hendrix\u2019s death. He found his signature style \u2013 star-shaped sunglasses, skin-tight leathers and top hats \u2013 and became an icon of afrofuturism. </p> <p>Born in 1951 in Cincinnati, Collins spent his childhood with his guitarist brother, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/14/catfish-collins-obituary\">Phelps, AKA \u201cCatfish\u201d</a>, and his mother \u2013 who worked several jobs to make ends meet. \u201cGrowing up, we were tough,\u201d Collins says. \u201cWe came up during the civil rights riots. We were street kids.\u201d</p> <p>On the day we speak, it is a week on from the horrifying police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. Protests are erupting throughout the US, and Donald Trump has called for aggressive policing. Having lived through the civil rights movement, does he feel this is a moment of reckoning for race in the US?&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cA lot has changed over the years,\u201d he says. \u201cWe [black people] have been allowed to gain more, maybe, in terms of money \u2013 but the wider mindset is the same. As far as who we are as people and a race and what we got to give, we haven\u2019t been allowed to advance that much.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d53197175def1615fdc644170a52d4a05e53d823\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d53197175def1615fdc644170a52d4a05e53d823/0_0_2048_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bootsy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bootsy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What has changed, he says, is the availability of images of police brutality. \u201cNow, everybody sees when these incidents happen. There\u2019s no secret, it\u2019s recorded, it\u2019s straight out into the world. We\u2019ve been through enough and we need to come together. I know it has been said for ever, but it feels like time really is running out now.\u201d</p> <p>In typical Collins fashion, his response to the global pandemics of Covid-19 and systemic racism comes in his own brand of galactic funk. Holed up in his ranch \u2013&nbsp;known as Bootzilla \u2013&nbsp;Collins has been spending the lockdown finalising his 10th solo album, The Power of the One. \u201cIt\u2019s been a strange time; really good for music, but bad in many other ways.\u201d While the album is not due until October, a charity single, Stars, was released last week, featuring a sample of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90G_QdxqqJs\">the academic Cornel West talking powerfully on CNN</a>, in the wake of Floyd\u2019s killing, about the ways the US has failed its black citizens. \u201cCovid gave me some time to reset,\u201d Collins says. \u201cI decided to put something out that was uplifting and that would hopefully help heal the planet.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYRP4B-SosU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HYRP4B-SosU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Listen to Stars, Collins\u2019s charity single.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Collins genuinely believes music has the power to heal. \u201cFunk just brings people together, from the ground up,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have nothing to do with colour. It has nothing to do with status. It just brings you to \u2018the one\u2019, and the one thing that we all have in common is that we all just want to live. That\u2019s what it\u2019s really all about. It\u2019s making something from nothing, like me.\u201d</p> <p>Growing up, Collins and his brother had \u201ctwo dollars a week between us\u201d, he says. Catfish, who was seven years Bootsy\u2019s senior, got a guitar first. \u201cI started off trying to emulate him by playing the guitar. I would hang out with him and his band, trying to see if they would let me join.\u201d One day, they needed a bassist. So he improvised. \u201cI took this guitar we had and just put bass strings on it and that was all it took \u2013&nbsp;I was a bass player.\u201d</p> <p>The pair started spending time at the local King Records studio, hoping to run into more prominent acts that might recruit them as a backing band. Their break came when a record executive, Charles Spurling, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G6jRsChXQ90C&amp;pg=PT183&amp;l#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">heard them play and enlisted them</a> as the band for blues and black country-and-western acts such as Bill Doggett, Hank Ballard and Arthur Prysock.</p> <p>It was when Brown heard them in 1969, though, that they struck gold. Brown had been recording at the King studios and was just entering his spangly cape-wearing \u201cgodfather of soul\u201d phase. \u201cWhen James Brown came along, suddenly we were living the big life. We got all the girls and we would get loaded,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat else could a kid want?\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Brown would provide much more than fame, women and drugs, however. While his own success was reaching frenzied levels internationally, he was also gaining notoriety for his domineering and overbearing presence. His previous backing band had walked out after disagreements over pay and he had started to fine members for lateness or mistakes. \u201cI never had a father and he took that role on. He did a good job. I needed that discipline. I would do any kind of wild thing otherwise.\u201d He was never fearful of Brown. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t intimidate us like the others because we were already tough.\u201d</p> <p>Over the course of 11 months spent with Brown as part of the backing band, the JBs, Collins rehearsed until his fingers bled, trying to hone in on the heartbeat of this nascent, stridently black genre of music. The group toured and recorded relentlessly, making a \u201chomecoming\u201d trip to Africa and visiting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/may/05/fela-kuti-10-best-songs\">Fela Kuti</a> in Nigeria, who afterwards kept up a friendly rivalry with Brown.</p> <p>As with any father-and-son relationship, though, the rebellious streak soon emerged in teenage Collins. \u201cJames would start accusing me of being high, even when I wasn\u2019t, so one day I just decided to drop acid to prove him right,\u201d he says. The consequences were, of course, disastrous. \u201cYou had to be so tight with his music, there was no way you could play it when you were high. He called me into the back room and I was out of my mind \u2013 my bass had turned into a snake \u2013 and he fired me, but I just couldn\u2019t stop laughing. I don\u2019t remember what happened with the rest of that night.\u201d</p> <p>It was 1970 and Collins was revelling in acid-fuelled hedonism; he told this newspaper in 2011 that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/14/bootsy-collins-funkadelic-funk\">he took LSD every day for two years</a>. It was during this time that he met Clinton, a singer and producer with a penchant for wearing nothing but a white sheet on stage and whose band performed a mutant kind of funk that swapped Brown\u2019s adrenaline-fuelled charge for a looser, more sexual lassitude. \u201cJames had taught me about the one [playing on the first beat of the bar, a Collins staple of funk bass] and he\u2019d made sure that we were in good shape, rehearsing all the time, dressing all the same way and recording everything in one take,\u201d Collins says. \u201cWhen I met George, though, we wanted to find our own identity. With him, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/dec/23/artsfeatures.georgeclinton\">you could just come as you are</a>. It was perfect, because he allowed us to experiment and he wasn\u2019t like a father figure. He was like: \u2018If you wanna get loaded in the back seat, go ahead!\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d942cb31b802dc4ec5d435d1bd00722cf6a7350\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d942cb31b802dc4ec5d435d1bd00722cf6a7350/0_0_2807_1940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parliament-Funkadelic in 1977 including George Clinton and Bootsy Collins.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"691\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parliament-Funkadelic in 1977 including George Clinton (back row right with beret to the side) and Bootsy Collins (second from right with hat on).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Being in Parliament-Funkadelic \u201cwas just total freedom\u201d, Collins says. \u201cIt was like being finally accepted. We could play whatever we wanted and fully express ourselves in whatever we wanted to wear, too. There were no walls between us and the sky, you could just keep reaching and reaching.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>There followed an intensely creative decade of work with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/23/george-clinton-born-lavatory-funk\">Clinton and his P-Funk collective</a>, with Collins part of Parliament-Funkadelic, as well as playing with his own Bootsy\u2019s Rubber Band and under the names Caspar the Funky Ghost and Bootzilla. He even landed a solo US No 1 with 1978\u2019s playful single Bootzilla. </p> <p>After Hendrix\u2019s death in 1970, Collins and Clinton were some of the few black musicians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2015/feb/04/george-clinton-a-life-in-music-in-pictures\">continuing his legacy, now with added theatrics</a>. While Hendrix may have torched his guitar in a state of devotional rapture at Monterey Pop festival, by 1976 Parliament-Funkadelic had built their own \u201cspaceship\u201d under the chaotic leadership of Dr Funkenstein \u2013&nbsp;one of Clinton\u2019s alter egos. The P-Funk Earth tour, in which the mothership landed on stage, was a carnival spectacle of celebratory blackness.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f562d9542157fe4ad571397e9b3ea884326192e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f562d9542157fe4ad571397e9b3ea884326192e9/0_0_2999_2406/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Clinton as Dr Funkenstein descends from the mothership at a Parliament-Funkadelic show in Los Angeles in 1977.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"802\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Clinton as Dr Funkenstein descends from the mothership at a Parliament-Funkadelic show in Los Angeles in 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen we brought the spaceship down to the stage, it was like a religious revival,\u201d Collins says. \u201cWe realised we were a part of a bigger thing, a larger expression of community. When the mothership would come down, there was this rapture; it was like the first time you made love and you would never forget it.\u201d It was a new vision of audience communion, something akin to the hippy love-ins of the previous decade.</p> <p>But the party couldn\u2019t last. \u201cI was losing touch with myself and it was hard to separate the Bootsy on stage from the person I was beneath the outfits,\u201d Collins says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in a very good place and I realised I was in too deep.\u201d With <a href=\"https://moversmakers.org/2018/12/11/patti-collins-finds-her-own-rhythm-in-giving-back/\">help from his partner, Patti,</a> he got sober in the mid-80s. Collins married Patti in 1996 and she now helps him run <a href=\"https://bootsycollinsfoundation.org/\">the Bootsy Collins Foundation</a>, a charitable organisation for children\u2019s musical education.</p> <p>By the time he returned to music in 1988, with the electrofunk record What\u2019s Bootsy Doin\u2019?, hip-hop was in the ascendant. It was a genre predicated on the sampling of P-Funk and Brown. That same year, NWA released their debut album, Straight Outta Compton. Dr Dre of NWA was so indebted to the P-Funk sound that he would call his later work G-funk. In a matter of a few years, Collins had morphed from the young, prodigal tearaway of a tumultuous funk orgy into an elder statesman of a revered genre; a superhero of the bass.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/26/george-clinton-interview\">George Clinton: 'Even now the music scares us sometimes' - a classic interview from the vaults</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Today, it is this legacy on which he is focused. This summer, Collins will restart his online Funk University, providing tutorials and lessons for aspiring musicians. \u201cWe have to nurture the talent that we have now, as it\u2019s just so much more difficult for them to get noticed,\u201d he says. \u201cThe funk is in the power of the one and so we have to work together to spread that message. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in.\u201d</p> <p>It might seem trite or overly optimistic for Collins to be so focused on a blanket message of unity while race relations in the US feel on the verge of an irrevocable and violent rift. Yet hope has seen him through other dark times, such as the trauma of the late 60s. &nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cPeople are so status-obsessed and they just don\u2019t realise that we are all the same, that this whole Earth is our mothership and we\u2019re all on board,\u201d he says softly. \u201cYou can laugh if you want to, because I\u2019ve been laughed at before, but none of that means anything to me any more. What means something is that we all get a chance to get heard and that we help each other out.

But law enforcement gets the lion\u2019s share of any city budget in the country,\u201d says Fernando Rej\u00f3n, the director of the Urban Peace Institute, a not-for-profit organization that trains violence interventionists. \u201cFor a [violence reduction] strategy to work, law enforcement needs to be able to do their work, intervene and provide alternatives, but there also has to be community investment.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018A racial injustice\u2019</h2> <p>Gun violence in America is still highly geographically concentrated and disproportionately affects black and Latino communities in city neighborhoods. African Americans make up more than half of all homicide victims in America, according to the report. Black men comprise less than 7% of the US population, but 51% of gun homicide victims. In 2016, homicide was responsible for more deaths among black men between the ages of 15 and 24 than every other cause of death combined.</p> <p>More than half of homicides of black Americans don\u2019t lead to an arrest, the report notes, and nearly three-quarters of all unsolved murders in these cities have involved a victim who was black.</p> <p>\u201cWe hear about disproportionate impact and it\u2019s important to speak clearly about how that\u2019s a racial injustice,\u201d says Ari Freilich, a lead author of the report and policy director at Giffords. \u201cThat number would be unheard of in every high-income country in the world.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Law enforcement are inheritors of a history of racism and violence. And police are frequently tasked with implementing and enforcing racist laws</p> <footer> <cite>Ari Freilich</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most homicides are perpetrated by a very small percentage of the population, often known to law enforcement. Street groups involved in violence constitute on average less than 0.6% of a city\u2019s population, with an even smaller percentage of that group actually perpetrating violent crimes.</p> <p>And yet in communities across the country, including some of those hardest hit by gun violence, researchers documented a concerning combination of distrust in law enforcement, underreporting of crimes, declines in witness cooperation and engagement with officers, less informed policing, unsolved murders and spikes in violence.</p> <p>Instead of acknowledging this complicated phenomenon, many departments uphold myths of cities described as \u201cmurder capitals\u201d, where residents are accused of being complacent about gun violence and unwilling to help police hold shooters accountable.</p> <p>\u201cSo much of what isn\u2019t working about traditional policing is built on myths and leads to policies that treat whole communities as part of the problem rather than victims, witnesses and the solution to violence,\u201d says Freilich.</p> <p>\u201cLaw enforcement are inheritors of a history of racism and violence,\u201d Freilich adds. \u201cAnd police are frequently tasked with implementing and enforcing racist laws.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen you are thinking of an entire community as violent you flood neighborhoods with all kinds of enforcement,\u201d says Jesse Jannetta, a senior policy fellow at the Urban Institute.</p> <p>\u201cRather, if you can identify a small number who are at an elevated risk of shooting and being shot it opens up a number of intervention possibilities.\u201d</p> <h2>Violence prevention</h2> <p>The report also puts local knowledge and experiences on a national stage, highlighting examples of cities with successful collaborations between communities and law enforcement, as well as police departments that have made progress in confronting the history of racial violence that looms over departments.</p> <p>\u201cWe know a bunch of issues are real, it\u2019s our kids that are dying,\u201d says Reygan Cunningham, a senior partner with the California Partnership for Safe Communities, a not-for-profit that seeks to build collaborations between law enforcement and violence reduction groups. \u201cBut people don\u2019t hold official power. Putting this on a national platform forces officials to wrestle with this.\u201d</p> <p>In Oakland, California, gun homicides dropped 44% between 2007 and 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/jun/03/gun-violence-bay-area-drop-30-percent-why-investigation\">a Guardian analysis found.</a> The drop coincided with a rise in clearance rates for homicides, and with the growth of collaborations between local faith leaders and grassroots organizers who have pushed the police departments to adopt progressive policing practices.</p> <p>\u201cLaw enforcement became more effective,\u201d the Giffords report says of Oakland. \u201cHomicide solve rates rose from 29% in 2011 to over 70% six years later, suggesting that community trust and partnership were improving, too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cb60b63deb24bb6870e3ecff70d71925cd81ef1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb60b63deb24bb6870e3ecff70d71925cd81ef1e/0_460_4899_2940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oakland residents look at a memorial for victims of gun violence during a peace walk against violence on 14 June 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oakland residents look at a memorial for victims of gun violence during a peace walk against violence on 14 June 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Hussin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even though Oakland has made massive strides, gun violence remains a stubborn issue throughout the city.

Still I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll make the progress we want if police aren\u2019t a part of our agenda,\u201d says Vaughn Crandall, the co-director of the California Partnership for Safe Communities.</p> <p>\u201cI think depending solely on community efforts to solve your violence problems is unfair and unrealistic.\u201d</p> <p>Stockton, California, a small city located in the state\u2019s Central Valley, is one of the few Bay Area towns that saw an uptick in gun homicides between 2007 and 2017.</p> <p>Since then, the total number of homicides in the city has declined from <a href=\"http://ww1.stocktonca.gov/-/media/Stockton-Website/Departments/Police-Homepage/News-and-Information/UCR-Reports/PIO---Crime-Comparison-Dec-2017.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=81E955C2370278C3FC0829C3629BB48FA8915877\">55 </a>in 2017, <a href=\"http://ww1.stocktonca.gov/-/media/Stockton-Website/Departments/Police-Homepage/News-and-Information/UCR-Reports/PIO---Crime-Comparison-Dec-2018.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=8F93674F6EEB95A19CFC3635D9597A14EEA7CE96\"> to 33</a> in 2018.

That\u2019s often because the departments are located in smaller cities with tight budgets and can pay a lower salary to an officer who was terminated. \u201cThey are so strapped for cash, so they hire you,\u201d Goldman said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Cleveland officer who was fired after fatally shooting 12-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/29/tamir-rice-killed-by-white-americas-irrational-fear-black-boys\">Tamir Rice</a> in 2014 was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/us/timothy-loehmann-tamir-rice-shooting.html\">hired</a> by a small Ohio village police department four years later.

Other times, they aren\u2019t running thorough background checks, or they determine an officer\u2019s record would not be a liability, said Ben Grunwald, a Duke University law professor.</p> <p>In a study Grunwald co-authored last month for the <a href=\"https://www.yalelawjournal.org/article/the-wandering-officer\">Yale Law Journal</a>, he and another researcher found that an average of roughly 1,100 officers working in Florida each year have previously been fired. They tended to move to agencies with fewer resources and slightly larger communities of color. The fired officers were also twice as likely to be fired a second time compared to officers who have never been fired.&nbsp;</p> <p>The consequences of this rehiring are severe, said L Chris Stewart, a civil rights attorney based in Atlanta. \u201cIf you don\u2019t fear losing your job and you know you have all these different immunities that will protect you, you know you will get away with [misconduct].\u201d He said it was hard not to think of this dynamic when watching the video of the Minneapolis killing where the officer ignored Floyd\u2019s cries for help.&nbsp;</p> <p>An attorney for Chauvin did not respond to a request for comment, and the other officers could not be reached.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some advocates have pushed for a publicly accessible national database that documents officers\u2019 disciplinary histories, which could help prevent re-hirings that endanger the public. \u201cYou can look up what a doctor has done, what a realtor has done, what you and I have done as members of the public, but you have no way to look into the background of a person with a badge and a gun,\u201d said Pointer.</p> <p>Marc McCoy, whose brother <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/01/the-life-and-death-of-rapper-willie-mccoy-executed-by-police\">Willie McCoy was killed by police in Vallejo, California</a> last year, said it was hard when the family learned that the officers involved had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/21/willie-mccoy-police-shooting-taco-bell\">previously killed other civilians</a> and been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/07/vallejo-police-shooting-bike-ronell-foster-willie-mccoy\">subject of excessive force complaints</a>. \u201cThese laws that you think will lead to the officers\u2019 arrest are actually there to protect them,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p>"

I expect there are less than handful in the whole country\u201d</p> \n<p>Dan Hicks, a professor of archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum who has written about the removal of Colston, said Quinn had shown the \u201cpace and process\u201d that UK communities require \u201cif they are to transform the places they love, while keeping change in step with their values and wishes in this new fast-moving civil rights period\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cWho knows how long this statue will remain? For many that\u2019s not the point \u2013 the value of this intervention is to underline the growing momentum and urgency that\u2019s building around re-making as well as unmaking British cities\u2019 heritage, museums, and historic built environments as anti-racist places.\u201d</p> \n<p>The mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, tweeted that the people of the city will decide the plinth\u2019s future, and that, although he understands \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/marvinjrees/status/1283392832569475074?s=21\">people want expression</a>\u201d, the statue was put up without permission and will have to be removed.</p> \n<p>Price said he feels the Quinn piece could \u201covershadow any permanent sculpture\u201d, and therefore hinder \u201creal progress during a moment of activism that should have showcased a black artist\u2019s output, not that of a white cis man\u201d.</p>"
