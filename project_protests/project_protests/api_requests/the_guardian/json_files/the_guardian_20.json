     "body": "<p>The word \u201cviolence\u201d is going to be used a lot to describe the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/30/protests-spread-across-us-in-response-to-george-floyd-killing-video\">events in US cities over the weekend</a> and all this week. So it\u2019s going to be important to be clear about who is violent and what violence is. Property destruction and harming human beings are profoundly different actions, and with a few exceptions (seemingly interlopers in the protests) virtually all the violence visited on human beings during this round of civil unrest across the US has been inflicted by police.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-who-was-he-his-friends-words\">An athlete, a father, a 'beautiful spirit': George Floyd in his friends' words</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This began with the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-who-was-he-his-friends-words\">George Floyd</a> in public in direct violation of what the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/knee-neck-george-floyd-death.html\">Minneapolis police department manual</a> says about chokeholds. He told officers he couldn\u2019t breathe and begged for his life. What is particularly stunning about the brutality of the police across the country is that they seem to expect impunity. They do not serve the public or keep the peace; they serve themselves.</p> <p>Nevertheless, much of the finger-wagging has been about property destruction, and it is dismaying to see that some are more upset about broken glass than public killing \u2013 or rather that they seem to believe society ought to<strong> </strong>rest on a foundation of stable property relations, not human rights and justice.</p> <p>The distinction between damaging or destroying human beings and inanimate objects matters. But it\u2019s not simple. People trapped inside a burning building break down the doors to escape; an estranged husband with a restraining order breaks down a door to further terrorise his ex-wife. The same actions mean different things in different situations. Martin Luther King famously called riots&nbsp;\u201cthe voice of the unheard\u201d \u2013 and as the outcry of people who have tried absolutely everything else for centuries, property damage means something very different from merely malicious or recreational destruction. When they riot, the black people most impacted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/09/years-life-lost-us-police-violence-people-of-color\">police brutality</a> and by four centuries of poverty, dehumanisation and deprivation of basic rights and equality, are more like people trapped inside that burning house trying to break out.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is no easy way to distinguish between ardent white supporters of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-donald-trump-white-house-washington-police-brutality-minneapolis-latest-news-updates\">black uprising</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_bloc\">black bloc-style</a> white people who revel in property destruction, taunting the police and escalating situations (before often slipping away before the police crack down). They are anti-authoritarians opposed to police brutality and the overreach of the state, and should not be confused with the rightwing authoritarians who many fear will use the pandemonium as cover for their own agenda, which could include creating more chaos.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa6592c49400aacb9c7f29fb84dfe37a5e2ac5a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa6592c49400aacb9c7f29fb84dfe37a5e2ac5a8/0_147_3995_2397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police surround protesters in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police surround protesters in Minneapolis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What these authoritarians and anti-authoritarians often have in common is an enthusiasm for violence for its own sake and a belief that it is revolutionary. Most successful recent revolutions have, in fact, been largely nonviolent, and those that were violent have tended more toward highly disciplined guerrillas in the mountains than window-smashers on the high street.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to note, of course, that property destruction can hurt the very constituencies that riots and uprisings are supposed to speak for. The loss of small minority-owned businesses, social centres and local amenities further impoverishes communities. Here, it\u2019s worth noting that I\u2019ve read accounts of residents of Minneapolis <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/alondrabikes/videos/10116080980577950/?hc_location=ufi\">trying to put out fires</a> and otherwise protect property in their own neighbourhoods, only to be attacked by police as they did so.</p> <p>A Minneapolis nursery school teacher told me that earlier this week: \u201cMy brothers-in-law in Minneapolis were participating in the hosing-down of an active fire in the lot next to their house (a bank). These were community members keeping the fire from reaching their homes.&nbsp;Fire and police were not on the scene until many hours later, being occupied elsewhere \u2026&nbsp;But the MPD police did stop by at one point in the middle of the night to throw teargas into the midst of the neighbours doing this work, and to shoot rubber bullets at&nbsp;the guys spraying the fire down.\u201d</p> <p>A dozen years ago, when I wrote a book about civil society response to urban disaster, I learned the term <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/04/elite_panic.html\">\u201celite panic\u201d</a>. It describes how the authorities often respond in an emergency \u2013 not by protecting and aiding the public but by seeking to control and repress us, protecting nothing but their own power and position. Police across the country seem to be doing this and more, demonstrating the same impunity the killers of George Floyd seemed to be counting upon.</p> <p>One of the stunning things about Saturday night\u2019s police riot was the direct and intentional <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/5/31/21276013/police-targeted-journalists-covering-george-floyd-protests\">violence against journalists</a> across the nation. Reporters have been arrested while working, thrown to the ground and pepper-sprayed, hit with rubber bullets and fired on while broadcasting. Photojournalist&nbsp;Linda Tirado is now <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/us/minneapolis-protests-press.html\">blind in one eye</a> after being shot by police. This is not only an assault on individuals but on the role of a free press in keeping the government accountable and the public informed.&nbsp;</p> <p>The story of activist violence is often used to justify police violence, but damage to property is not a justification for wholesale violence against children, passersby, journalists, protesters, or anyone at all. It is the police who should have lost their legitimacy, over and over, after the many individual killings from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video\">Eric Garner</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/apr/09/north-charleston-shooting-police-scanner-video\">Walter Scott</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a> to George Floyd. And after reckless, entitled, out-of-control violence in police riots like that on Saturday night. Perhaps the point of their action this week is that they don\u2019t need legitimacy, just power.</p> <p>There\u2019s one more kind of violence to talk about, and that\u2019s structural violence. That\u2019s the way that institutions and societies are organised to oppress a group of people, and for black Americans, that\u2019s included slavery, the long terrorism of Jim Crow and lynching, voter suppression from the 19th century to the present, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/23/black-americans-housing-crisis-sub-prime-loan\">redlining</a> (denying or charging more for necessary services) and subprime mortgages, discrimination in housing, education, and employment and far more.</p> <p>Right now, several forms of structural violence that particularly matter are the chronic stress and lack of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/04/racism-us-healthcare-coronavirus-african-americans\">access to healthcare</a>, housing issues, and work situations that have made black Americans die of Covid-19 at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/black-americans-death-rate-covid-19-coronavirus\">far higher rates</a> than other races.</p> <p>The autopsy report cited in the arrest warrant for the man charged with George Floyd\u2019s murder suggested his death was due to hypertension and a heart condition; it was, in fact, caused by police brutality and violation of civil rights, and his health issues, if true, might be just part of that same spectrum of structural violence. The police have been agents of this all along, and when they come out with teargas and clubs to suppress uprisings, they announce that this is who they are and who they want to be: violence in service of violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Rebecca Solnit&nbsp;is a Guardian US columnist</p>"

But law enforcement gets the lion\u2019s share of any city budget in the country,\u201d says Fernando Rej\u00f3n, the director of the Urban Peace Institute, a not-for-profit organization that trains violence interventionists. \u201cFor a [violence reduction] strategy to work, law enforcement needs to be able to do their work, intervene and provide alternatives, but there also has to be community investment.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018A racial injustice\u2019</h2> <p>Gun violence in America is still highly geographically concentrated and disproportionately affects black and Latino communities in city neighborhoods. African Americans make up more than half of all homicide victims in America, according to the report. Black men comprise less than 7% of the US population, but 51% of gun homicide victims. In 2016, homicide was responsible for more deaths among black men between the ages of 15 and 24 than every other cause of death combined.</p> <p>More than half of homicides of black Americans don\u2019t lead to an arrest, the report notes, and nearly three-quarters of all unsolved murders in these cities have involved a victim who was black.</p> <p>\u201cWe hear about disproportionate impact and it\u2019s important to speak clearly about how that\u2019s a racial injustice,\u201d says Ari Freilich, a lead author of the report and policy director at Giffords. \u201cThat number would be unheard of in every high-income country in the world.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Law enforcement are inheritors of a history of racism and violence. And police are frequently tasked with implementing and enforcing racist laws</p> <footer> <cite>Ari Freilich</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Most homicides are perpetrated by a very small percentage of the population, often known to law enforcement. Street groups involved in violence constitute on average less than 0.6% of a city\u2019s population, with an even smaller percentage of that group actually perpetrating violent crimes.</p> <p>And yet in communities across the country, including some of those hardest hit by gun violence, researchers documented a concerning combination of distrust in law enforcement, underreporting of crimes, declines in witness cooperation and engagement with officers, less informed policing, unsolved murders and spikes in violence.</p> <p>Instead of acknowledging this complicated phenomenon, many departments uphold myths of cities described as \u201cmurder capitals\u201d, where residents are accused of being complacent about gun violence and unwilling to help police hold shooters accountable.</p> <p>\u201cSo much of what isn\u2019t working about traditional policing is built on myths and leads to policies that treat whole communities as part of the problem rather than victims, witnesses and the solution to violence,\u201d says Freilich.</p> <p>\u201cLaw enforcement are inheritors of a history of racism and violence,\u201d Freilich adds. \u201cAnd police are frequently tasked with implementing and enforcing racist laws.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen you are thinking of an entire community as violent you flood neighborhoods with all kinds of enforcement,\u201d says Jesse Jannetta, a senior policy fellow at the Urban Institute.</p> <p>\u201cRather, if you can identify a small number who are at an elevated risk of shooting and being shot it opens up a number of intervention possibilities.\u201d</p> <h2>Violence prevention</h2> <p>The report also puts local knowledge and experiences on a national stage, highlighting examples of cities with successful collaborations between communities and law enforcement, as well as police departments that have made progress in confronting the history of racial violence that looms over departments.</p> <p>\u201cWe know a bunch of issues are real, it\u2019s our kids that are dying,\u201d says Reygan Cunningham, a senior partner with the California Partnership for Safe Communities, a not-for-profit that seeks to build collaborations between law enforcement and violence reduction groups. \u201cBut people don\u2019t hold official power. Putting this on a national platform forces officials to wrestle with this.\u201d</p> <p>In Oakland, California, gun homicides dropped 44% between 2007 and 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/jun/03/gun-violence-bay-area-drop-30-percent-why-investigation\">a Guardian analysis found.</a> The drop coincided with a rise in clearance rates for homicides, and with the growth of collaborations between local faith leaders and grassroots organizers who have pushed the police departments to adopt progressive policing practices.</p> <p>\u201cLaw enforcement became more effective,\u201d the Giffords report says of Oakland. \u201cHomicide solve rates rose from 29% in 2011 to over 70% six years later, suggesting that community trust and partnership were improving, too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cb60b63deb24bb6870e3ecff70d71925cd81ef1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb60b63deb24bb6870e3ecff70d71925cd81ef1e/0_460_4899_2940/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oakland residents look at a memorial for victims of gun violence during a peace walk against violence on 14 June 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oakland residents look at a memorial for victims of gun violence during a peace walk against violence on 14 June 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Hussin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even though Oakland has made massive strides, gun violence remains a stubborn issue throughout the city. In 2019<a href=\"https://www.ktvu.com/news/oakland-sees-7-increase-in-violent-crime-for-2019\"> Oakland saw 74 murders</a> in 2019, significantly fewer than years before but a small uptick from the 67 homicides in 2018.</p> <p>While the role of law enforcement officials in violence prevention remains polarizing in some communities, many say that law enforcement participation is essential if the downward trend will be sustained.</p> <p>\u201cPolice action and inaction are a really big part of the problem. Still I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll make the progress we want if police aren\u2019t a part of our agenda,\u201d says Vaughn Crandall, the co-director of the California Partnership for Safe Communities.</p> <p>\u201cI think depending solely on community efforts to solve your violence problems is unfair and unrealistic.\u201d</p> <p>Stockton, California, a small city located in the state\u2019s Central Valley, is one of the few Bay Area towns that saw an uptick in gun homicides between 2007 and 2017.</p> <p>Since then, the total number of homicides in the city has declined from <a href=\"http://ww1.stocktonca.gov/-/media/Stockton-Website/Departments/Police-Homepage/News-and-Information/UCR-Reports/PIO---Crime-Comparison-Dec-2017.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=81E955C2370278C3FC0829C3629BB48FA8915877\">55 </a>in 2017, <a href=\"http://ww1.stocktonca.gov/-/media/Stockton-Website/Departments/Police-Homepage/News-and-Information/UCR-Reports/PIO---Crime-Comparison-Dec-2018.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=8F93674F6EEB95A19CFC3635D9597A14EEA7CE96\"> to 33</a> in 2018.

That\u2019s often because the departments are located in smaller cities with tight budgets and can pay a lower salary to an officer who was terminated. \u201cThey are so strapped for cash, so they hire you,\u201d Goldman said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Cleveland officer who was fired after fatally shooting 12-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/29/tamir-rice-killed-by-white-americas-irrational-fear-black-boys\">Tamir Rice</a> in 2014 was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/us/timothy-loehmann-tamir-rice-shooting.html\">hired</a> by a small Ohio village police department four years later. His new employer defended the decision, noting the officer was never charged.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/27/alton-sterling-shooting-two-police-officers-will-not-be-charged-with-any\">Louisiana officer who killed Alton Sterling</a> in 2016 as he was selling CDs outside a convenience store was eventually fired in 2018.

You took someone\u2019s life,\u201d Quinyetta McMillon, the mother of Sterling\u2019s son, said in an interview this week. The long process of trying to get justice \u201cimpacted us really badly \u2013&nbsp;emotionally, physically, mentally, it was draining\u201d, she said, adding that it was painful to think of the obstacles Floyd\u2019s family will face moving forward, even with the terminations.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a5ce8b3734aafee08da93b68a505060b1be8a35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a5ce8b3734aafee08da93b68a505060b1be8a35/0_88_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police in riot gear outside the third precinct during protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police in riot gear outside the third precinct during protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If fired officers were barred from serving as police, \u201cit would help save a lot of lives\u201d, McMillon said.</p> <p>Sometimes police chiefs unknowingly hire officers with misconduct histories because of <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-me-california-police-discipline-secret-20180815-story.html\">laws</a> that allow officers to keep disciplinary records secret. Other times, they aren\u2019t running thorough background checks, or they determine an officer\u2019s record would not be a liability, said Ben Grunwald, a Duke University law professor.</p> <p>In a study Grunwald co-authored last month for the <a href=\"https://www.yalelawjournal.org/article/the-wandering-officer\">Yale Law Journal</a>, he and another researcher found that an average of roughly 1,100 officers working in Florida each year have previously been fired. They tended to move to agencies with fewer resources and slightly larger communities of color. The fired officers were also twice as likely to be fired a second time compared to officers who have never been fired.&nbsp;</p> <p>The consequences of this rehiring are severe, said L Chris Stewart, a civil rights attorney based in Atlanta. \u201cIf you don\u2019t fear losing your job and you know you have all these different immunities that will protect you, you know you will get away with [misconduct].\u201d He said it was hard not to think of this dynamic when watching the video of the Minneapolis killing where the officer ignored Floyd\u2019s cries for help.&nbsp;</p> <p>An attorney for Chauvin did not respond to a request for comment, and the other officers could not be reached.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some advocates have pushed for a publicly accessible national database that documents officers\u2019 disciplinary histories, which could help prevent re-hirings that endanger the public. \u201cYou can look up what a doctor has done, what a realtor has done, what you and I have done as members of the public, but you have no way to look into the background of a person with a badge and a gun,\u201d said Pointer.</p> <p>Marc McCoy, whose brother <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/01/the-life-and-death-of-rapper-willie-mccoy-executed-by-police\">Willie McCoy was killed by police in Vallejo, California</a> last year, said it was hard when the family learned that the officers involved had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/21/willie-mccoy-police-shooting-taco-bell\">previously killed other civilians</a> and been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/07/vallejo-police-shooting-bike-ronell-foster-willie-mccoy\">subject of excessive force complaints</a>. \u201cThese laws that you think will lead to the officers\u2019 arrest are actually there to protect them,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p>"

     "body": "<p>The US literary establishment is in turmoil after a wave of resignations from the Poetry Foundation and the National Book Critics Circle over their responses to Black Lives Matter protests.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/\">Poetry Foundation</a>, established in 2003 after a multimillion dollar donation from the philanthropist Ruth Lilly, had been harshly criticised in a letter from almost 2,000 people, including the award-winning poet Ocean Vuong and many other writers, over its brief response to BLM on 3 June. The Poetry Foundation and Poetry magazine \u201cstand in solidarity with the black community, and denounce injustice and systemic racism\u201d, said the statement, and \u201cas an organisation we recognise that there is much work to be done\u201d.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf4u5Ns8Blz0gutuanOHF6I026Xi0dE9lT36HQtg5pDKeT5uQ/viewform\">an open letter from critics</a> called the statement \u201cvague\u201d and \u201cworse than the bare minimum\u201d, saying that the foundation had been asked for years to redistribute its \u201cenormous resources\u201d to marginalised artists.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the stakes, which equate to no less than genocide against black people, the watery vagaries of this statement are, ultimately, a violence. We demand that the Poetry Foundation and Poetry magazine do more and do better,\u201d said the letter, calling for the resignation of both the president and board of trustees chair, and for the \u201csignificantly greater allocation of financial resources toward work which is explicitly anti-racist in nature\u201d. Until the demands were met, the poets said, they would not be submitting any work to the magazine.</p> <p>Board chair Willard Bunn III initially <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/foundation/press/153853/a-message-to-our-community-contributors-5edc1d8999eef\">responded saying that </a>the organisation \u201chas a lot of work to do\u201d, and needed to reflect \u201cas an institution on how we can participate in and support the nationwide call for dismantling white supremacy\u201d. Both Bunn and president Henry Bienen <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/foundation/press/153859/announcement-of-leadership-changes?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social_media&amp;utm_campaign=features\">subsequently stepped down</a>. <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/books/ct-books-poetry-foundation-resignations-0610-20200610-275aaxe26fctbczxhdvx7jizg4-story.html\">The Chicago Tribune reported</a> that Bienen\u2019s statement to the board on his resignation said he had \u201clost respect for the staff who did not defend themselves or the foundation from attacks they knew to be false\u201d.</p> <p>The statement continued: \u201cPerhaps some of these attacks could have been headed off if I personally had allowed it to be said the Poetry Foundation was racist, complicit, or whatever else some people wanted. To do that would have dishonoured you, the board, me as president, and the foundation and its work.\u201d </p> <p>The uproar was echoed at the National Book Critics Circle, where board member Hope Wabuke resigned after posting an internal letter from \u201cone of the longest-sitting\u201d board members of the organisation. Wabuke had been helping to draft <a href=\"https://www.bookcritics.org/2020/06/11/6792/\">a statement in support of Black Lives Matter</a> which sees the NBCC admitting its \u201cculpability in this system of erasure of BIPOC voices in the cultural and intellectual conversation\u201d.<br><br>The letter writer, who was not identified by Wabuke but subsequently named online, said it was \u201cabsolute nonsense\u201d for the draft statement to suggest \u201cwhite gatekeeping stifles black voices\u201d in US publishing or that the industry operates \u201cwith the full benefits of white supremacy and institutional racism\u201d.<br><br>\u201cI do not admit any culpability,\u201d the letter continued. \u201cI do not see any erasure. I resent the idea that whites in the book publishing and literary world are an oppositional force that needs to be assigned to re-education camps \u2026 In my 40 years of literary and publishing life, I\u2019ve seen far more of white people helping black writers than of black people helping white writers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"81c564570e8acfc58ca537ea6b15493ffbc0bffa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81c564570e8acfc58ca537ea6b15493ffbc0bffa/0_45_1852_1852/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The writer and critic Hope Wabuke\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Our silence will not protect us\u2019 ... the writer and critic Hope Wabuke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/HopeWabuke/status/1271076878745505794\">Wabuke</a> wrote that she had been trying to get the NBCC to \u201cput out a simple statement that says Black Lives Matter and racism is bad for one week now\u201d, but that their tactic had been a series of denials, attacks and delays. \u201cI know that a narrative is now going to be created that by speaking up against the racism I experienced I am going to be painted as a bully. But \u2018our silence will not protect us\u2019, as Audre Lorde says,\u201d wrote Wabuke, who resigned from the board of the NBCC with immediate effect \u201cbecause racism\u201d.</p> <p>The organisation subsequently posted its full statement in support of Black Lives Matter, saying that Wabuke\u2019s work was \u201cessential\u201d in its creation, and \u201csalut[ing] her work and recognis[ing] her devotion\u201d to the NBCC.</p> <p>\u201cIn the course of our committee\u2019s discussion with the rest of the board, a board member responded to the statement with an email that many of us saw as racist,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.bookcritics.org/2020/06/11/6792/\">it said</a>. \u201cBefore a planned vote on the statement today, details from the board\u2019s internal discussion were released on social media, and some board members have announced their resignation.

But prior to the lifting of the curfew in Los Angeles county \u2013 and a lawsuit filed by the ACLU and Black Lives Matter Los Angeles \u2013 the sheriff had said that the curfew \u201cwill continue on a daily basis until the organized protests are gone\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that the curfews are being enacted in order to quell protest,\u201d the civil rights attorney Rachel Lederman told the Guardian.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A curfew is a\u00a0very drastic measure... Every citizen should be afraid of the precedent that this is setting</p> <footer> <cite>Shilpi\u00a0Agarwal, ACLU</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lederman was the attorney who led a lawsuit against San Francisco during one of the only other times in recent history that the city enacted a curfew \u2013 after the verdict in the Rodney King case was announced in 1992. In 1996, the ninth circuit <a href=\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1379847.html\">ruled</a> that \u201cthe law is clear that first amendment activity may not be banned simply because prior similar activity led to or involved instances of violence\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBanning or postponing legitimate expressive activity because other first amendment activity regarding the same subject has resulted in violence deprives citizens of their right to demonstrate in a timely and effective fashion,\u201d the ruling reads.</p> <p>San Francisco lifted its curfew on Thursday, though not before arresting a number of protesters, many of whom set out to purposely <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSA_SF/status/1267994837061521408?s=20\">defy it</a>. Lederman pointed out that before the 1992 curfew, the last one in San Francisco was in 1968, after Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated. But the city didn\u2019t impose a curfew following the mass outrage over the verdict in the killings of LGBTQ+ leader Harvey Milk and the mayor George Moscone, two white men, or when sports fans <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/giants/article/San-Francisco-gets-tough-on-Giants-rioters-3994746.php\">destroyed much of the city</a> and set a municipal bus on fire while celebrating the San Francisco Giants\u2019 2012 world series win. \u201cIt\u2019s targeted at black-led, anti-racist protests,\u201d Lederman said.</p> <p>What was particularly concerning, said Agarwal, was that many jurisdictions such as Palo Alto and San Mateo county had enacted a curfew but hadn\u2019t experienced any sort of vandalism or looting. \u201cCities across California were just leaping to enforce these very drastic measures based on what they were afraid might happen,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Agarwal said she was worried about the future implications of these curfews.</p> <p>\u201cA curfew is a&nbsp;very drastic measure that should be reserved for very extreme circumstances,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery citizen should be afraid of the precedent that this is setting.\u201d</p>"

His works in the city included money to sustain schools, almshouses and churches.</p> \n<p>Although Colston was born in the city in 1636, he never lived there as an adult. All his slave-trading was conducted out of the City of London.</p> \n<p>Colston&nbsp;grew up in a wealthy merchant family in Bristol and after going to school in London he established himself as a successful trader in textiles and wool.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">BLM protesters topple statue of Bristol slave trader Edward Colston</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In 1680 he joined the Royal African Company (RAC) company that had a monopoly on the west African slave trade. It was formally headed by the brother of King Charles II who later took the throne as James II.

He briefly served as a Tory MP for Bristol before dying in Mortlake, Surrey, in 1721. He is buried in All Saints Church in Bristol.</p> \n<p>His philanthropy has meant the Colston name permeates Bristol.

It was decided in 2018 to change the statue\u2019s plaque to include mention to his slave-trading activities but a final wording was never agreed.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://epigram.org.uk/2020/06/06/removal-edward-colston-statue-from-bristol-city-centre-online-petition/\">A petition that gathered thousands of signatures in the past week</a> said he had \u201cno place\u201d in the city.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhilst history shouldn\u2019t be forgotten, these people who benefited from the enslavement of individuals do not deserve the honour of a statue.

Earlier this week, in what could be seen as a fulfilment of the 60s social progress movements, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/11/kamala-harris-trailblazer-joe-biden-running-mate-vp\" title=\"\">Kamala Harris</a>, the California senator and daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, was selected as Joe Biden\u2019s vice-presidential pick \u2013 an echo that reverberated again with the political ticket\u2019s choice of campaign theme song: Curtis Mayfield\u2019s 1970 classic Move On Up.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nobody could understand that we were white and progressive, and that had terrible consequences</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Harris is not the first Black candidate to seek the Democratic presidential nomination.

     "body": "<p>A former police officer who argued she had a right to use lethal force when she killed an innocent man after mistakenly entering his apartment has been convicted of murder.</p> \n<p>Amber Guyger faces a lengthy prison sentence after a jury found her guilty of the murder of Botham Jean in Dallas on 6 September last year \u2013 a verdict Jean family attorneys hailed as a significant moment in the battle to hold police accountable.</p> \n<p>Guyger is white. Jean was black. Guyger is the first Dallas police department officer to be convicted of murder since the 1970s, the <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/courts/2019/10/01/amber-guyger-convicted-of-murder-for-killing-botham-jean-watch-the-sentencing-phase/\">Dallas Morning News reported</a>.</p> \n<p>Standing in a packed hallway outside the courtroom in Dallas, attorney Lee Merritt told reporters the ruling was \u201ca huge victory not only for the family of Botham Jean, but as his mother, Allison, told us a moment ago, this is a victory for black people in America\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cIt is a signal that the tide is going to change here, [that] police officers are going to be held accountable for their actions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Merritt said the community should not have had to wait \u201con pins and needles\u201d for the conviction of someone who killed a man who was \u201ccompletely non-aggressive, sitting at home eating a bowl of ice cream and someone barged into his home and shot him to death.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cThis should have been automatic, anticipated, expected, but it is extremely rare. From this day forward we are pushing so that it\u2019s not rare.\u201d</p> \n<p>The jury began deliberating on Monday afternoon and reached a verdict on Tuesday morning, with sentencing to follow. Guyger pleaded not guilty. In Texas, murder usually carries a sentence of five to 99 years in prison but Judge Tammy Kemp had allowed the jury to consider convicting the lesser charge of manslaughter.</p> \n<p>Jurors, however, decided that Guyger had committed murder.</p> \n<p>Ben Crump, a lawyer for the Jean family, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Maria_NBC5/status/1179066011477250048\">told NBC local news</a>, said: \u201cThank God. Finally America saw the humanity of an unarmed black man who was killed in an unjustifiable way and they returned a verdict that is befitting the criminal, cowardly act of this woman, killing Botham Jean in his own apartment.\u201d</p> \n<p>Crump added in a press conference: \u201cThis is a precedent now that will go forth across America for equal justice for everybody.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said the incident underscored the need for better police training and that the verdict was for \u201cso many unarmed black and brown human beings all across America\u201d who died in interactions with police.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3b33b91e57e560c3f7957ba32b4d83170417e39\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3b33b91e57e560c3f7957ba32b4d83170417e39/0_0_6592_3955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amber Guyger in court last week.

She claimed she mistakenly believed it was hers and thought he was an intruder.</p> \n<p>Kemp controversially allowed the jury to consider whether Guyger\u2019s conduct could be justified under Texas\u2019s so-called \u201ccastle doctrine\u201d. Expanded in 2007, it is comparable to \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws in other states and allows a civilian to use deadly force if he or she \u201creasonably believes \u2026 [it] is immediately necessary\u201d in certain circumstances, such as during a burglary.</p> \n<p>Though Jean was on his own property and Guyger the intruder, seemingly inverting the intent of the law, her attorneys argued she made a \u201cmistake of fact\u201d when she went to the wrong home, making her subsequent conduct reasonable. They said she was tired after a long day and many other residents had found themselves at the wrong unit in the past because signage was unclear and floors looked similar.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe made a series of horrible mistakes,\u201d Toby Shook, one of her attorneys, said. \u201cThe law recognises that mistakes can be made.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prosecutors said it was \u201cabsurd\u201d to believe the 31-year-old\u2019s \u201ccommando-style\u201d behaviour was reasonable, especially given her training as a police officer and status as a more than four-year veteran of the department.</p> \n<p>They noted that Guyger failed to retreat and call for back-up, questioned the veracity of her claim to have given Jean verbal commands before firing, and pointed out that after calling 911 she appeared to provide only limited medical assistance as Jean, who was from St Lucia, lay dying from a chest wound.</p> \n<p>Rather than feeling tired, prosecutors alleged, she was distracted because she had been \u201csexting\u201d a colleague. Jean had a bright red mat in front of his door that ought to have been impossible to miss.</p> \n<p>Guyger \u2013 who was fired by Dallas police \u2013 wept while testifying.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was scared this person inside my apartment was going to kill me,\u201d she said. \u201cI ask God for forgiveness and I hate myself every single day. I feel like a piece of crap.\u201d</p> \n<p>In closing statements, Jason Fine, a prosecutor, called most of her testimony \u201cgarbage\u201d. Fine said Jean did not act in a threatening manner, but started to stand up \u201clike a normal reasonable person who has somebody busting into his home, and before he can even get up he is shot dead in his own home.</p> \n<p>\u201cKilling this man was unnecessary and unreasonable from start to finish.\u201d</p> \n<p>Special <a href=\"http://www.klif.com/2019/09/28/increased-security-in-the-trial-of-former-dallas-police-officer-amber-guyger/\">security measures</a> were put in place during the trial. Jean\u2019s death sparked protests and demands for justice from activists who cited it as one of a long line of racially charged shootings by a police department that lacks accountability. Though she was off duty, Guyger was still in uniform and used her service weapon when she encountered Jean.</p> \n<p>Critics of the department have also claimed Guyger was given preferential treatment. It <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2019/09/24/police-treated-amber-guyger-special-on-night-of-shooting-prosecutor-argues/\">emerged during the trial </a>that the head of the Dallas Police Association told another officer to shut off an audio-visual recording system inside a patrol car so that he could have a private conversation with Guyger soon after the shooting.</p> \n<p>She still faces a civil lawsuit brought by Jean\u2019s family.</p>"

Will it ever stop?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe president is appalled by the \u2018defund the police\u2019 movement,\u201d the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, said on Monday. She compared it to past calls to abolish US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) ahead of the 2018 congressional midterms, which resulted in Democrats regaining control of the House.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable to hear this coming from today\u2019s Democrat party,\u201d she continued, declining to say whether the president supported any specific policing reforms.&nbsp;</p> <p>The effort to turn the national debate over racism and policing so that it works against Democrats comes as Trump continues to fall behind Biden in key battleground states, according to several recent polls, amid his incendiary response to the mass protests against police brutality and his widely criticized handling of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Though Democrats have vowed to curb the powers of the police, few support&nbsp;defunding police departments.<strong> </strong>On Monday, Biden distanced himself from the slogan while embracing the growing activism around reforms in policing and criminal justice.&nbsp;</p> <p>Biden \u201chears and shares the deep grief and frustration of those calling out for change\u201d and \u201csupports the urgent need for reform\u201d, a campaign spokesman, Andrew Bates, said in a statement on Monday. But he stated bluntly that Biden \u201cdoes not believe that police should be defunded\u201d.</p> <p>Bates said the former vice president, who on Monday met privately with the family of George Floyd in Houston, believes that coupling additional funding for \u201cpublic schools, summer programs, and mental health and substance abuse treatment\u201d with support for police departments would lead to improved outcomes.</p> <p>In stark contrast, Trump has implored law enforcement to \u201cdominate\u201d the streets where Americans were marching en masse against police brutality and racism.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cLAW &amp; ORDER, NOT DEFUND AND ABOLISH THE POLICE,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1269970808329437185\">tweeted</a> on Monday. \u201cThe Radical Left Democrats have gone Crazy!\u201d</p> <p>Later, at a roundtable with law enforcement officials at the White House, Trump declared: \u201cWe won\u2019t be defunding our police. There won\u2019t be dismantling of our police. There\u2019s not going to be any disbanding of our police.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>He conceded that the nation had witnessed \u201csome horrible things\u201d at the hands of police officers but insisted that virtually all \u2013&nbsp;\u201clet\u2019s go with 99%\u201d \u2013 of them&nbsp;are \u201cgreat, great people.\u201d</p> <p>Republicans sense an opportunity to portray Democrats as extremists eager to disband police departments, while driving a wedge between energized protesters and elected officials advocating for more incremental change.</p> <p>Yet many supporters of the campaign to defund the police say it isn\u2019t necessarily about dismantling police departments or stripping them entirely of funding. Rather they say it is an effort to address systemic problems in policing by radically re-prioritizing community budgets to divert funding from law enforcement to programs related to mental health, poverty and education.&nbsp;</p> <p>And as protests continue to swell in cities across the country, their political influence was apparent. On Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/minneapolis-city-council-police-department-dismantle\">a veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis City Council</a> pledged to dismantle the city\u2019s police department, promising to replace it with a new community-based system of public safety. Meanwhile, several major cities, including Los Angeles and New York, are already considering changes to their policing budgets while others are considering policy changes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Democrats on Monday forged ahead with a far-reaching plan to overhaul policing in America, called the Justice in Policing Act of 2020. The plan would make it easier to prosecute police misconduct when officers violate a citizen\u2019s civil rights, limit the transfer of military weaponry to state and local departments and put pressure on the justice department to address racial profiling and systemic racial bias in policing.</p> <p>Though the legislation has galvanized Democrats, it remains unclear if congressional Republicans will join the effort, particularly in the Senate.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing outlandish calls, defund the police. Abolish the police,\u201d McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor Monday that did not address the Democrats\u2019 proposal. \u201cI think you may want a police officer to arrest a criminal before you try to work through his feelings.\u201d</p>"

Many young people believe the quality and scope of black history covered in schools needs to be re-evaluated. We spoke to four of them.</p> <h2><strong>Yasmine Fosu</strong><strong>, 20, London</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9b50c45edade88a4873966c6efaa648b2c47421\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9b50c45edade88a4873966c6efaa648b2c47421/0_1729_4480_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yasmine Fosu.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Black history has to be taught because it\u2019s the responsibility and obligation of this country\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I appreciate that there is more attention on Black History Month this year, but black history has always been important and people have been fighting for it to be acknowledged for years. With more engagement this year, it\u2019s critical that there is change now.</p> <p>I also appreciate that Black History Month is necessary at the moment, but the ideal situation is that there wouldn\u2019t need to be one. This country has a collective history, and all the different races that have contributed to and participated in that history should be recognised and integrated in the education system.</p> <p>The way I was taught history in school made it seem as though non-white history was completely separate from collective British history, which I thought was really unacceptable. For example, I don\u2019t understand how we could spend two years of GCSE learning about the war and not once have any mention of Gurkha soldiers.</p> <p>My mum taught me about black history, but if you don\u2019t have a parent to plug the gaps that education should be filling and you\u2019re unable to seek out this information for yourself, I think it would make you feel marginalised and excluded. If what everyone\u2019s learning about doesn\u2019t include your community, how can you be expected to feel like you belong?</p> <p>Having said that, everyone needs to learn about black history, and not in a pointed way. It needs to not be tokenistic or patronising in its approach. Black history has to be taught because it\u2019s the responsibility and obligation of this country. It\u2019s not just for the benefit of black students, it\u2019s not about doing them a favour. It\u2019s just fulfilling the obligation of teaching well-rounded history.</p> <p>The lives lost and the freedom lost that went into the economic foundations of this country are not understood publicly. Today, people descended from those enslaved still haven\u2019t received the justice they deserve, while others continue to benefit from the foundations that slavery laid. The very least that could be done is to include the truth about where this country\u2019s wealth lies and to recognise the very valuable contributions that black people have made in a wide variety of fields.</p> <h2><strong>Mel Chilekwa</strong><strong>, 21, Nottingham</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40b46ca62e258cfeb195ed22ad1363baead4e3ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40b46ca62e258cfeb195ed22ad1363baead4e3ee/0_112_1200_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mel Chilekwa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We need to learn about minorities in business, law, medicine, journalism \u2013 every aspect of work\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mel Chilekwa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have mixed feelings about Black History Month. I do like the fact that we do it, because it\u2019s a time to celebrate people we most likely wouldn\u2019t have been taught about otherwise. Black history wasn\u2019t really talked about much in my school, though we did learn about slavery.</p> <p>However, there needs to be balance in what you\u2019re taught. It\u2019s really awful learning about what happened during slavery and it sort of ends there. They don\u2019t talk about all these black people who overcame their struggles, it\u2019s just about how much they were oppressed, which doesn\u2019t inspire confidence when you\u2019re young. It\u2019s not really motivating, because you don\u2019t hear about the other side of the story.</p> <p>My parents would tell me about black history or I would read things online, and there are so many people who have done really moving, groundbreaking things, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jun/12/nasa-hidden-figures-street-renamed-black-female-mathematicians\">the three black women who worked for Nasa</a>. We know all about the race to space but we never learned about them, and without them it literally wouldn\u2019t have happened. I didn\u2019t understand why we weren\u2019t learning this at school and why it wasn\u2019t integrated into the curriculum.</p> <p>They also need to talk about black people who led in their industries \u2013 CEOs, managers, surgeons \u2013 because they are there, we just don\u2019t hear about them. It would be so inspiring for young people wanting to go into certain fields and jobs if they could see that representation. Learning about people\u2019s experiences and how they got to where they are despite being from a minority is so important.</p> <p>Black history also needs to be integrated it into wider topics, not just in history and not just for one month. We need to learn about minorities in business, law, medicine, journalism , every aspect of work that students might want to get into. We need to see black excellence rather than just oppression all the time. The past is so important, but you need to also focus on the next generation and the world they are growing up in.</p> <h2><strong>Rebecca Tyler,</strong><strong> 19, Nottingham</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cda222127ff3df08859adb65347944cf155be82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cda222127ff3df08859adb65347944cf155be82/0_628_832_832/500.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Tyler, 19\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Britain has an issue with shifting focus and blame on to America\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Tyler</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When my school did Black History Month, it tended to focus on the common American figures like Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, and the American experience of segregation and slavery. And I used to think: \u201cBut that was in America, why is the UK trying to distance itself from the history and achievements of black people in this country?\u201d</p> <p>Looking back on the information I received, which was supposed to reflect my ancestors\u2019 past, it just was not good enough. I\u2019m actually kind of angry about it. Britain has an issue with shifting focus and blame on to America, and the emphasis needs to shift on to black British history. It isn\u2019t a tick-box exercise and the black British experience needs to be integrated throughout the curriculum.</p> <p>These kids are British. They want to know about someone who might have come from the same town as them, for example. It would be so exciting for them to think: \u201cSomeone I can relate to came from my town, and if they did this then so can I.\u201d Bringing everything closer to home really would help kids find an identity and show them that they can also achieve good things. Learning about black history can be upsetting, but it\u2019s necessary. It\u2019s about having an identify and having role models with similar backgrounds.</p> <p>My school was not diverse at all and I felt out of place anyway, but the atmosphere was almost a bit uncomfortable at times because kids would not understand why we were learning about black history. Whereas if it was ingrained into the curriculum it would become a normality. That is key at this stage \u2013 it should be normal to learn about everyone\u2019s culture and history.</p> <p>It needs to be an inclusive realisation of the awful things that have happened, but also a celebration. Black history is so beautiful. Against the odds so much has been achieved and that should be reflected in education, whether that is in art, music, fashion or even hairstyles. Black History Month for me now is more about finding what I connect with. It\u2019s about thinking: \u201cWhat are my goals in life? Let me find someone I can look up to.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Lexia Richardson</strong><strong>, 16, Abergavenny</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46234107e0273a0f615fb5c11001c6067c3cee86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46234107e0273a0f615fb5c11001c6067c3cee86/0_1656_4480_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lexia Richardson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Not one person in my class could tell you anything about black history\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My school never did Black History Month and they\u2019re not doing anything for it this year. There are still people who make comments like: \u201cWell, there\u2019s no White History Month\u201d, and some of the teachers don\u2019t even know Black History Month is in October. I wasn\u2019t even allowed to put up a board about black history. They said no because of Covid, which I thought was fair enough. But when I walk around the school people are putting up boards everywhere, so it really doesn\u2019t make sense to me.</p> <p>I learned nothing about black history in my five years at secondary school and if it weren\u2019t for my parents, I still wouldn\u2019t know anything. My parents taught me about knowledge of self, slavery, apartheid, black heroes, black kings and queens. My dad showed me Roots and Amistad. He told me about Stephen Lawrence and Mark Duggan.</p> <p>In school we cover near enough every historical period, and it\u2019s like they forget about it. It was like no one really cared, and being a black girl in a white school, I feel left out. I could tell you all about the world wars, but not one person in my class could tell you anything about black history, let alone black British history.</p> <p>We should be taught about things like the history of police brutality in the UK. People here see the news and think it\u2019s just happening in America, but it happens here too. And we should also be taught about black males and black females who have achieved great things and the struggle they had to go through.</p> <p>With everything that\u2019s happened this year, now more than ever we have to show that black lives do matter, that black history matters. I want the next generation of black children coming up to know that they\u2019re not the odd one out and that people do celebrate their history and their skin colour. Being black will always be a struggle, but you can achieve.</p>"

He questioned whether it would be a breach of rules around political messaging if players followed the example of Thuram, who went down on one knee after scoring for Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach against Hertha Berlin.</p> <p>The dilemma for the game\u2019s authorities is whether players are contravening regulations by protesting against Floyd\u2019s killing.

If you score a goal and take a knee could everyone do that? Not just the black players. The white players too \u2013 everyone.</p> <p>\u201cEvery player should do it. It should be teams doing it. You saw the Erling Haaland celebration after the first game back where all the Borussia Dortmund players did the social-distancing celebration. They could all take a knee. Racism\u2019s not about black players or brown fans. It\u2019s about all of us. Racism corrodes society and we\u2019re all hurt by it. Everyone should want to demonstrate their solidarity and disgust.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to encourage the players to protest if they want to but I would also like to encourage them to do it in a way that doesn\u2019t expose them to unnecessary sanction. If they could do that by taking a knee, well if every player did that it would be quite a powerful message.

The incident was captured on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2014/dec/04/i-cant-breathe-eric-garner-chokehold-death-video\">cellphone video that showed Garner</a> shouting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 11 times.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Regardless of how you came to your decision, you finally made a decision that should have been made five years ago</p> <footer> <cite>Emerald Snipes-Garner</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His final words became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement that protested around the US in the wake of Garner\u2019s death and the death of black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, a month later.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill, who served as a uniformed officer in the department for more than three decades, said he had watched the video of Garner\u2019s death a number of times and questioned how he would have behaved if he had been the responding officer. He criticized Garner\u2019s decision to resist arrest as well as Pantaleo\u2019s decision to use the banned chokehold.</p> <p>\u201cEvery time I watch that video I say to myself, as probably all of you do, to Mr Garner, \u2018Don\u2019t do it, comply.\u2019 Officer Pantaleo: \u2018Don\u2019t do it.\u2019 I say that about the decisions made by both officer Pantaleo and Mr Garner. But none of us can take back our decisions, most especially when they lead to the death of another human being.\u201d</p> <p>Last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/16/eric-garner-death-new-york-no-charges\">the US justice department declined to indict Pantaleo</a> on federal civil rights charges, meaning the former officer will face no criminal proceedings.</p> <p>In 2015 the Garner family <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/14/nyregion/eric-garner-case-is-settled-by-new-york-city-for-5-9-million.html\">settled a civil lawsuit</a> with the city for $5.9m after a grand jury on Staten Island declined to bring criminal charges.</p> <p>Family members have long been frustrated at the slowness of the internal NYPD process. Pantaleo remained employed, earning more than $100,000 a year.</p> <p>Speaking after the decision, Emerald Snipes-Garner, Garner\u2019s daughter, said the family would now pursue statewide legislation to make police chokeholds illegal, and would pursue a congressional investigation into why the US justice department did not pursue civil rights charges.</p> <p>\u201cFor Commissioner O\u2019Neill, I thank you for doing the right thing,\u201d Snipes-Garner said. \u201cI truly, and sincerely thank you for firing the officer. Regardless of how you came to your decision, you finally made a decision that should have been made five years ago.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday Fred Davie, chair of the New York City Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB), the independent body that brought the disciplinary prosecution against Pantaelo, said: \u201cThis process took entirely too long.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the tragic reality is that neither a verdict from a judge nor a decision by a police commissioner can reverse what happened on 17 July 2014. Officer Daniel Pantaleo\u2019s termination from the New York City police department does not make the death of Eric Garner any less harrowing. But it is heartening to know that some element of justice has been served.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the evidence the CCRB\u2019s prosecutors presented at trial, the police commissioner had no option but to dismiss Pantaleo from the department. While 17 July is and always will be a somber day for the city of New York, today we can rest assured that Daniel Pantaleo will never patrol our streets again.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Neill\u2019s decision instantly ignited further tension between the city\u2019s powerful police unions, which have lobbied for Pantaleo, and the city\u2019s executive, including New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio.</p> <p>Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association, said in a statement O\u2019Neill had \u201cchosen politics and his own self-interest over the police officers he claims to lead\u201d.</p> <p>Lynch advised his 23,000 NYPD members to \u201cproceed with the utmost caution in this new reality, in which they may be deemed \u2018reckless\u2019 just for doing their job\u201d.</p> <p>Although De Blasio has never publicly called for Pantaleo to lose his job the mayor, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said at a debate last month he wanted justice to be served.</p> <p>O\u2019Neill said his decision to fire the officer had been based on the recommendations from the trial, and not pressure from city hall. </p>"

Her claim that Hong Kong police have \u201ccarried out enforcement actions in strict accordance with the law\u201d is simply ludicrous.</p> <p>International and local media have documented numerous cases of police brutality that are in violation of <a href=\"https://www.police.gov.hk/ppp_en/11_useful_info/pgo.html\" title=\"\">Police General Orders</a> \u2013 citizens being pepper-sprayed in the face because they did not move fast enough; protesters being beaten ferociously on the head with batons when they were already immobilised; officers verbally abusing protesters. The list goes on.</p> <p>By refusing to address these incidents properly, Carrie Lam and the Hong Kong government are simply perpetuating the institutional violence that is driving Hong Kong to the ground. They may want to maintain the facade that they are still governing Hong Kong, but those of us who have lived under the terror of the Hong Kong police know that Hong Kong is a de facto police state.</p> <p>In another letter published with the one from Winky So, Koh-Ann Chu of Hong Kong claimed \u201cthe vast majority of the force are decent people doing their job to keep us safe\u201d. As someone who has witnessed the police firing teargas in an empty junction in my neighbourhood, yelling profanities and taunting residents without provocation, I beg to differ.</p> <p>Indeed, transportation was disrupted and streets were vandalised. But all of this would not have happened if Hong Kong police officers had not fired teargas and rubber bullets at unarmed protesters on 12 June, or let triads randomly attack citizens while shutting down police stations on 21 July, or attacked citizens at Prince Edward station on 31 August.<br><strong>Karen Yuen</strong><br><em>Hong Kong </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>"

     "body": "<p>Edinburgh council could repaint a controversial mural in a school assembly hall that features a golliwog following the worldwide Black Lives Matter protests.</p> \n<p>The council <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/17/edinburgh-council-refuses-golliwog-school-racism\">refused to remove the image at Wardie primary school</a> in the north of the city in 2013 after a parent complained to the police that it was racist and offensive. lt said the depiction was a historical artefact within a mural of significant artistic importance.</p> \n<p>The artist placed the figure in the central panel of a large Alice in Wonderland mural in 1936, even though Lewis Carroll\u2019s story makes no mention of a golliwog. The mural was restored intact in 2011 with a \u00a317,600 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.</p> \n<p>The city\u2019s education convener, Ian Perry, and the vice-convener, Alison Dickie, said the council accepted its original position that keeping it would prompt critical discussion of racism and past attitudes should be revisited.</p> \n<p>\u201cEdinburgh has historical features, including the Wardie primary school mural, which hide or reveal the city\u2019s involvement in the slave trade and other racist practices and attitudes,\u201d they said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the context of the Black Lives Matter movement, we will be reviewing this decision, listening to black and ethnic minority voices.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will work with the school community, young people, parents and staff \u2013 to critically examine the historical evidence around us, ensuring that black history and its role in our city are a core part of an inclusive curriculum. In this way, we will understand the wrongs of the past and dismantle their harmful and persistent legacy in present day racism and structural inequalities.\u201d</p> \n<p>Senior political figures said last week that the very low number of black and minority ethnic (BAME) teachers in Scottish schools was a cause of concern. The latest data shows only 2% of Scotland\u2019s teachers are BAME. Edinburgh has 31 BAME teachers in its primary schools out of 1,607 teaching staff.</p> \n<p>Prof Rowena Arshad, the co-director of the centre for education for racial equality in Scotland at Edinburgh University, said the Wardie mural was an anachronism and should be removed.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we want to talk about the golliwog in history, it belongs in the Museum of Childhood [in central Edinburgh], anti-racist teaching packs and television programmes, not a primary school,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The city is under pressure to remove or rename sites that honour people linked to slavery, particularly Henry Dundas, Lord Melville, who delayed the abolition of the UK\u2019s slave trade. A plaque setting out his role is to be placed under his monument in central Edinburgh.</p> \n<p>The golliwog is a fictional black character that dates back to the 19th century, when it appeared in children\u2019s books. It was also used in the marketing of Robertson\u2019s jam until the late 20th century, when the figure became increasingly controversial.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fad45d97-9b7c-4bfa-9fe2-a2668e846bd8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5qmDT3XTLPg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>"

     "body": "<p>Democrats in Congress have unveiled a sweeping new set of proposals aimed at reforming policing and transforming law enforcement across the country.</p> \n<p>The new legislation, called the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, comes during ongoing mass protests across the country in response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/george-floyd-protests-enter-third-week\">death of George Floyd while under police custody</a>, and is the most ambitious change to law enforcement sought by Congress in years.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe cannot settle for anything less than transformative structural change,\u201d said the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Congress, drawing on the nation\u2019s history of slavery.</p> \n<p>Before unveiling the package, House and Senate Democrats including Chuck Schumer, Congressman Jim Clyburn, Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester, Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Cory Booker, held a moment of silence at the Capitol\u2019s Emancipation Hall, reading the names of Floyd and others killed during police interactions.</p> \n<p>They wore kente cloths handed out by the Congressional Black Caucus and knelt for eight minutes and 46 seconds, now a symbol of police brutality and violence \u2013 it is the length of time prosecutors say Floyd was pinned under a white police officer\u2019s knee before he died.</p> \n<p>Representative Karen Bass, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, which is leading the effort, called it bold and transformative.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe world is witnessing the birth of a new movement in this country,\u201d Bass said.</p> \n<p>\u201cA profession where you have the power to kill should be a profession where you have highly trained officers that are accountable to the public,\u201d she added.</p> \n<p>The legislation would ban chokeholds by police, including the one used for Floyd, set up a national database for tracking police misconduct and would bar types of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">\u201cno-knock\u201d warrants</a>, according to an early draft.</p> \n<p>The bill also aims to make it easier to pursue legal damages when police violate civil rights, stop racial profiling and racial bias in policing, and limit the transfer of military hardware to police forces.</p> \n<p>However, the package stops short of fulfilling calls by leading activists to defund the police, a push to dismantle or reduce financial resources to police departments that has struck new intensity in the weeks of protests since Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>In Minnesota on Sunday, Minneapolis city council members voted to disband the police force there and rethink how it handles emergency response, with a focus on community and social services. </p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a first step. There is more to come,\u201d said Pelosi. \u201cOnce the House passes the Justice and Policing Act [Senate majority leader Mitch] McConnell will, hopefully, take it up. During the Congress, the president must not stand in the way of justice, the Congress and the country will not relent until this legislation is made into law.\u201d</p> \n<p>The presumed Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, who will visit Floyd\u2019s family in Houston, Texas, has backed a ban on chokeholds and other elements of the package. On Monday, his campaign issued a statement saying that though he \u201cshares the deep grief and frustration of those calling out for change\u201d he \u201cdoes not believe that police should be defunded\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, the bill\u2019s path to becoming law is likely to be precarious, and has to go through the Republican-controlled Senate. It is unclear if law enforcement and the powerful police unions will back any of the proposed changes or if congressional Republicans will join the effort.</p> \n<p>Throughout the press conference on Monday, the Democratic lawmakers vowed to fight for its passage \u2013 a subtle concession that the proposal may actually stall somewhere in the legislative process.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis has never been done before. At the federal level in the Senate Democrats are going to fight like hell to make this a reality,\u201d Schumer said. He added that \u201cnow we must collectively, all Americans, raise our voices and call on Leader McConnell, to put this reform bill on the floor of the Senate before July, to be debated and voted on\u201d.</p> \n<p>A far less controversial bill that would <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/politics/rand-paul-anti-lynching-bill-senate.html\">explicitly make lynching a federal crime</a> for the first time in US history stalled just last week.</p> \n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20200224/BILLS-116hr35-SUSv2.pdf\" title=\"\">Emmett Till Anti-lynching Act</a> is named&nbsp;after the 14-year-old black boy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/emmett-till-long-wait-for-justice\">who was tortured and killed in 1955 in Mississippi</a>, whose death helped spark the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Though the bill passed overwhelmingly in the Democrat-dominated House of Representatives earlier this year, one Republican senator has succeeded in blocking its path.</p> \n<p>Republicans responded to the bill by arguing&nbsp;it was a move to effectively defund police everywhere. The National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee both sent out statements saying Democrats wanted to defund police&nbsp;departments.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat once lived on the liberal fringe has now broken through in serious way,\u201d said the NRSC communications director, Jesse Hunt. \u201cSenate Democrats everywhere are going to have to answer to voters about how they plan to keep Americans safe while their party seeks to \u2018defund the police\u2019.\u201d<br><br></p> \n<p>Brad Parscale, Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign manager, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/parscale/status/1270021700718034944\">weighed in on Twitter</a>, claiming: \u201cDemocrats like Joe Biden want to defund the police.

     "standfirst": "<p>From Black Lives Matter to the south London modelling circuit, the tangled mess of real life provides plenty of raw material for YA fiction</p>",
     "body": "<p>Newspapers and novels \u2013 fact and fiction \u2013 are often seen as polar opposites. But as a writer of both, I have come to find that fiction and non-fiction are simply two sides of the same coin.</p> <p>My YA Nordic thriller, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/i-am-fugitive.html\">The Sharp Edge of a Snowflake</a>, was inspired by two of the biggest news stories of last year and the fearless women behind them. In 2018, the journalist Carole Cadwalladr revealed that a British company called Cambridge Analytica had harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent and used it to influence elections. Around the same time the #MeToo movement was gaining momentum. In 2018, the actor and activist Rose McGowan released her captivating book, Brave<em>,</em> in which she exposed the predatory misogyny within the film industry and told of how the most influential man in Hollywood sexually assaulted her.</p> <p>Reality is complicated. Working both as a novelist and a journalist, I often feel there is greater truth in fiction than facts. But how can fiction be truth?</p> <p>Writing fiction is like knitting. Reality is a tangled ball of yarn. It\u2019s a mess. Bringing order to the confused mess that is human existence and turning it into a story does not make it any less authentic, any less true. Our times are like a tangled ball of yarn. When you knit a sweater out of it, it is still yarn.</p> <p>Good fiction helps us make sense of the world around us while still enabling us to lose ourselves in the story. Below are my top 10 novels for young adults about current affairs.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hate-u-give-617406.html\">The Hate </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hate-u-give-617406.html\">U Give by Angie Thomas</a></strong></p> <p>A reassuring trivia for all aspiring writers: before Angie Thomas wrote The Hate U Give, she\u2019d written another book that was rejected by more than 150 agents. In 2017, Thomas\u2019s debut became a publishing sensation. It went straight into the bestseller chart and stayed there for a year. It\u2019s a powerful look at the Black Lives Matter movement. A mandatory read that should be on the syllabus of every school, everywhere.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/fated-9781408350669.html\">Fated by Teri Terry</a></strong></p> <p>We need to talk about Brexit \u2026 no, wait, don\u2019t stop reading. Years before the Brexit referendum, Teri Terry wrote the dystopian Slated trilogy, set in a world where the UK has left the European Union and closed its borders. A brutal government wipes clean the minds of young people suspected of crimes against the state. Now Terry is back with a brand-new prequel to the trilogy that is actually inspired by the real-life Brexit. In Fated, she explores how her fictional post-Brexit world came to be. It\u2019s eerie to see how life sometimes imitates art.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/casket-of-time-9781632062055.html\">The Casket of Time by Andri Sn\u00e6r Magnason</a></strong></p> <p>This book is a hybrid of sci-fi and fairytale. The world is in an economic crisis. But instead of facing it, people turn to a new invention. The TimeBox halts time for the person inside it. You don\u2019t like Mondays or the Trump era? Just skip right over them. But what happens when everyone just hides away in their TimeBoxes, burying their heads in the sand? Just like in real life, the problems keep piling up. And just like in real life, it\u2019s the young who come to the rescue (think climate change and Greta Thunberg). Rebecca Solnit described the book as \u201cthe love child of Chomsky and Lewis Carroll\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb3773424976f7d2fb911685a1fa5b9d0a41191b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb3773424976f7d2fb911685a1fa5b9d0a41191b/0_48_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meat Market\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juno Dawson, whose book Meat Market deals with the underbelly of the fashion industry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eivind Hansen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/meat-market-9781786540386.html\">Meat Market by Juno Dawson</a></strong></p> <p>Having worked on the fringes of the fashion industry as a journalist, Juno Dawson started to realise there was a problem. The models, often very young girls, nameless faces and bodies of the global fashion industry, were not always treated well by photographers, agents and designers. Meat Market tells the story of an ordinary girl from a south London estate who is thrust into the world of high fashion where she discovers the seedy underbelly of the beauty industry.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/good-girl-s-guide-to-murder-9781405293181.html\">A Good Girl\u2019s Guide to Murder by Holly Jackson</a></strong></p> <p>What is news? Well, how long is a piece of string? Is true crime news? I don\u2019t know. But it certainly has become a popular form of entertainment. We seem to have an unquenchable thirst for podcasts such as Serial and documentaries such as Making a Murderer. A Good Girl\u2019s Guide to Murder is a novel inspired by true crime. The format of the book mimics the form of the true crime shows we know and love; though the book isn\u2019t based on any one case, almost everything that happens is partly inspired by an actual crime.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/burial-rites-2.html\">Burial Rites by Hannah Kent</a></strong></p> <p>A young woman accused of murder is sent to a remote farm where she is to wait for her execution. The book is based on a true story, and I have a confession to make: I\u2019m a descendant of the man who beheaded her, Iceland\u2019s last executioner. In 1829, Agnes Magn\u00fasd\u00f3ttir and Fri\u00f0rik Sigur\u00f0sson were sentenced to death for the murder of Natan Ketilsson. When it came down to it no one wanted to do the beheading. My forefather, Gu\u00f0mundur Ketilsson, the brother of the murder victim, was persuaded to do it. It\u2019s a murder case that has captivated Icelanders for 200 years. Did they really do it? Why did they do it? Was Agnes really the evil temptress the courts made her out to be? It was the news story of the 18th century, and if they\u2019d had televisions back then, people would have been following the case on true crime specials over a bowl of popcorn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"afdb86eb535f53233622b321443a0540cf534e7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afdb86eb535f53233622b321443a0540cf534e7d/0_105_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A memorial plaque at the spot where Stephen Lawrence was murdered\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A memorial plaque at the spot where Stephen Lawrence was murdered \u2013 the tragic starting point for Malorie Blackman\u2019s Noughts &amp; Crosses series.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/crossfire-9780241388440.html\">Crossfire by Malorie Blackman</a></strong></p> <p>It\u2019s almost 20 years since the first book in the groundbreaking Noughts &amp; Crosses series was published. The series, which explores racism through alternative history and is set in a world where black people rule over white people, was inspired by the Stephen Lawrence murder case. This fifth book in the series, however, is influenced by the dystopian feel of our current political climate. \u201cThe results of the UK Brexit referendum and the US presidential election in 2016,\u201d Blackman writes in the preface to Crossfire, \u201cbrought home to me just how potent the politics of fear and division can be.\u201d</p> <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/american-wife.html\">American Wife by Curtis Sittenfeld</a></strong></p> <p>If it weren\u2019t for Donald Trump, we\u2019d still be gasping over what an awful president George W Bush turned out to be. American Wife is the literary reimagining of one man\u2019s journey to the White House seen through the eyes of his long-suffering wife \u2013 a woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to Laura Bush.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b089665b3194b5a3a8de1dea7f9523e0e1f9206\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b089665b3194b5a3a8de1dea7f9523e0e1f9206/88_276_2823_1694/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Refugees and migrants wait to be rescued from a boat in the Mediterranean\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Refugees and migrants wait to be rescued from a boat in the Mediterranean \u2013 a crisis dealt with in the graphic novel Illegal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/illegal-603474.html\">Illegal</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/illegal-603474.html\"> by Eoin Colfer, Andrew Donkin and Giovanni Rigano</a></strong></p> <p>Illegal is a thought-provoking graphic novel that explores the plight of immigrants embarking on perilous journeys in the hope of a better life. According to Donkin, the inspiration for Illegal was a newspaper article \u201cabout the size of a postage stamp\u201d that haunted him about a boat sinking in the Mediterranean with 215 people on board. \u201cEoin and I talked about it, and waited for the follow-up report with the names of the people lost, but no report ever came.\u201d</p> <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/oranges-in-no-man-s-land-369461.html\">Oranges in No Man\u2019s Land by Elizabeth Laird</a></strong></p> <p>A couple of months ago, the UN asked: \u201cIs the world becoming numb to the killing of children in Syria?\u201d Oranges in No Man\u2019s Land is set in Lebanon during the civil war. The book is based on Laird\u2019s personal story: she stayed on the green line in Beirut in 1977 in a war-damaged flat with her husband and six-month-old son, who slept in a suitcase on the floor and took his first steps on their bullet-riddled balcony. It\u2019s a touching book that reminds us that we\u2019re not allowed to shield ourselves with apathy when it comes to children and war.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Sharp Edge of a Snowflake by Sif Sigmarsd\u00f3ttir is published by Hodder.

Campaigners, in the teeth of resistance from those who argued that removing his name would be an erasure of history, have been attempting for years to get the sculpture removed \u2013 or at least relabelled so that his role in the slave trade could be better understood.</p> <p>Back in 2017, even the church that had held annual commemorations in Colston\u2019s honour for 300 years refused to do so; Colston Hall, the city\u2019s best-known music venue, plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/08/bristol-colston-hall-name-change-autumn-2020-bristol-music-trust\">announce a new name</a> this autumn.</p> <p>In the end, the force of history overturned his sculpture as much as the hands of protestors.</p> <p>Even Historic England, the body in charge of safeguarding listed monuments such as the Colston statue, and hardly a known force for radicalism, <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/whats-new/statements/edward-colston-statue/?fbclid=IwAR1y5cNoqOxG0ddsvXBiqBWk4G788GuWK7JXgFITsrOtRS1UXuEG-SnUL0o\">has said</a> it recognises \u201cthat the statue was a symbol of injustice and a source of great pain for many people\u201d, that the statue\u2019s future must be decided locally, and that it will not insist on its reinstatement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/boris-johnson-colston-statue\">The anger that felled Colston\u2019s statue cannot be eased by Boris Johnson | Hugh Muir</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now other campaigns around the UK are gathering new force in the wake of the recent anti-racism protests. Looming over Edinburgh\u2019s New Town, at the eastern end of the elegant George Street, stands a 46-metre column. Atop it stands, in the centre of St Andrew Square,&nbsp;in a heroic pose reminiscent of that of a Roman emperor, the figure of Henry Dundas, the first Viscount Melville.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dundas was home secretary, war secretary and the last figure to be impeached in Britain, in 1806, for the misappropriation of public funds. His name and that of other family members are sprinkled liberally through the Scottish capital \u2013 the grand, poker-straight Dundas Street runs north towards the Firth of Forth from the centre of George Street; the city has its Melville Street, Crescent, Terrace, Place and Drive.</p> <p>Sir Geoff Palmer, a professor emeritus of Heriot-Watt University, has been <a href=\"https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/people/edinburgh-professor-renews-call-reword-history-statue-memorialising-man-who-prolonged-slave-trade-2876774\">running a years-long campaign</a> for a new plaque on the base of the sculpture to explain Melville\u2019s role in slavery, since, as he put it in an <a href=\"https://www.thenational.scot/news/18501284.lessons-buried-countrys-shameful-past/?ref=twtrec\">article</a> for the National, \u201che delayed the abolition of the slave trade for 15 years (1792-1807), which caused the enslavement of about 630,000 Africans; and as war secretary lost about 40,000 British troops in Haiti fighting a pro-slavery war.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>In recent days, the name George Floyd has been written by protesters on the base of the sculpture, and a petition has been launched demanding the removal of the statue altogether. The petition also calls for the renaming of the Dundas and Melville streets in honour of Joseph Knight, an African-born man who was enslaved in Jamaica in the late 18th-century, then brought to Scotland by his master. He managed to free himself after a series of court cases in which he successfully argued that slavery did not exist in Scots law.</p> <p>In Glasgow, protesters have renamed a number of central-city streets whose official nomenclature celebrates grandees and notables enriched by slavery \u2013 especially by slave-worked tobacco plantations in Virginia and Maryland.&nbsp;</p> <p>Buchanan Street, the city\u2019s main shopping thoroughfare, is named for the 18th-century plantation owner Andrew Buchanan. At the weekend it was given a new sign calling it George Floyd Street.&nbsp;</p> <p>Cochrane Street \u2013 after Andrew Cochrane, another plantation owner and the Lord Provost of Glasgow \u2013 was given a sign naming it Sheku Bayoh Street, in commemoration of a black man who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/16/sheku-bayoh-brother-shouldnt-have-died-like-this-inquiry-family\">died in Fife in custody</a> in 2015, after being restrained by police.</p> <p>Recent events have also given fresh impetus to Oxford\u2019s Rhodes Must Fall campaign, which began in 2016. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/fall-of-bristols-colston-statue-revives-rhodes-campaign-in-oxford\">protest </a>is planned on Tuesday in front of Oriel College\u2019s sculpture of the imperialist, politician and entrepreneur Cecil Rhodes. A sign taped to a door on the city\u2019s High Street, near the statue, bore the words \u201cRhodes you\u2019re next\u201d \u2013 a reference to the toppling of the Colston sculpture.&nbsp;</p> <p>The meanings locked into Britain\u2019s urban fabric are being increasingly examined, decoded \u2013 and found wanting.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 July 2020 to clarify that not only the name of Henry Dundas, but also of other members of his family, feature across Edinburgh.</p>"

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/06/uk-anti-racism-protesters-defy-calls-to-avoid-mass-gatherings\">marches and protests that have swept the major cities</a> in recent days have not only been about George Floyd, the unarmed black man who died at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis on the Monday before last \u2013 or, more precisely, his left knee, when it was applied with remorseless force to the side of Floyd\u2019s neck during an arrest.</p> <p>This is not only about police brutality in the United States, however appalling that is, however grotesque the death toll, and it is not something that is just happening over there. This is about something on our shores and, indeed, everywhere else, deeply pernicious and to listen to Gray, the Watford striker who is preparing for a return to Premier League action the week after next, is to listen to a man trying to process a range of emotions, all of them uncomfortable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jun/05/open-letter-donald-trump-us-president-george-floyd-liam-rosenior\">This is just the beginning, I promise you: an open letter to Donald Trump | Liam Rosenior</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere are ignorant people that don\u2019t understand what we are marching and protesting about,\u201d Gray says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about George Floyd and the brutality that is going on in America. It is about what is going on in England and the rest of the world. I feel we are lucky we don\u2019t have armed police officers on the street because we are still stereotyped and judged by these police officers over here, just the same [as in the US].</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t even count how many times I\u2019ve been pulled over. I can\u2019t count how many times I\u2019ve gone to a club and not got in, how many times a security guard has followed me round a shop. I can\u2019t count how many times that somebody has asked me if I\u2019m a footballer because I\u2019ve come out of a nice car. Look, at the end of the day, I\u2019m three people in this country. And that\u2019s either a footballer, a rapper or a drug dealer.

It\u2019s because of the systematic racism that is everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Gray describes himself as \u201cangry, frustrated, disappointed\u201d as he considers Floyd\u2019s death. His tone is measured, even if it feels as though he might want to scream. But one of the shocking things is that he is not shocked at all.</p> <p>Gray is a student of black American history, the subject has fascinated him for some years and the story of how he has tattooed the entirety of his back with images of famous figures has been well told. In no particular order, there is Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, Marcus Garvey, Rosa Parks, Huey Newton, the Black Panthers, Muhammad Ali, Bob Marley, Tommie Smith and John Carlos. Gray knows how it was for previous generations of black people and a sense of resignation runs through his words.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c46a4b19822daccfde296e432ffeb59abda5971\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c46a4b19822daccfde296e432ffeb59abda5971/0_0_3930_2800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rosa Parks, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Bob Marley and Nelson Mandela tattooed on Andre Gray\u2019s back\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rosa Parks, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Bob Marley and Nelson Mandela are among the people tattooed on Andre Gray\u2019s back.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a shame it\u2019s taken so long for people to wake up and see this because it\u2019s been happening for how many years now?\u201d Gray says. \u201cFor over 400 years, so it\u2019s nothing new. For me, it\u2019s strange as to why this particular one [Floyd\u2019s death] has raised so much voice because we\u2019ve been watching videos like this for years and years and years.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something I\u2019m not used to seeing, which is pretty sad to say. It\u2019s maybe more disturbing for other people but for me and a lot of black people, it\u2019s become a normal thing to see.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the harsh reality of what our ancestors, our grandparents, our parents and now us have had to deal with. It\u2019s not just now and it frustrates me that people are speaking about it now because everyone knows the history of it all, everyone has been seeing what\u2019s been going on. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s just randomly happened. It\u2019s been going on for years. And it\u2019s not just the brutality of it, it\u2019s the systemic part of it, the institutionalised part of it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0884d810b10dba7e3fcc0d8fe38ce854d2eb414\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0884d810b10dba7e3fcc0d8fe38ce854d2eb414/0_90_3112_1988/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andre Gray celebrates scoring for Watford against Norwich in November.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andre Gray celebrates scoring for Watford against Norwich in November.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Toth/BPI/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gray has read the comments of other black footballers in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/03/mls-footballer-nedum-onuoha-fears-us-police-real-salt-lake-qpr-george-floyd\">Nedum Onuoha</a>, the former England Under-21s defender who plays for Real Salt Lake, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/02/newcastles-deandre-yedlin-feels-us-is-an-unsafe-place-for-a-young-black-man\">DeAndre Yedlin</a>, Newcastle\u2019s USA international, have said the States is not a safe place for young, black men.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been to America plenty of times and I feel exactly how they feel,\u201d Gray says. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling in the air. When I go to America, I\u2019m fortunate enough to stay in the nicer areas but the last time I went there \u2013 to New York last October, November \u2013 I went and explored. I went to the rough areas \u2013 to Brooklyn, Harlem, the Bronx; I walked around and you see it first-hand, what life is like out there.</p> <p>\u201cThe deeper you go into it [these areas], the more black people you start to see and you start to see the white people filter out. Even when you\u2019re on the train \u2026 every stop, you see the white people get off and then, by the time you get to these areas, the train is just full of black people. They are just left there. It\u2019s as if they have just completely segregated it. Actually, it\u2019s not as if. That\u2019s what they have done. It\u2019s a segregation.

It\u2019s all to do with immigration and the people that have voted to leave the EU \u2026 for me, it\u2019s because of racism, because they don\u2019t want people coming into our country. It frustrates me because if you see some of the places these people are coming from, these other countries, it [the situation there] is a lot worse and we are supposed to be a country of freedom, as is America. So that just proves to me how bad the racism is \u2013 because they\u2019ve had enough of immigrants. It\u2019s just a nail in the coffin.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Things have to change. It\u2019s at a point now where \u2026 what is it going to take?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What is there to do? Gray talks of the need to \u201ckeep protesting and protesting and protesting until things change\u201d, to keep the Black Lives Matter movement at the top of the news agenda.</p> <p>\u201cIt annoyed me to see the whole Madeleine McCann thing come out and try and take away what is going on out there,\u201d Gray says, with reference to how the story of the missing girl has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/04/madeleine-mccann-praia-da-luz-christian-bruckner-strongest-suspect-yet\">returned to the front pages</a> after the identification of a suspect. \u201cThat\u2019s no disrespect to that little girl and her family. But to me it seemed to be trying to brush aside what is really going on in the Black Lives Matter protest.</p> <p>\u201cIs it because she\u2019s a white girl? Yes. That\u2019s the facts. What people are not seeming to understand at the minute is these are the things that are happening.

They don\u2019t get it. All they want to say is: \u2018No, all lives matter,\u2019 but this is not the point. We are fighting because black lives don\u2019t matter. That is as simple as it is.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy for a white person to think we have got it good or whatever but we don\u2019t because you\u2019re not the person that\u2019s getting pulled over by the police, you are not the person that is getting judged by what you wear and how you look. You are not the person that has to pick and choose where you go, what countries you go to because of things like this. They will never get it. That is the ignorance of it.\u201d</p> <p>Gray hopes to see gestures of support from players during Premier League matches, as has happened in the Bundesliga. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want it just to be a phase \u2013 it needs to be for ever,\u201d Gray says. \u201cRacism has been in football since football started, it\u2019s never going away, it\u2019s never got better. It\u2019s just noticed more because everything is on TV, everything is magnified.</p> <p>\u201cSo I hope players take a stand and I hope this is more than just wearing a T-shirt of Kick It Out. That hasn\u2019t worked before and it\u2019s not going to work now. We need to push and have a stronger stand on it.\u201d</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>There\u2019s more to British statues than the ones of Colston and Rhodes highlighted by BLM. From Damien Hirst\u2019s sword-fighter to a cat called Hodge, our critic picks his top 10</p>",
     "body": "<h2><strong>10. </strong>Titanic Memorial, Belfast</h2> <p>The ship, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1912/apr/16/leadersandreply.mainsection\">which sank in 1912</a> with more than 1,500 souls drowned, has become a symbol of the precariousness of existence. It is commemorated by this marble monument in the city where the doomed ocean liner was built. A female mythological figure of Fate looms over a drowning sailor held in a mermaid\u2019s embrace. Created by sculptor Thomas Brock and erected in 1920, it\u2019s a passionate exception to the often tight-lipped statuary of imperial Britain.</p> <h2><strong>9. </strong>Robert Burns, Edinburgh</h2> <p>A contemporary of William Blake and the rustic bard himself, John Flaxman is a forgotten genius of British sculpture. His statue of Scotland\u2019s national poet was commissioned in 1824 for a rotunda on Edinburgh\u2019s Calton Hill. Today this intense Romantic homage to the poet as hero is kept in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, but it is worth climbing the hill to appreciate its original lofty location. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67e426ca9e8e34fbd9c3c9719398f276b70a8fdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67e426ca9e8e34fbd9c3c9719398f276b70a8fdd/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clockwise from top left: Belfast\u2019s Titanic Memorial, Robert Burns, Winston Churchill, the River God,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clockwise from top left: Belfast\u2019s Titanic Memorial, Robert Burns, Winston Churchill, the River God,</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty Images, Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>8. </strong>Winston Churchill, London</h2> <p>Maybe one reason why this statue has become a magnet for graffiti is that it is such a striking presence in Parliament Square. A duller statue would attract less attention. For some, Churchill is a racist responsible for the 1943 Bengal famine; for others, he\u2019s the war hero who saved Britain and defeated Hitler and his murderous doctrine of racial hate. However Churchill is seen, this statue won\u2019t let us forget him. It is a truly characterful work of art. Not for him the proud, upright stance, full of strength and absent of doubt, so common in lesser statues. This is a much more complex, much less celebratory monument, capturing the aged politician hunched over \u2013 weighed down by events, perhaps even by his own conscience and his regrets \u2013 but still strong, still standing. There is more than a touch of Rodin\u2019s expressiveness about it. Ivor Roberts-Jones gave his brooding masterpiece a scale and mass that holds its own among the spires of Westminster, the seat of British power once wielded by this man. It is a statue that magnificently expresses the colossal place of Churchill in British history, and the many sides of the man \u2013 a shielding or oppressive work, depending on your perception of Britain\u2019s most famous war leader.</p> <h2><strong>7. </strong>Hodge the Cat, London</h2> <p>This statue by&nbsp;sculptor Jon Bickley pays homage to a very privileged cat. Hodge belonged to the ebullient dictionary writer and 18th-century wit Samuel Johnson, who fed his pet solely on oysters. He didn\u2019t want his servants to resent looking after a cat so he himself went to get fresh oysters from street-sellers every day. Hodge is included in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.talkingstatueslondon.co.uk/statues/hodge/\">the Talking Statues project</a>, so you can hear him tell his own fat-cat story.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>6. </strong>River God, Stourhead</h2> <p>This fantastical marble statue of a classical deity drips watery encrustations and emanates the mysterious power of nature. You\u2019ll find it in the dark and dreamlike Grotto at Stourhead, Wiltshire. The 18th-century gardens are the setting of an ambitious array of public sculpture intended to educate the nation. Inspired by the art of Renaissance Italy, this garden god takes you out of the ordinary into the sublime. </p> <h2><strong>5. </strong>Millicent Fawcett, London</h2> <p>Famous for her photographs of people in the street holding up signs saying what they\u2019re thinking, Gillian Wearing brings an unpretentious&nbsp;touch to this suffragette memorial in Parliament Square. Fawcett isn\u2019t portrayed in some florid monumental way but as someone just like us, who happened to do something brave. She even has one of Wearing\u2019s signs to share her message. </p> <h2><strong>4. </strong>Another Place, Merseyside</h2> <p>They are neither heroes nor antiheroes. We don\u2019t know what they may have done or are capable of doing. Innocent or evil, oppressed or oppressors, the figures placed on a Merseyside beach by sculptor Antony Gormley are none of these things. They are just human beings. Returning to prehistory for inspiration, Gormley creates universal, open images of our common nature. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"792b227ca4965650a3223c5e423a203777ed137d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/792b227ca4965650a3223c5e423a203777ed137d/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clockwise from top left: Millicent Fawcett , Antony Gormley\u2019s figures on Crosby Beach, the Marquess of Anglesey\u2019s Column, Rodin\u2019s Burghers of Calais.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clockwise from top left: Millicent Fawcett , Antony Gormley\u2019s figures on Crosby Beach, the Marquess of Anglesey\u2019s Column, Rodin\u2019s Burghers of Calais.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty Images, Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>3. </strong>Marquess of Anglesey\u2019s Column, Anglesey</h2> <p>You can barely see the statue of Henry William Paget, Marquess of Anglesey, on top of his tall column, but this monument \u2013 soaring over leafy trees and green water \u2013 is still one of Britain\u2019s most memorable. It shows Anglesey leaning on a stick, a reference to the fact that when this commander in the Napoleonic wars was chatting to the Duke of Wellington at Waterloo, a cannonball tore off his leg.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>2. </strong>Rodin\u2019s Burghers of Calais, London</h2> <p>This compassionate masterpiece asks us to feel for the oppressed. The six citizens of Calais who offered their lives for their town in the Hundred Years War become universal figures of human suffering in Rodin\u2019s expressive hands. As they gesture their supplication in poses that embody a powerful range of moods, from silent dignity to tragic eloquence, they bear witness to history\u2019s crimes and speak for all victims.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>1. </strong>Verity, Ilfracombe</h2> <p>There\u2019s no danger of Damien Hirst\u2019s colossal bronze bisected woman ever fading into the background as so many statues do. She towers over Ilfracombe harbour in Devon, raising a sword skyward for even more height. Hirst explores his obsessive theme of our secret inner anatomy with echoes of Leonardo da Vinci and no regard for anyone\u2019s idea of good taste. This stupefying statue doesn\u2019t commemorate some famous person. Instead, it looks inside us all.&nbsp;<br></p>"

She added: \u201cThe fact that we were striking school was empowering, because it was in your hands rather than asking your parents to go on a Saturday. It redefined the idea of what a protest meant. It really made me feel: I can handle this as long as I\u2019m with a good group of people.\u201d</p> <p>While Popoola said her race has meant she has had her political awakening at a young age, she believes climate strikes have got her generation thinking about politics more deeply.</p> <p>Another 17-year-old protester, who didn\u2019t wish to be named, described the climate strike protests and the BLM movement as core tenets of young people\u2019s identity. \u201cIt\u2019s almost essential to know now.

We\u2019re sorry this recognition comes so late.\u201d</p> <p>The news was welcome to XR Youth, which has long been vocal about the need for greater inclusivity in the organisation, and hopes this is the start of wider change. \u201cThere has been talk for a while now about a fourth demand, about climate justice and racial justice, being added to <a href=\"https://extinctionrebellion.uk/the-truth/demands/\">the current XR demands</a>,\u201d said Rianka Gill from XR Youth. \u201cIt\u2019s already being incorporated into more local XR groups, so my hope is that it reaches the masses.\u201d </p> <p>Lola Fayokun, an 18-year-old student who helped organise the UK school climate strikes, spoke at a BLM digital rally about climate justice, a term that frames the climate crisis as an ethical and political issue, not just an environmental one.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"115c421312cb29127953a0d923ca864a8356c259\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/115c421312cb29127953a0d923ca864a8356c259/0_156_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Lives Matter protest in Brighton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Black Lives Matter protest in Brighton in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Barlow Brown/Sopa Images/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re tackling climate change while ignoring the fact that it will disproportionately impact all the most marginalised people in our society, and they already are bearing the brunt of this crisis, then you\u2019re doing them a grave injustice,\u201d she explained.</p> <p>But this is also a critical moment for environmental groups to tackle racism within the movement itself, she said, and more needs to be done.</p> <p>\u201cIt needs to come into everything.

     "body": "<p>Dominic Raab has prompted criticism and scorn after saying he views the symbolic Black Lives Matter action of taking the knee as \u201ca symbol of subjugation and subordination\u201d, and that it originated from the TV show Game of Thrones.</p> \n<p>In a sometimes eyebrow-raising exchange during a radio interview, the foreign secretary appeared not to know that the stance was popularised by US athletes, notably the American football player <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/19/three-years-in-the-nfl-wilderness-what-colin-kaepernick-lost-and-won\">Colin Kaepernick</a>, as a protest against racism and police brutality.</p> \n<p>Raab said he understood why some people took the knee, but said he would only do so \u201cfor the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me\u201d.</p> \n<p>The pose, used in the past by Martin Luther King for prayer, was adopted as a secular protest against racism in 2016 and has spread widely since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month as a way of showing support for BLM and respect for those killed.</p> \n<p>Speaking on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/talkRADIO/status/1273525908465426432\">talkRadio</a> on Thursday, Raab was asked whether he would adopt the pose. He replied: \u201cDo you know what? I understand this sense of frustration, of restlessness, which is driving the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve got say, on this take the knee thing \u2013 which, I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s got a broader history but it seems to be taken from the Game of Thrones \u2013 feels to me like a symbol of subjugation and subordination, rather than one of liberation and emancipation. But I understand people feel differently about it, so it\u2019s a matter of personal choice.\u201d</p> \n<p>The comment brought criticism from other MPs. David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidLammy/status/1273549760394334208\">tweeted</a>: \u201cThis is not just insulting to the Black Lives Matter movement, it is deeply embarrassing for Dominic Raab. He is supposed to be the foreign secretary of the United Kingdom.\u201d</p> \n<p>Diane Abbott, a former shadow home secretary, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HackneyAbbott/status/1273544733936279552\">said</a>: \u201c\u2018Taking the knee began in 2016 with American athletes refusing to stand for US national anthem. They were protesting police brutality and racism. But Dominic Raab thinks it comes from Game of Thrones!!!\u201d</p> \n<p>Ed Davey, the acting Liberal Democrats leader, told the BBC that Raab should offer \u201ca fulsome apology\u201d, adding that the comments \u201cshow the foreign secretary doesn\u2019t really have a grasp of a key global movement\u201d.</p> \n<p>Anne Soubry, the former Conservative MP, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Anna_Soubry/status/1273589742324592640\">tweeted</a> that Raab was \u201can embarrassment to our country and the party I used to be proud to be a member of\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is among those in the UK who have adopted the pose. Some police officers have also done so at protests, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/17/aston-villa-sheffield-united-players-take-knee-premier-league-black-lives-matter\">Premier League footballers and officials</a> took the knee on Wednesday before the first games since the pause in the season caused by coronavirus.</p> \n<p>The use of taking a knee began in 2016 when Kaepernick, then a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, opted to sit on the team bench rather than stand for the pre-NFL game rendition of the US national anthem, in protest against racism and police brutality.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7b2d80496fd2675ab74443a0fe7835e241779b7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7b2d80496fd2675ab74443a0fe7835e241779b7/0_163_4928_2959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco 49er Colin Kaepernick and two teammates take a knee during the US national anthem before an NFL game in 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">San Francisco 49er Colin Kaepernick and two teammates take a knee during the US national anthem before an NFL game in 2016.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Kaepernick, who was joined by other players, later decided to pose on one knee, saying this made the same point while showing more respect to military veterans. Among those he <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/09/09/646115651/the-veteran-and-nfl-player-who-advised-kaepernick-to-take-a-knee?t=1592480177017\">took advice from</a> was Nate Boyer, a former Green Beret who also played in the NFL.</p> \n<p>Kaepernick\u2019s actions led him to be frozen out of professional sport, and he was criticised by Donald Trump among others. Following the recent BLM protests, he could now return to the NFL, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/17/colin-kaepernick-nfl-los-angeles-chargers-anthony-lynn\">even Trump saying</a> this would not be a problem for him.</p> \n<p>Raab, when asked whether he would take the knee to show solidarity with BLM, said: \u201cI\u2019d take the knee for two people: the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me.\u201d</p> \n<p>On the subject of his wife he added: \u201cBy the way, she disputes that. I had this conversation with her last night. I\u2019m sure I did, but we\u2019d obviously had too much champagne at the time. But I\u2019m certain I did.\u201d</p> \n<p>Responding <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DominicRaab/status/1273565184351756289\">later on Twitter</a>, Raab said: \u201cTo be clear: I have full respect for the Black Lives Matter movement and the issues driving them. If people wish to take a knee, that\u2019s their choice and I respect it. We all need to come together to tackle any discrimination and social injustice.\u201d</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said the prime minister had no comment on the issue. \u201cThe foreign secretary was very clear he was expressing a personal opinion, and he has tweeted about it,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Raab\u2019s Game of Thrones theory is not the first time he has expressed unusual views. In 2018, as Brexit secretary, he prompted criticism and some mockery for saying he had only recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/08/dominic-raab-dover-calais-brexit-uk-france\">appreciated the importance of the Dover-Calais crossing</a> for UK trade.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"35cdd61f-1551-40b8-9514-11af9cd2ecc2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-rLS_GFkfRU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>"

     "body": "<p>Antoinette Nwandu wrote Pass Over partly as a response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/trayvon-martin-george-zimmerman-trial\">Trayvon Martin</a>\u2019s shooting but it was also inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/15/100-best-nonfiction-books-waiting-for-godot-samuel-beckett-robert-mccrum\">Waiting for Godot</a> and the biblical Book of Exodus. Alongside this, the play aims to show \u201cblack Americans wrestling with the dregs of the American dream\u201d.</p> <p>An Old Testament story of faith in deliverance from slavery together with Beckettian nihilism and contemporary race politics are epic \u2013 and almost opposite \u2013 themes to grapple with in an 80-minute play, but Indhu Rubasingham\u2019s production combines all the elements in this absurdist urban tragedy to electrifying effect.</p> <p>Two black homeless Americans, Moses (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/sep/08/bbc-press-star-paapa-essiedu-the-word-diversity-doesnt-mean-anything\">Paapa Essiedu</a>) and Kitch (Gershwyn Eustache Jr) spend their days waiting, not on a country road under a tree like Vladimir and Estragon, but on a grey street corner of an unnamed city. As they wait they feel cowed by the ever-present threat of police brutality and reduced by encounters with white men.</p> <p>Moses and Kitch wear their baseball caps backwards and behave like pastiche versions of young black men, hamming up their street mannerisms (elaborate handshakes, hip-hop swagger) and urban patter. They have playful flights-of-fancy and speak of \u201cpassing over\u201d into a life that is not defined by police persecution, indulging in fantasies of ordering caviar and Cristal champagne from hotel penthouses.</p> <p>Words form part of their knowingly racialised performance: they use the N-word emphatically. By contrast, the outwardly decorous speech of a white stranger called Mister (Alexander Eliot) is full of concealed bigotry and redacted offences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49a902421f1ae978e1725bd570411eafdd7e1ecb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49a902421f1ae978e1725bd570411eafdd7e1ecb/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wholesome, all-American manner ...

Paapa Essiedu and Alexander Eliot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Essiedu and Eustache Jr have an easy chemistry and endow their characters with vulnerable, boyish charm as they play fight or revel in make-believe.</p> <p>We feel their baiting when Mister emerges, offering them food and hamming up his own wholesome, all-American manner with repeated exclamations of \u201cgosh, golly, gee\u201d. In its best moments, Nwandu\u2019s script builds its dread with feeling, rather than dialogue. There are also sudden swerves into unsettling surrealism and outright terror before the tone resets back to comedy. Almost every gearchange works to powerful effect: anxiety roves around between the humour, and tonal lurches leave us feeling increasingly queasy for these men\u2019s fates. The switches are masterfully managed by the actors, with a sensational performance by Eustache Jr, who bursts with mischievous energy, while Essiedu plays Moses more plaintively.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a91912d07c1a14255be70df33536c304e30231ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a91912d07c1a14255be70df33536c304e30231ab/0_0_4468_2681/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Easy chemistry ...

Paapa Essiedu and Gershwyn Eustache Jr in Pass Over.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just as Anna Deavere Smith\u2019s play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/17/notes-from-the-field-review-royal-court-london-anna-deavere-smith\">Notes from the Field</a> spoke directly to America about white-on-black violence, Pass Over does the same. It touched nerves when it was first staged by the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago where <a href=\"https://www.americantheatre.org/2017/06/27/the-review-that-shook-chicago/\">some complained</a> about the depiction of a racist white police officer, Occifer (also played by Eliot). But despite this specificity, it carries resonance for British audiences in its exploration of black masculinity and racism, which seems particularly urgent in light of Dave\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/19/dave-hailed-for-brit-awards-protest-against-racist-boris-johnson\">performance at the Brits</a>.</p> <p>The script begins to speak its messages in the last third of the play, which sound all the more jarring because the dialogue has been so artful until then. But it snaps back to surrealism and regains its symbolic strength by the end. Robert Jones\u2019s set adds to this use of symbols: unlike the all-seeing eyes on the billboard that hang over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fscottfitzgerald\">F Scott Fitzgerald</a>\u2019s American dream novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/25/american-dream-great-gatsby\">The Great Gatsby</a>, a traffic light sign looms over the lives of Moses and Kitch, commanding them to \u201cstop\u201d in the shape of a raised red hand. It is abject shorthand for the nihilism imposed on to their black American dreams.</p> <p>Pass Over is theatre for the heart and head, reinventing and complicating old stories to make them newly and fiercely relevant. If, in these times, we are ever more in need of powerful and provocative political theatre, here it is.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a href=\"https://kilntheatre.com/whats-on/pass-over/\">Kiln, London</a>, until 21 March.</p>"

     "body": "<p>When five friends decided to attend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/13/rightwing-protesters-clash-with-police-in-central-london\">an anti-racism protest in London on Saturday</a>, all they were hoping to do was to protect their younger allies from far-right thugs.</p> <p>Forty-eight hours later, their heroism has created a defining image of the Black Lives Matter movement. They have won the praise of politicians, the adulation of social media, and the attention of newspaper front pages. And Patrick Hutchinson, the man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/14/blm-supporter-speaks-out-after-carrying-counter-protester-to-safety\">photographed with an injured counter-protester</a> hoisted over his shoulder, says his mother cannot stop crying.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s pretty proud,\u201d he said, as the five men geared up for another round of interviews on Monday afternoon and dealt with a flood of messages. \u201cI think a lot of people didn\u2019t even realise it had happened until they saw the news, and loads of them have contacted me today. They\u2019re not taking the mickey just yet. Every time mum sees my face on TV, she just goes.\u201d</p> <p>While it was 49-year-old Hutchinson\u2019s face that became part of the enduring image of the moment, he is clear that the five saved the counter-protester\u2019s life by working together, with the other four \u2013 Pierre Noah, 47, Jamaine Facey, 43, Chris Otokito, 37, and Lee Russell, also 37 \u2013 forming a protective ring as Hutchinson moved the man away from the confrontation after his friends left him there.</p> <p>Now they are equally determined to use their moment in the spotlight to put politicians under pressure to enact real change \u2013 starting with Boris Johnson, whose promise of a government commission to look into racial inequality is met with derision.</p> <p>\u201cHow many reviews do you need?\u201d asked Facey. \u201cEveryone knows what the problem is. Everyone knows funding has been taken out of areas that it shouldn\u2019t have been \u2026 We really need to stop talking and actually put some of the plans that are already there into action.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInvest in the community,\u201d agreed Noah. Addressing the prime minister directly, he added: \u201cWe need funding, Mr Johnson. Help us. We\u2019ve put our lives on the line. What is he ready to do?\u201d</p> <p>Noah said if he ever met the man they saved again, he would want to talk to him and try to \u201ceducate\u201d him. \u201cI\u2019d ask: \u2018Am I that bad? I just saved your life \u2013 am I a bad person because of the colour of my skin?\u2019 I would love to ask him that question.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/15/protect-people-as-quickly-as-statues\">Protect people as quickly as statues | Brief letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hutchinson was less enthusiastic, saying he wasn\u2019t particularly interested in sharing a platform with the man he had taken to safety.</p> <p>Ironically enough, and to his likely irritation, the action that encapsulated the moral gulf between the Black Lives Matter movement and their far-right counterparts was prompted by agitations from Tommy Robinson.</p> <p>\u201cStraight away, I knew that younger people might react to it,\u201d said Noah. \u201cI knew something might happen, so I decided to speak to a couple of my friends \u2013 to be guardian angels, just to look out for everybody. And Patrick, Jamaine, Chris and Lee were up for it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1db3e09bfa0273d266df44660e8a708eaf2209b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1db3e09bfa0273d266df44660e8a708eaf2209b3/0_64_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Hutchinson carries the injured counter-protester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrick Hutchinson carries the injured counter-protester.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Robinson\u2019s invective inspired Facey, too. \u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t stay in my house, and see our kids and daughters getting manhandled by any hooligan,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew we needed to be there. To be guardians, to make sure they don\u2019t get arrested, they don\u2019t commit crime.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe all had the same energy,\u201d agreed Russell. \u201cThe same fire to go. It was easy \u2013 we were all on the same wavelength. These guys were sending out clear messages that they were coming out to do some damage. The irony; they came down to do some damage to people they don\u2019t like, black people, and they ended up getting saved by a bunch of black guys.\u201d</p> <p>The callout went to a WhatsApp group of more than 150 people but only the five friends \u2013 some of whom have known each other since they were in their teens \u2013 showed up.</p> <p>Otokito described the group, who all have martial arts backgrounds, as a \u201cband of brothers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all from similar backgrounds, we\u2019re all from the same community and the streets of London. Same south London background, same morals, same principles. We\u2019re all fathers, we all have our families as well \u2013 we\u2019re trying to set an example,\u201d said Otokito.</p> <p>The group emphasise that while they were glad to save the counter-protester\u2019s life, it was the ruined lives of his would-be assailants and their loved ones that were at the front of their minds. \u201cMy thing was not really saving that man,\u201d said Russell. \u201cIt was more saving one of these black kids that was attacking that guy \u2013 their life could be gone, as well as the gentleman\u2019s. A wasted life in prison because of those moments of madness.\u201d</p> <p>They know little about the man they rescued, but they hope his good fortune will provide a lesson to others. \u201cMaybe it will change the views of racists,\u201d said Russell. \u201cI hope it shows that whatever they think of us, we\u2019re cool, we\u2019re good \u2013 we just saved your life.\u201d</p> <p>For Otokito, though, every bit as important is the message that he hopes the image sends to the black community.</p> <p>\u201cAs a brother, son, nephew, friend, I wanted to set an example, that it\u2019s our responsibility to take ownership,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd hopefully it sends a different narrative to how the image of a black man is usually painted.</p> <p>\u201cNormally, it\u2019s the picture of George Floyd with a knee on his neck. This is a completely different image \u2013 the tables are turned: a black man picking up a white man to put him on his shoulders to take him to safety in the midst of a situation that he\u2019s created for himself. Hopefully, it sends a message that we are capable of being great.\u201d</p> <p>Hutchinson said he wanted the image to be a unifying one. \u201cI hope it\u2019ll change the minds of those who are sitting on the fence, who aren\u2019t sure about this whole thing. I hope it can galvanise us as human beings and bring us together.\u201d</p> <p>Otokito said: \u201cI would like people to look at this as a way to take ownership, to take courage, to be the change. Now you actually see an everyday person \u2013 we\u2019ve all got families, sons, brothers, but we went down to make a change and make a difference.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s only going to happen if everyone stands up together and does that.\u201d</p>"

One social media user said: \u201cCan we have your full political declaration then please. Just so everyone is clear where you stand on all the issues rather than appearing to be opportunistic is order to sell more tea.\u201d</p> <p>The two tea firms are the latest to grapple with a corporate dilemma during the Black Lives Matter movement \u2013 whether declaring their support is a clear communication of brand values, or risks backfiring and appearing opportunistic.</p> <p>Adidas won praise and expressions of scepticism in equal measure when it retweeted a Nike video supporting the movement and wrote: \u201cTogether is how we move forward.

It\u2019s great to do that. But you need to think about what you\u2019re doing yourselves and how you need to improve when you never said&nbsp;a single thing about it before.\u201d</p> <p>Bettys and Taylors Group has no minority ethnic executives on its eight-strong board and senior executive group. It finished 34th out of 47 brands on a 2018 Ethical Consumer guide to the sector. Unilever\u2019s PG Tips finished 46th, scoring two out of a possible 20 points.</p> <p>The two companies use tea grown in Assam. Both have pointed to steps they have taken to improve the conditions of the workers there,&nbsp;and have published a list of their suppliers. However, a <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59242ebc03596e804886c7f4/t/5b27a6270e2e72364827f389/1529325117476/The+Estate+They%27re+In.pdf\">Traidcraft report</a>, published in January, accused them and a number of other UK tea brands of \u201cknowing about the conditions for women working on tea estates but not doing enough about them\u201d.

Three of the men had been scheduled to be put to death when Barr announced the federal government would resume executions last year, ending an informal moratorium on federal capital punishment.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe American people, acting through Congress and Presidents of both political parties, have long instructed that defendants convicted of the most heinous crimes should be subject to a sentence of death,\u201d Barr said in a statement. \u201cThe four murderers whose executions are scheduled today have received full and fair proceedings under our Constitution and laws. We owe it to the victims of these horrific crimes, and to the families left behind, to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The move is likely to add a new front to the national conversation about criminal justice reform and raise interest in an issue that has largely lain dormant in recent years. The Justice Department had scheduled five executions set to begin in December, but these were halted after legal challenges. The department wouldn\u2019t say why the executions of two of the inmates scheduled in December hadn\u2019t been rescheduled.</p> \n  <p>Three of the executions are scheduled for July, with one in August.

     "body": "<p>Bernardine Evaristo and Reni Eddo-Lodge have become the first black British women to top the UK\u2019s fiction and nonfiction paperback charts, in a week where black authors lined up to slam British publishing as a \u201chostile environment\u201d, and as bookshop chain Waterstones is being urged by staff to donate to the Black Lives Matter movement in the wake of soaring sales of black authors.</p> <p>Evaristo\u2019s Booker-winning novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/08/girl-woman-other-by-bernardine-evaristo-review\">Girl, Woman, Other</a> topped the paperback fiction chart this week, making her the first woman of colour to take that spot. And Eddo-Lodge topped the paperback nonfiction chart with her 2017 book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/30/why-im-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race\">Why I\u2019m No Longer Talking to White People About Race</a>, making her the first black British author to hold the spot. Barack and Michelle Obama have both topped the hardback nonfiction charts, as has British chef Lorraine Pascale.</p> <p>Eddo-Lodge said it was \u201ca horrible indictment of the publishing industry\u201d that it had taken so long for a black British author to be No 1.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests continue around the world, several bestselling authors have spoken out against the predominantly white publishing world. On Wednesday morning, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DorothyKoomson/status/1270385120114085891\">bestselling novelist Dorothy Koomson</a>, who was supported by writers including Nii Ayikwei Parkes and Courttia Newland, slammed UK publishing as a \u201chostile environment for black authors\u201d and criticised those in the industry for posting \u201cgaslighting social media posts\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI have watched people who have made it clear over the years that they wouldn\u2019t spit on me and my kind if I was on fire now asking for submissions from black and minority ethnic voices. To what end? So you can demean, demoralise and discard them?\u201d Koomson asked. \u201cDo better, publishing people. Do better, be better, treat us better. Talk to us, listen to us, stop going out there with words of support and look inside with your actions to improve the environment for black authors \u2026 enough public posturing, all right?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/jun/03/do-the-work-an-anti-racist-reading-list-layla-f-saad\">Do the work: an anti-racist reading list |  Layla F Saad</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A<a href=\"https://platform.organise.org.uk/campaigns/waterstones-blm\"> petition from Waterstones staff, meanwhile, has called on the UK\u2019s largest bookseller to financially support the Black Lives Matter movement</a>, particularly in the wake of the \u201cmassive revenues\u201d that anti-racist books are generating for the retailer online. Waterstones\u2019 chart is currently topped by Eddo-Lodge and Evaristo, with Layla F Saad\u2019s Me and White Supremacy, Akala\u2019s Natives and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/16/white-fragility-racism-interview-robin-diangelo\">Robin DiAngelo\u2019s White Fragility</a> filling out the Top 5.</p> <p>Originally sent among staff, the petition has now been opened to the public <a href=\"https://twitter.com/organisehq/status/1269570877622030337\">\u201cwithout a satisfactory response\u201d</a> from the chain, according to staff. It has been signed by more than 5,000 people, and backed by writers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PhilipPullman/status/1269631601631166464\">including Philip Pullman</a>. \u201cWe believe it is time for Waterstones to stand up beyond an Instagram post or a tweet and provide substantive support for the black community who are fundamental to our bookstores,\u201d say the signatories.</p> <p>But while Waterstones called it an \u201cexcellent idea\u201d, it said that because all of its shops have been closed since 23 March, and the great majority of its staff remain on furlough, \u201cwith the best will in the world, we are not in a position to make a charitable donation at present, however much we would like to do so\u201d.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Waterstones managing director James Daunt said the company was still discussing \u201cwhat may be possible\u201d for a future donation project, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/28/authors-waterstones-buy-books-syria-refugee-crisis\">along the lines of the Waterstones campaign that raised \u00a31m for Syrian refugees</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThese need to be done well and in a considered manner. Rushing would likely end in a misstep, and the point about our current situation is an unfortunate reality. There is talk of profits when the making of profit is a distant prospect right now,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Evaristo described her position, as not only the first black woman, but the first woman of colour, to top the UK fiction paperback chart, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BernardineEvari/status/1270616544075231233\">as astonishing</a>. The only other writer of colour to take the spot was Marlon James, after the Jamaican writer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/10/brief-history-of-seven-killings-marlon-james-reviewhttps://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/10/brief-history-of-seven-killings-marlon-james-review\">A Brief History of Seven Killings</a> won the Booker prize in 2015.</p> <p>Eddo-Lodge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/03/anti-racist-book-sales-surge-us-uk-george-floyd-killing-robin-diangelo-white-fragility\">has previously asked</a> readers buying her book in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests to match the price they paid with a donation to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://minnesotafreedomfund.org/\">Minnesota Freedom Fund</a>. \u201cThis book financially transformed my life and I really don\u2019t like the idea of personally profiting every time a video of a black person\u2019s death goes viral,\u201d she said last week.</p>"

Sure, a feast of largely and increasingly meaningless end-of-season matches, but let the quantity not be in doubt.</p> \n  <p>And there is no meaninglessness today. Aston Villa sit 19th with 10 games to play, but know a win would vault them into the giddy heights of 16th. Sheffield United are seventh, but would be fifth by bedtime should they pocket the three points here.</p> \n  <p>It seems crass in the context of a global pandemic to talk about survival in a mere sporting sense, but Villa\u2019s ambition is to stay in the Premier League for another season and with some difficult fixtures to come a few instant points would certainly help. It seems equally crass given its cause to say that the break came at a good time for them, but they had lost their previous four league games and seemed to already be sliding down the slippery slope of sporting oblivion before being given an opportunity to reset, and to welcome John McGinn into their line-up after long-term ankleknack.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile the amateur psychologist in me says that the Blades might have spent the last few months gazing with pride at the league table and planning for the next campaign, and with the wind ripped from their sails might struggle to regain the momentum that seemed set to carry them all the way to Europe. It would be understandable if they tailed off a little from here, but frankly it would also be unsurprising if Chris Wilder just kept producing more miracles from his magic hat.</p> \n  <p>All that, plus we get to marvel at an entirely empty Villa Park, ponder whether any fans will turn up to loiter outside soaking up the sound of faint and muffled oofs and thwacks floating from within, and boggle at whatever madcap innovations will be crowbarred into the stadium instead of them. At best it could be an absolute thriller, and at worst it will be mildly intriguing. Welcome everyone, I\u2019ve missed you all.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-17T16:00:34.369Z\">at 5.00pm BST</time></p> \n</div>"

Just like my players don\u2019t have to ask me for permission to go to a supermarket where there is as much chance of contracting the virus.\u201d</p> <p>Smith, whose side will host Sheffield United when the Premier League reboots on Wednesday, is acutely aware of the dangers of the coronavirus. Villa\u2019s on-loan goalkeeper, Pepe Reina, was seriously ill with it in March, as was one of the club\u2019s masseurs, who spent weeks in intensive care before recovering. In May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/27/aston-villa-manager-dean-smiths-father-ron-dies-after-contracting-covid-19\">Smith lost his father, Ron, to the disease</a>.</p> <p>The 79-year-old had been suffering with dementia for some time. The manager was at least thankful he was able to say goodbye to his father. \u201cHe was in the care home when he contracted coronavirus but he was asymptomatic and then three days later we had a call that he had been taken to hospital by paramedics,\u201d Smith said on Monday. \u201cIt was tough for my mum because she couldn\u2019t see him for 11 weeks. But he ended up coming out to a nursing home and we were allowed to go and see him in our full PPE at the moment he passed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/08/premier-league-restart-preview-aston-villa\">Premier League restart preview No 2: Aston Villa | Paul Doyle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cTiming is never good to lose a parent but he is probably in a better place now because he hadn\u2019t been well for a long time so it was one of those things you have to deal with.\u201d</p> <p>There is no easy way to segue from a family bereavement to the day job. But that is what Smith, like all too many other people in this grim time, must do. In his case the relatively mundane matter to hand is the resumption of Villa\u2019s fight against relegation. On that front, at least, lockdown brought a welcome development as the influential midfielder John McGinn has overcome the ankle injury that kept him out of action since before Christmas.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a top player but on top of being a top player, he\u2019s a top character in that dressing room and gives everyone a boost by being the person he is,\u201d Smith said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nevertheless, Smith said casting McGinn straight back into the starting lineup may be unwise. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have him back but I have to manage him accordingly.
