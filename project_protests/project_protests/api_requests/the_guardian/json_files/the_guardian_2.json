There was a sign, Hakeem Ward remembers, beneath which someone had left an offering.</p> <p>\u201cThe sign said it was a slave burial ground,\u201d he says. \u201cWe went and Googled it, and then I realised it was actually one of the biggest slave burial grounds in the western hemisphere.\u201d</p> <p>Ward, 24, lives nearby, within sight of the turquoise waters that lap at Barbados\u2019 south coast, but had never learned until then of the Newton Slave Burial Ground, where the remains of an estimated 570 enslaved people were found interred in unmarked graves. At school he says they brushed lightly over the history of the slave trade on the island. \u201cWe learned a lot of stuff about Christopher Columbus and how he discovered and colonised the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7bc2a6a0ca6b77d0a5a68ecb90f139189a3b3696\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bc2a6a0ca6b77d0a5a68ecb90f139189a3b3696/0_0_1080_1620/667.jpg\" alt=\"Hakeem Ward\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hakeem Ward.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Cadogan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the past still agitates, making itself known. Dogs occasionally vanish into the bushland, returning with skulls and other remains, Ward says. He and his friends try to avoid hanging out near the site. \u201cWith the spiritual energy, we don\u2019t want to see anything,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause we see things, and we want to avoid that as much as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Late on Monday night, local time, Barbados will declare itself a republic, becoming the first nation to remove Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state in nearly three decades. The transition, flagged last year in the thick of activism inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, is being executed amicably, in the presence of Prince Charles, and circumspectly, more than 20 years since it was recommended by a government commission.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/11/archive-2-zip/giv-825bsv5m6v4pwtX/\" data-alt=\"new map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2021/11/archive-2-zip/giv-825bsv5m6v4pwtX/\">new map</a> </figure>  <p>But, unmistakably, it is a repudiation of the British monarchy, part of a wider campaign that includes strengthening ties with the African nations from which most Barbadians claim heritage and renewing demands for the UK government to make reparations for its historical crimes. Aimed at authoring a liberated future, many hope it will also soothe the restless ghosts of the past.</p> <h2>\u2018Barbados was a hellhole\u2019</h2> <p>As its peak tourism season approaches, Barbados is bearing the brunt of its worst Covid-19 wave. Masks are ubiquitous and many supermarkets and government buildings have installed imposing machines to check temperatures. Still, visitors are coming, drawn by the island\u2019s famously pristine beaches, lush hinterland and gentle weather.</p> <p>It was these same natural blessings that made the easternmost island in the Caribbean an exquisite laboratory for the development of a new form of capitalism in the 17th century. Sugar, backbreaking to produce and for centuries reserved for Europe\u2019s ultra-wealthy, flourished in Barbados\u2019 rich soil. The island\u2019s even topography offered vast space for plantations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/oct/12/africa-slaves-erased-from-history-modern-world\">Built on the bodies of slaves: how Africa was erased from the history of the modern world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it was a third innovation, the perfection of a model using enslaved Africans to work the fields, which set off a \u201csugar revolution\u201d that made England extraordinarily wealthy and created a template that soon spread across the Americas. \u201cIt was in Barbados that the slavery plantation production model was invented \u2013 right here,\u201d says David Comissiong, the country\u2019s ambassador to Caricom, a Caribbean regional integration body.</p> <p>Reclassified under British law as property, the men, women and children who worked the cane fields of Barbados were subject to unimaginable brutality. <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/oa.1108\">The first systematic study of the health of those buried</a> at the Newton Slave Burial Ground found the average life expectancy of those examined was 18 years old, with the lives of women thought to be especially appalling: until then, no lower mean age of death had been documented among enslaved females anywhere in the world. \u201cBarbados was a hellhole,\u201d Comissiong says. \u201cFor black people, Barbados was a brutal, hellish society.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9e8fdf50bfc96893b8f798121e34632cc2297a8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e8fdf50bfc96893b8f798121e34632cc2297a8b/0_201_1306_805/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Newton Burial Ground\" width=\"1000\" height=\"616\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Newton Slave Burial Ground.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Cadogan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is easy to be among the more than 1 million people who visited Barbados each year before the pandemic and never encounter this history. There is a single statue commemorating emancipation, at the centre of a busy roundabout, depicting a man who has come to be identified with Bussa, the leader of a failed 19th-century revolt, whose broken chains dangle from arms raised skyward.</p> <p>For centuries after slavery ceased, over the island\u2019s shameful history, \u201cthere was almost a kind of indifference, a kind of silence\u201d, recalls Esther Phillips, Barbados\u2019 poet laureate, that she believes stems in part from guilt and shame among those who were freed. \u201cWho wants to revisit the pain of trauma, once you get out of it, or appear to get out?\u201d</p> <p>That muffling was passed down through generations, and reinforced in the colonial education of her youth, which some argue has not sufficiently been reformed to this day. \u201cI never knew there was anything called West Indian history or Caribbean history,\u201d Phillips says. \u201cI knew all about the English queens and kings.\u201d</p> <p>The decades since Barbados became independent 55 years ago have seen gradual efforts to face the past, and confront its implications for the future, but always cautiously. A government commission in the 1970s examined the question of becoming a republic and advised against it, conscious that similar experiments in Caribbean states such as Suriname and Guyana had led to authoritarianism and instability.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"133d996e40934e8907fa02311e83e939cbab2eab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/133d996e40934e8907fa02311e83e939cbab2eab/0_57_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trainers wade in the sea with horses from the Garrison Savannah horse racing track in Bridgetown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Horse trainers in the sea with horses from the Garrison Savannah horse racing track in Bridgetown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even the Barbadian leaders who wanted to break away from the monarchy recognised they still lived in the world colonialism made, and had an economy critically dependent on attracting a pipeline of sun-starved British tourists.</p> <p>\u201cThe fear, I think reasonably, was that it would not be received well, and that there would be a narrative, for example, of telling tourists in the UK: \u2018Maybe you should wait about going to Barbados, because you should make sure the political situation is stable,\u2019\u201d says Melanie Newton, a professor of history at the University of Toronto.</p> <p>Part of this conservatism, too, was pragmatic: Barbados was building a society that was, by any measure, a tremendous success, with some of the best human-development indicators in the formerly colonised world, an enormous leap from the <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/the-moyne-report\">desperate conditions that prevailed</a> in the last decades of British rule. \u201cBarbados has a very strong public service system, amazing education, good healthcare,\u201d Newton says. \u201cAnd a lot of that is paid for by tourism and international business and investment banking.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018In Barbados, what are we doing?\u2019</h2> <p>Over the past week, workers have been busy erecting and painting a dais in central Bridgetown\u2019s national heroes\u2019 square, formerly called Trafalgar, where the handover ceremony will take place at 11pm on Monday, and the surrounding colonial buildings \u2013 including the country\u2019s Gothic parliament, the third oldest in the world \u2013 are decked in the national colours, ultramarine and gold.</p> <p>At the head of the square stands a grand pedestal \u2013 with nothing on it.</p> <p>The year 2020 produced seismic changes everywhere.

He would pass national heroes\u2019 square, glancing at the statue of the English admiral Horatio Nelson that had stood there since 1813, three years earlier than its twin in London.</p> <p>At 32, Downes was part of the first generation without memory of Barbados\u2019 colonial-era nor its hangover in the early years of independence. He and his friends were more inclined to question the things their parents took for granted, he says. \u201cSometimes I would talk to my father, as we drove through certain areas, and he would be like, \u2018Oh, when I was a kid, I couldn\u2019t come to this area.\u2019 And I\u2019d be, like, why not?\u201d</p> <p>Those things included the pride of place given to the defender of British slavery Nelson, whose bronze statue had first stirred small protests decades earlier, to which the government had responded in 1990 by rotating it to face away from town. \u201cThe compromise wasn\u2019t, let\u2019s get rid of it,\u201d says Downes. \u201cIt was, literally, just turn it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d091b9e0dc54a344504a3949a7a1c1a2c2410131\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d091b9e0dc54a344504a3949a7a1c1a2c2410131/156_33_1463_1827/801.jpg\" alt=\"Statue of Horatio Nelson in Barbados\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The statue of Horatio Nelson in heroes\u2019 square in Barbados.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel R Browne/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the middle of the year, Black Lives Matter protests were spreading across the world, including to Barbados, and Downes sensed that in his careful society, something was shifting. After consulting with friends, he posted a petition calling for Nelson to come down.</p> <p>\u201cI said to myself, in Barbados, what are we doing?\u201d he says. \u201cWe have a colonial past, we have a past steeped in racism \u2026 [The statue] is just brick and mortar. If we can start with this, then we can get the ball rolling to start addressing some bigger issues.\u201d</p> <p>It caught fire, attracting more than 10,000 signatures and culminated in meetings with government officials and, months after, confirmation that Nelson would be removed in November 2020 and relocated to a museum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac03406da8fdad35a203216aebd7b140377dbae8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac03406da8fdad35a203216aebd7b140377dbae8/0_432_558_335/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Nelson statue on the back of a vehicle after it was taken down\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nelson statue on the back of a vehicle after it was taken down.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Senator Crystal Haynes/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some objected, including among the more than 90% of the population with African heritage, urging him to not to meddle with the past, Downes says. \u201cThey were saying, \u2018Why do you want to move this thing that has been there from before you were even born? Have some respect for your history.\u2019 I\u2019m, like, 10 years from now, what I do today is going to be our history as well,\u201d he says.</p> <p>At the ceremony to mark the removal of the statue, Barbados\u2019 prime minister, Mia Mottley, called the tribute to the hero of Trafalgar, \u201can assertion of power, of dominance\u201d. She held her phone to the crowd, telling them her screensaver was the reggae artist Bob Marley, \u201cto remind me always that the mission of our generation is the mental emancipation of our people\u201d.</p> <p>In the ruptures of the year, Mottley appeared to sense an opportunity. The same day the statue was dislodged, her government announced that, in a year\u2019s time, Barbados would remove the queen as head of state and elect its own president.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0f2f8b75b1ee4410b1f5255fec2909d958676715\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f2f8b75b1ee4410b1f5255fec2909d958676715/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People relax outside restaurants in Bridgetown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People relax outside restaurants in Bridgetown on 17 November.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Monarchists have worried for years that the end of the reign of Elizabeth Windsor may trigger a new wave of former colonies to seek native heads of state. Barbados suggests that threat, at least in the Caribbean, may have arrived in her diamond jubilee years instead, as a conviction stirring in the minds of some of her youngest generation of subjects.</p> <p>Asked what the crown means to him, Downes is clear. \u201cIt signifies a time when people who looked like me \u2026 were almost considered just a part in the process of generating wealth,\u201d he says. \u201cHumanity was not considered. Civil rights were not considered.\u201d</p> <p>At sundown, before the cars on the nearby highway switch on their lights, the view from the top of the slope of the Newton Slave Burial Ground appears much as it may have three hundred years ago. The stone chimney of the plantation\u2019s boiling house still stands. There is still the sea on the horizon and bristling pastures of sugar cane in every direction.</p> <p>The burial site, too, is still an open field, but for the park benches recently installed at its edges, and rows of bougainvillaea and crotons lining the perimeter. They are freshly planted, some still seedlings, and dwarfed by the surrounding cane fields, but growing.</p> <p>\u2022 The map in this article was amended on 30 November 2021 to add detail about the dispute over the British Indian Ocean Territory/Chagos Islands.</p>"

That\u2019s how we got to a courtroom in the first place.

Chauvin had pinned Floyd to the ground with his knee for more than nine minutes outside a grocery store after police responded to a claim that Floyd had tried to spend a fake $20 bill.</p> <p>Many of the jurors recounted their experience watching the video in court, the first time some of them has seen the footage.</p> <p>\u201cIt bothered me so much,\u201d said Jodi Doud who became withdrawn from family and friends while she served as a juror on the Chauvin trial. \u201cHow could somebody do that to someone else?

Asked whether the palace supported BLM, Olisa said: \u201cThe answer is easily yes.\u201d</p> <p>His comments come after a period in which the royal family\u2019s record on race has come under scrutiny.

But we welcome anyone that agrees with our goal of dismantling white supremacy. Of course, actions speak louder than words. The Queen sits on a throne made from colonial plunder. Until she gives back all the stolen gold and diamonds from the Commonwealth and pays reparations, these are nothing more than warm words.\u201d</p> <p>In the Winfrey interview, Meghan said an unnamed royal \u2013 not the Queen or Duke of Edinburgh \u2013 raised concerns with Harry before the birth of their son, Archie, about how dark their son Archie\u2019s skin tone might be.</p> <p>The couple also suggested racism could have been a factor behind the decision to deny Archie security protection and the title of prince.</p> <p>The Queen later issued a statement saying that the issues raised would be dealt with privately but that \u201csome recollections may vary\u201d. The Duke of Cambridge said: \u201cWe\u2019re very much not a racist family.\u201d</p> <p>Patrick Vernon, a cultural historian and co-author of 100 Great Black Britons, said if the Queen truly embraced BLM \u201cthe next logical question would be what is she going to do about it, in terms of allyship, which is no different to conversations I\u2019ve been having with people in the private sector when I\u2019ve done talks on this issue in the last couple of years.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is she going to demonstrate through allyship around supporting black and brown people and also acknowledging her privilege? In many ways she is the ultimate in privilege.\u201d</p> <p>He suggested several actions she could take, including:</p> <ul> <li><p>Making an explicit statement supporting BLM.</p></li> <li><p>Increasing the diversity of staff employed by Buckingham Palace.</p></li> <li><p>Ending the Queen\u2019s personal exemption from equality laws.</p></li> <li><p>Acknowledging the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a> and supporting a proper compensation scheme for its victims.</p></li> </ul> <p>In June, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/24/buckingham-palace-aims-to-improve-diversity-of-its-staff\">the palace said it \u201cmust do more\u201d</a> after publishing figures that revealed its proportion of ethnic minority employees stood at 8.5%, against a target of 10% by next year. It declined to comment on Olisa\u2019s remarks.</p> <p>Asked if he was pleased the Queen supported BLM, Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said it was \u201ca matter for the palace\u201d.</p> <p>On whether the prime minister supported BLM, the spokesman said: \u201cHe has said himself he has always supported the right of people to peacefully protest and make their feelings known.\u201d<br></p>"

These are groups that include educational projects, campaign groups, police monitoring projects, as well as some of the new protest groups, which helped organise at the demonstrations in the summer of last year,\u201d Cooper said.</p> <p>He said the release of some of the funds comes \u201cin a year that I think is going to be really crucial for independent black organising\u201d.</p> <p>Kelbert said they would be doing an announcement with the groups being funded in the next few weeks. She added the group, which was once a loose network of activists, would move forward as a resource organisation that black-led organisations could turn to for support.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things we\u2019re really invested in is making sure that the money that we\u2019ve been able to raise can build sustainable projects, campaigns, and movements in this country that go beyond simply protest in individual cities or individual communities, but can build a broad-based national network, campaign and movements for anti-racism in this country,\u201d Cooper said.</p> <p>The announcement comes as activists from the youth group All Black Lives UK (ABLUK), which were behind some of last year\u2019s biggest protests, including the protest in Bristol that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/07/blm-protesters-topple-statue-of-bristol-slave-trader-edward-colston\">toppled the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston</a>, vowed to return to protesting once lockdown was eased.</p> <p>More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/29/george-floyd-death-fuelled-anti-racism-protests-britain\">260 towns and cities held protests in June and July</a> \u2013 from Monmouth in south Wales to Shetland in Scotland. British historians described them as the largest anti-racism rallies since the slavery era.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re planning more protests, more community outreach, trying to speak to the government, and creating a safe space for black people,\u201d said Aima, 19, one of the co-founders of the group, who did not want to give her last name.</p> <p>Gurpreet Kaur, the founder of BLM in the Stix, a campaign group launched in August to support activists in rural communities across the UK fight racism in their local area, now has over 100 members in its network. The group holds regular meetings with its members, providing anti-racist resources and mental health support, and launched an anti-racism book club.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so tiring and they feel so isolated so we want to make sure they have a good level of support and help, networking for them is essential so they have a community to fall back on,\u201d Kaur said.</p> <p>She said the group was planning a large-scale anti-racism communication campaign across rural communities. \u201cThere\u2019s a few national organisations that are keen to work with us to support rural communities to become anti-racist, and open their eyes to what\u2019s going on under their noses.\u201d</p> <p>Natasha, a co-founder of ABLUK, expects the year ahead to be a crucial one for anti-racist activists. \u201c2020 was just the foundation for what\u2019s going to happen now.\u201d<br></p>"

They are on trial alongside Jake Skuse, 33, who is accused of helping to roll the bronze to Bristol harbour where it was thrown into the River Avon.</p> <p>Opening the defence for Willoughby at Bristol crown court on Wednesday, barrister Liam Walker told jurors they would hear evidence that the statue of Colston \u201cwas in fact indecent and threatening, particularly to members of the black community in Bristol\u201d.</p> <p>Colston \u201ccast a shadow\u201d over Bristol \u201cuntil the very statue that venerated him was forcibly and, we submit, lawfully removed from its plinth\u201d, Walker added.</p> <p>He said: \u201cEdward Colston oversaw the genocide of 19,000 human beings \u2013 that number included children. All of them were enslaved with a brutality that you will learn about and will no doubt conclude is as upsetting as it is shocking.</p> <p>\u201cHe is not, as has been described, a \u2018divisive figure\u2019. Colston\u2019s vile, immoral enrichment and indeed his life should not, I suggest, divide opinion in the slightest.\u201d</p> <p>Walker said the actions and values of his client were \u201cdiametrically opposed\u201d to those of Colston, and that he had never disputed his role in tearing the statue down.</p> <p>\u201cYou will recall, from his [Willoughby\u2019s] interview, that he said: \u2018The statue was a monument to racism\u2019,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThat its presence felt, to him, \u2018like a hate crime\u2019 and that \u2018at that moment, it felt like the right thing to do. To take the statue down\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, the court heard from Ponsford, who told the court he and Willoughby had been friends for about two years. Giving evidence in his own defence, Ponsford told the court how he had brought rope with him to the protest.</p> <p>Asked by his barrister, Tom Wainwright, what was happening when he arrived at the statue, Ponsford said: \u201cThere was a black man who confronted the statue saying how he couldn\u2019t bear to look at the statue in the eyes on that day. He was saying: \u2018Please don\u2019t take the cloth [which someone had placed over Colston\u2019s head] off.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAnd people were stood around chanting and cheering for the statue to come down.\u201d</p> <p>Ponsford said they were chanting: \u201cColston must fall, bring him down.\u201d</p> <p>It was then that Ponsford retrieved a black rope from his rucksack and passed it to people who had already climbed the plinth, the court heard. \u201cThose individuals then secured the ropes \u2026 around the neck of the statue and then jumped down once they were secured tightly,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Ponsford described how protesters \u201cwere jumping to get a chance to hold the rope\u201d and \u201cas many people as possible\u201d took hold of the end he was holding. After he made sure there was no one standing where the statue might fall, he said, he gave a signal.</p> <p>\u201cI believe I put my fist in the air,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people started pulling on the rope.\u201d</p> <p>Skuse, Graham, Ponsford and Willoughby all deny criminal damage. The case continues.</p>"

It is the first public evidence that the police have sought to recruit a mole within the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter movement</a> in the UK.</p> <p>Lawyers representing the activist, who is in her early 20s, have submitted a complaint to South Wales police, arguing that the attempted recruitment was \u201cincredibly frightening and distressing\u201d.

The non-violent group has supported local campaigns against alleged police brutality and racism.</p> <p>In March an officer calling herself Rachel Williams called Davies on her phone out of the blue at her home. Davies started to record the conversation soon after it started.</p> <p>Williams is recorded saying: \u201cOur department, we work with police informants basically. So it could be for a range of different reasons, some persons speak to us because of their involvement with drugs or burglary.\u201d She added: \u201cObviously, in your case the reason for the contact is because of your involvement with the protests.\u201d</p> <p>Williams discussed meeting Davies with her superior the following day. Describing herself as not an \u201covert\u201d police officer, Williams said: \u201cWe don\u2019t meet people at police stations, and we don\u2019t meet people at their home addresses, again because of the covert nature of my role. We are not seen anywhere. We would arrange to meet you where we know you\u2019re not going to be compromised, and where nobody is going to see you with us.\u201d</p> <p>Williams said she wanted Davies to supply information about far-right activists who had protested at Black Lives Matter demonstrations in south Wales. She said she was looking for advanced information about whether the far right could cause violence at anti-racist demonstrations. \u201cIt\u2019s that potential for any risk or anything that you could see that could potentially develop \u2026 persons turning up who are not for your cause that could cause problems for yourself.

Three times the officer implored Davies not to tell anyone else about the attempt to recruit her. She also asked Davies not to bring any recording devices to their meeting the next day, adding: \u201cThe only thing I would ask is for you not to tell anybody about this phone call, just to avoid any potential compromise or threat of physical harm to yourself.\u201d</p> <p>When Davies met Williams and her superior in a car the following day, she said, the two officers checked that her phone was switched off and could not record the 90-minute meeting. The officers drove her around Swansea as they tried to recruit her. She said they asked her about her family and also suggested that she would be rewarded for information she supplied.</p> <p>Davies said the officers also suggested they were interested in information about other leftwing groups.</p> <p>The disclosures are likely to heighten longstanding criticism that police in the UK are carrying out unjustified surveillance of political groups that are engaged in democratic and lawful protests.</p> <p>A judge-led public inquiry is examining the activities of undercover police officers who spied on more than 1,000 political groups over more than four decades. The government was forced to set up the inquiry after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/28/secrets-and-lies-untangling-the-uk-spy-cops-scandal\">series of revelations</a> about the misconduct of the undercover officers. These included the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/28/police-spying-inquiry-examine-targeting-black-justice-groups\"> monitoring of black justice groups</a>, including several run by grieving families whose relatives were killed by police.</p> <p>As well as deploying undercover officers, police have for years run a secret network of informants within protest groups. Rarely heard about, they are members of political groups who are persuaded by police to covertly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/undercover-with-paul-lewis-and-rob-evans/2013/nov/21/undercover-police-and-policing-ukcrime\">supply them with information about protests</a>, often for cash.</p> <p>Kat Hobbs, of the <a href=\"https://netpol.org/black-lives-matter/\">Network for Police Monitoring</a>, a civil liberties group that has investigated the policing of Black Lives Matter protests, said: \u201cGiven the police response to the growing power of the BLM movement, it\u2019s likely that many more people have faced this kind of intimidation and this may be just tip of the iceberg.\u201d</p> <p>The total number of informants within political groups across the UK is kept secret by the police. Some are recruited through the payment of money. In 2013 an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/14/police-cambridge-university-secret-footage\">officer offered cash to a Cambridge environmental</a> activist in return for a steady flow of information about students and leftwing protesters. Four years earlier, Scottish police offered to pay the environmental protester <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/24/strathclyde-police-plane-stupid-recruit-spy\">Tilly Gifford substantial sums of cash for</a> information about leading campaigners, claiming that: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/25/police-informers-tape-recordings-gifford\">\u201cUK plc can afford more than 20 quid.\u201d</a></p> <p>South Wales police said it could neither confirm or deny any details, and it could not comment while the complaint from Davies was being considered.</p> <p>A spokesperson said: \u201cThe use of informants is a well-established and highly regulated tactic used by police forces across the country to protect the public. Their use is controlled within strict legal parameters by trained specialised staff and the accountability and protection of the informant and the public is paramount.</p> <p>\u201cProtest organisers have an obligation to liaise with police forces, and South Wales police has a proven track record in working with organisers to facilitate lawful protest while minimising disruption to the wider public.\u201d</p>"

It\u2019s being pushed in from the street at the bottom and the way the handcuffs are manipulated \u2026 totally interfere with central features of how we breathe,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The doctor told the jury that for nearly five minutes under Chauvin\u2019s knee Floyd was still speaking which shows \u201cthat his oxygen levels were enough to keep his brain alive\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/tell-us-black-parents-children-us-police-violence-the-talk\">Tell us: are you a Black parent talking to your children about US police violence?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>After that there is evidence of brain damage. The doctor said Floyd\u2019s leg can be seen kicking out which is a sign of a myotonic seizure caused by lack of oxygen.</p> \n<p>Tobin said that when Floyd lost consciousness the level of oxygen in his lungs was well below half the normal amount.</p> \n<p>The defence attempted to claim Chauvin was following his training, but in convicting him of second-degree murder the jury rejected the assertion that the former police officer was permitted to put his knee on the victim\u2019s neck for an extended period of time.</p> \n<p>The defence also attempted to claim that Chauvin\u2019s actions had nothing to do with Floyd\u2019s death, and that he died from a cardiac arrest caused by an enlarged and diseased heart, and exacerbated by drug use.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7df98ba2-a75c-48c0-9349-f6aa775c2b7e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XdJHg8-_4QM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But that did not wash with the jury, perhaps because the excruciating video of Floyd\u2019s suffering revealed an officer who showed cavalier indifference as he defied calls from bystanders and even one of his fellow officers to remove his knee and help the detained man.</p> \n<p>Prosecution experts said that although Floyd had heart problems, he would not have died if it had not been for the police cutting off his oxygen supply.</p> \n<p>Chauvin is expected to appeal, although he will face an uphill struggle to get the verdicts overturned, given that murder convictions are overwhelmingly upheld. The grounds for appeal could include that the convicted former police officer did not get a fair trial because of publicity around the case.</p> \n<p>His lawyer, Eric Nelson, raised the issue at the end of the trial, telling the judge that the jury should have been sequestered throughout the whole trial, not just while it considered the verdict. Nelson also raised concerns that protests over the recent police killing of Daunte Wright, just 10 miles from the trial, may have influenced the jury.</p> \n<p>Nelson also sought a mistrial over comments by a member of Congress, Maxine Waters, who called for protesters to \u201cget more confrontational\u201d if Chauvin were acquitted. The judge, Peter Cahill, refused to motion but criticised Waters and said she may have provided grounds for appeal.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you that Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned,\u201d he said.</p>"

One year later, they're winning</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But some prosecutors and law enforcement observers charge that departments carried out mass arrests as a crowd control tactic, as a means to silence peaceful protesters, and as a public relations strategy designed to turn the public against demonstrators by making them appear more violent than they were. And what\u2019s more \u2013 some of the citing officers never witnessed the protests in the first place.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt sends a message that you might get arrested if you express your views and first amendment rights,\u201d said Vera Eidelman, staff attorney with the ACLU\u2019s speech, privacy and technology project. \u201cPolice absolutely should not be relying on mass arrests to control a crowd or silence people who they disagree with.\u201d</p> \n<p>In most of a dozen jurisdictions examined, at least 90% of cases were dropped or dismissed. In some cities, like Dallas and Philadelphia, as many as 95% of citations were dropped or not prosecuted.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eb8153b2-f3ed-44bb-9f8b-777dec6a2179\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Overpoliced, underprotected is a series focused on police violence in the US following one of the largest-scale uprisings in history.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>A year on from the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, there are demands both inside the government and from grassroots movements to end the systemic racism and lethal force that has been embedded in police culture for centuries.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>But with stark differences in approaches to reform and revolution, and the continued power of police unions, achieving sweeping change faces more obstacles than ever.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In Houston, about 93% of citations were dropped; in Los Angeles, about 93% of citations were not filed. The prosecutor\u2019s office in San Francisco dismissed all 127 cases related to \u201cpeaceful protest-related charges\u201d, though data for more serious citations was not available.</p> \n<p>Officials did not file charges for nearly all low-level offenses, like disobeying curfews, while they most often pursued cases with strong evidence of more serious crimes, like assault or looting. Still, data shows that a majority of felony charges were also dropped, which some prosecutors said was due to a lack of evidence.</p> \n<p>The analysis does not include federal charges, and the figures are estimates that will change as the remaining cases play out in court. Police sent citations to a patchwork of agencies and departments in different cities where prosecutors, mayors or city attorneys largely made the call to drop charges.</p> \n<p>Mayors in every city except Detroit dropped all citations over which they had jurisdiction. The administration of Mayor Mike Duggan, a former prosecutor, pursued a high number of low-level misdemeanor charges or ordinance violations, even though the demonstrations were largely peaceful. But district court judge Larry Williams Jr <a href=\"https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2021/01/15/judge-drops-charges-against-28-black-lives-matter-protesters-in-detroit\">dismissed</a> more than 100 cases because police refused to provide basic evidence, such as body-cam footage.</p> \n<p>In most instances, Detroit officers who wrote tickets were not at the protests and didn\u2019t actually witness the alleged crimes, said the National Lawyers Guild and Detroit Justice Center attorney Rubina Mustafa. Instead of continuing to attempt to prosecute with shoddy evidence, the city earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2021/03/03/detroit-will-breathe-hearing-charges-dismissed/6905542002/\">dropped</a> nearly 300 more citations, but has still pursued dozens of charges against protest organizers. All told, 93% of Detroit cases have been dropped.</p> \n<p>Among those still facing charges is the Detroit Will Breathe organizer Tristan Taylor, who said the mass arrests across the country are \u201call about intimidation\u201d of people who vocally oppose police brutality: \u201cIt says something about the nature of policing when that\u2019s a uniform tactic.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01b4ef7d04096e4d3df35833e6e31909410e31d6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01b4ef7d04096e4d3df35833e6e31909410e31d6/0_0_4825_3085/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Officers arrest a protester near the police station in Detroit, Michigan, on 30 May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"639\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Officers arrest a protester near the police station in Detroit, Michigan, on 30 May 2020.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Seth Herald/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The mass arrests were also part of a public relations <a href=\"https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/why-isnt-detroit-the-nations-blackest-big-city-ready-for-criminal-justice-reform/Content?oid=25497324\">campaign</a> by Duggan and the Detroit police chief, James Craig, to paint the protesters as violent agitators and undermine their messaging, a strategy used by police in cities across the nation, said Tyler Crawford, the National Lawyers Guild director of mass defense.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat they try to do is spin it and say \u2018Look at how unlawful protesters are as is evidenced by all of these arrests that we\u2019ve made,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThen they hope people have stopped paying attention after six, 10, 12 months when prosecutors say, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got to drop these charges because these people shouldn\u2019t have been arrested.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>In Dallas, where more than 95% of cases were not filed, police represent an exception. The department <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/courts/2020/06/04/dallas-police-chief-renee-hall-says-protesters-who-marched-on-margaret-hunt-hill-bridge-will-not-be-charged/\">dropped</a> about 675 charges stemming from one protest because \u201cthe spirit of service to which the Dallas police department is committed would not be exemplified by moving forward with charges,\u201d leadership explained in an August <a href=\"https://dfw.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909545/2020/08/Final-After-Action-Report-1.pdf\">report</a>. Still, it sent nearly 200 charges to the prosecutor\u2019s office, of which about 85% were dropped or had not been filed as of September, though a department spokesperson did not know the outcome of eight cases.</p> \n<p>In Philadelphia, police sent over 1,700 charges to the city and the office of the district attorney, Larry Krasner. Mayor Jim Kenney and Krasner dropped or are poised to drop about 95% of the charges, including all ordinance violations. Krasner is handling a large portion of the more serious misdemeanors and felonies with a <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-unrest-restorative-justice-george-floyd-larry-krasner-20210326.html\">restorative justice program</a> that involves dropping charges upon completion of the program. It includes a mix of meeting with victims, community service and referrals to job and education programs. Only about 80 of the most serious charges have so far been filed.</p> \n<p>\u201cPolice were making arrests as a form of crowd control, so in many instances there were no criminal charges to file,\u201d a Krasner spokesperson, Jane Roh, said. \u201cIn other instances, there was simply not enough information to proceed on opening a criminal case.\u201d</p> \n<p>The number of dropped cases are also relatively high in cities that witnessed more violence. In Minneapolis, where Floyd was killed, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/us/protests-lawsuits-arrests.html\">more than 90%</a> of cases were dropped by November, though a local Black Lives Matter leader told the Guardian that hundreds of charges that police made since then remain in legal limbo. Portland has also seen recent violent clashes between protesters and law enforcement. Still, only <a href=\"https://www.mcda.us/index.php/protest-cases/\">15% of nearly 1,100 cases</a> have been filed and 82% have been rejected by the Multnomah county prosecutor, Mike Schmidt.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"750f5ab7127e66b6fa542717034a799e9283c87f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/750f5ab7127e66b6fa542717034a799e9283c87f/0_0_3936_2624/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Minneapolis state patrol arrest protesters on 7 October 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Minneapolis state patrol arrest protesters on 7 October 2020.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In New York City, more than 5,000 summonses that police wrote citywide for low-level offenses were dismissed by a summons court, according to the court\u2019s chief clerk. Though the precise percentage is unclear, the National Lawyers Guild attorney Gideon Oliver, who coordinated defense for many of those cited, said the \u201cvast majority\u201d, if not all, of summonses were or will be dismissed. Meanwhile, Brooklyn\u2019s prosecutor dropped 83% of 136 more serious criminal cases, and Manhattan\u2019s prosecutor dropped about 64% of nearly 1,000 cases.</p> \n<p>The mass arrests overwhelmed already strained criminal justice systems by forcing them to contend with processing thousands of protesters. That resulted in delayed arraignments and kept high numbers of inmates crowded in small New York jails for up to days at a time during the pandemic, Crawford said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe police response created this whole additional public health crisis that wasn\u2019t something people talked about much, but, in the moment, that was one of the biggest issues we were concerned about,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Moreover, forcing the criminal justice system to process thousands of cases based on flimsy evidence that probably would not result in prosecutions represented an enormous waste of tax dollars and time, observers said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what the government should be doing,\u201d Eidelman said. \u201cIt points to an excessive use of governmental authority.\u201d</p>"

And it has been some 300 days since the subsequent uprisings in their names. Thousands of protesters were arrested, and while the vast majority have had their flimsy charges dropped, there are many still facing harsher punishments than the officers who killed Taylor face.

Last year saw a total of 1,004 people shot to death by police, and while the majority of those people were white, Black people were still killed disproportionately to the total population. While some of these murders may seem \u201cjustified,\u201d it is important to remember that the US kills significantly more people than other countries of similar political and economic standing. For example, according to a 2015 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamiles-lartey/2015/jun/09/all\">Guardian report</a> by Jamiles Lartey, police killed 59 people in the US in the first 24 days of 2015, compared to 55 people killed in the last 24 years in England and Wales combined.

The uprising was framed by police departments as rioting and looting, but report after report has revealed that police across the country mishandled what were overwhelmingly peaceful protests. If anything, much of the violence this summer was arguably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-violent-rioters-america-police-officers\">triggered</a> by heavy-handed law enforcement who showed up with tanks, teargas and tactical shields. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/among-more-than-400-arrested-during-protests-in-the-district-most-cases-involve-curfew-violations-and-burglary/2020/06/14/ef7e2e82-ac93-11ea-94d2-d7bc43b26bf9_story.html\">14,000 protesters were arrested</a> within the first two and a half weeks of the initial uprising, and for months after, police continued to round up left-leaning organizers they sought to punish for the summer\u2019s activities. Thousands of those charges have since been dropped, with many more dropped each day, as it becomes clear that police and federal agents were more interested in political vengeance than evidence.

And while the federal government has made some efforts towards police reform, it is far from what many activists had hoped for, even including new potential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/04/the-george-floyd-act-wouldnt-have-saved-george-floyds-life-thats-says-it-all\">funding for police departments</a>.</p> <p>There has been good news, like the dropping of charges against Kenneth Walker, Breonna Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, and the first successful lawsuit against the city of Philadelphia for <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/philly-protests-lawsuits-settlement-nina-bryant-paul-hetznecker-20210316.html\">teargassing an entire Black neighborhood</a>. But these are unfortunately not the kind of victories that will fundamentally alter law enforcement in a way that can prevent future murders. For that, we will need organizations capable of redefining the very nature of the United States. And the country may very much need another uprising.</p> <ul> <li><p>Akin Olla is a Nigerian-American political strategist and organizer.

The world watched in horror <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/22/george-floyd-murder-change-across-world-blm\">one year ago</a> on Tuesday as the police officer Derek Chauvin placed his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck during an arrest and ignored his cries for help. After a summer of demonstrations nationwide, Chauvin went on to be one of the few police officers in the US to be prosecuted and convicted for killing a person while on duty.</p> <p>Demonstrations and marches are expected across the country throughout the week. The anniversary comes as the US Senate considers the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, the most ambitious police reform effort in decades. The legislation, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/03/george-floyd-justice-in-policing-act-us-house-democrats\">passed in the House</a> in March, would ban chokeholds and \u201cqualified immunity\u201d for law enforcement, which protects police officers from being personally sued by victims and their families for alleged civil rights violations.</p> <p>\u201cWe want something coming out of Washington.

The former president responded by siding with the rioters, saying they appeared to care more about overturning the election results than Republicans in Congress. McCarthy was desperate enough to then try the senior White House adviser, and Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to stop the attack after Trump ignored his pleas, according to a former administration source said.</p> <h2>In other news \u2026</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>The Biden administration will deal with \u201cthe grave humanitarian situation in Gaza\u201d</strong>, Blinken <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/23/us-antony-blinken-israel-gaza-biden-administration\">has pledged</a>, seeking \u201cequal measures of security\u201d for Israelis and Palestinians, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/20/israels-security-cabinet-approves-gaza-ceasefire-reports\">a ceasefire after 11 days of conflict</a> held throughout the weekend.</p></li> <li><p><strong>In Samoa, the clerk of the </strong><strong>legislative assembly locked the prime minister-elect and her supporters out</strong> of the parliament building to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/24/political-crisis-in-samoa-as-prime-minister-elect-locked-out-of-parliament-to-prevent-swearing-in\">prevent the swearing-in and transition of power</a>.

     "body": "<p>In March last year, life as we knew it in America changed. On 11 March, Donald Trump declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency. Two days later, police officers entered the home of Breonna Taylor and shot her to death. News of the former instantly shook the world. The latter took several months to command mainstream attention. Perhaps stories about her killing were lost in the noise of a world seemingly collapsing. Or perhaps we are conditioned to de-prioritize the brutality faced by Black women in America. One year later this is what I know for certain: we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/01/breonna-taylor-black-women-history-progress\">did not</a> and won\u2019t receive the justice that so many of us <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/10/the-next-reconstruction/615475/\">fought for</a> last year, but we can choose to honor Breonna Taylor by continuing our fight for Black women impacted by police violence \u2013 and for all vulnerable Black women in our community.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/29/breonna-taylor-louisville-officer-firing-no-knock-warrant\">Louisville officer could face firing over Breonna Taylor raid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Long before most of the world knew the name Breonna Taylor, the <a href=\"https://www.aapf.org/sayhername\">#SayHerName</a> campaign was launched to bring increased awareness to Black women killed by police. This campaign was created for the same reason it still must exist \u2013 out of necessity. According to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/investigations/police-shootings-women/\">reports</a>, 48 Black women have been fatally shot by police since 2015. Because of <a href=\"https://web.northeastern.edu/nulab/contesting-misognynoir-black-womens-digital-resistance-in-american-culture-with-moya-bailey/\">misogynoir</a> \u2013 the racism and sexism specifically experienced by Black women \u2013 these stories tend to get less media and public attention. If we are to honor the life of Breonna Taylor, then it is our obligation to call out misogynoir and speak clearly about why violence against Black women consistently attracts the least amount of attention in society. This should include incorporating and supporting Black women survivors in conversations about sexual violence at the hands of police officers. <a href=\"https://policecrime.bgsu.edu/Home/Crimes\">Research findings</a> indicate several hundred incidents of police officers in the United States arrested or charged with forcible rape between 2005 and 2013. As we know, sexual violence against women is likely <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/19/study-sexual-assaults-greatly-underreported-/3648197/\">incredibly underreported</a>. For Black women in particular, <a href=\"https://ujimacommunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Ujima-Womens-Violence-Stats-v7.4-1.pdf\">studies indicate</a> that \u201cfor every Black woman who reports rape, at least 15 Black women do not report.\u201d It seems fair to say that the number of Black women who experience sexual violence at the hands of the police is probably far greater than what we may imagine. The fight to honor the life of Breonna Taylor must include continuing a public, <em>nuanced</em> conversation around various forms of police violence against Black women. This must continue to happen even as we navigate incredibly complex injustices.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Black women do not have the luxury of choosing the atmosphere when we fight</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There will never be a \u201cconvenient\u201d time to fight for Black women. Nor will there ever be an opportunity to address <em>one</em> societal challenge at a time in reference to Black women. Black women are often required to fight while wounded. Despite often being victims of police violence, we are also the <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/herstory/\">key organizers</a> on the ground whenever there is a shooting of any unarmed Black person. We organize rallies and protest while simultaneously dealing with our own individual and collective afflictions. We risk our health to declare that Black lives matter in the midst of a pandemic. Acknowledging this fact is not meant to discourage other Black women from organizing and fighting for equity. Rather, it is more of a call to encourage others to fight with us and for us \u2013 even when it\u2019s not \u201cconvenient\u201d and happens to occur amid great change.</p> <p>Black women do not have the luxury of choosing the atmosphere when we fight. We can\u2019t wait for perfect conditions to fight against police violence. We fight come rain or shine. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s during the early stages of a pandemic or a year later as vaccinations bring greater hope.</p> <p>Twelve months ago, we were all trying to figure out how to navigate such great loss. A year later and we are on a path to some semblance of normalcy. Some are still mourning what we lost. Others are celebrating all that survived. Many are existing somewhere in-between \u2013 healing, hurting and enraged at knowing there is no vaccination from violence against Black women. For us, we will honor Breonna Taylor by helping to ensure her name will not be lost among the sound of a world reshaping into a new normal.</p> <ul> <li><p>Shanita Hubbard is an adjunct professor of criminal justice at Northampton Community College in Pennsylvania</p></li> </ul>"

It was intended to amuse his colleagues rather than cause offence, he said.</p> <p>The district judge, Jo Matson, ruled that though most people would be appalled by the image, the prosecution had not proved it was not meant simply as a joke.</p> <p>She said: \u201cAlthough I and the majority of people would find the image Mr Jones sent disgusting and grossly offensive, particularly given the timing of when it was sent and from a serving police officer to other police officers and, although I have found the image to be grossly offensive to the black and minority ethnic community, I find that the prosecution have not proved beyond reasonable doubt the mental element required for a conviction. They have not made me sure it was not intended as a joke by Mr Jones.\u201d</p> <p>His acquittal caused surprise among colleagues in the Devon and Cornwall force. One source said: \u201cIt\u2019s USA one, UK nil. That\u2019s unusual on issues of race. The US got it right, the UK got it wrong. There is surprise in the force.\u201d</p> <p>Plymouth magistrates court heard that the officer had forwarded the meme to a WhatsApp group of eight other people, including six police officers, after he received it from a friend. The meme featured Floyd\u2019s arrest in Minneapolis on 25 May, with an image of a naked American man, Wardy Joubert III, taking the place of Chauvin.</p> <p>Jones, who has served with the police for 23 years, was charged with sending a grossly offensive image contrary to the Communications Act 2003 after an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).</p> <p>Giving evidence at his trial, Jones said:\u201cMaybe I was after a cheap laugh or trying to raise a smile.\u201d<br></p> <p>The temporary assistant chief constable of Devon and Cornwall police, Steve Parker, said Jones remained suspended while an internal disciplinary process took place.</p> <p>The IOPC investigation said the \u201cperformance\u201d of two offices in the WhatsApp group fell short of expectations.</p> <p>A detention officer has received informal management action over their response to the message and a sergeant is subject to \u201creflective practice procedures\u201d for not reporting the matter straight away.</p> <p>Alex Raikes, the director of the charity Stand Against Racism &amp; Inequality, which is based in the south-west of England, expressed surprise and concern at the verdict.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThis sends the wrong message. We need our serving officers to know the gravity of sending out grossly offensive images, mocking atrocities that are happening to black citizens. This is one aspect of institutional racism \u2013 to belittle human rights breaches of minority ethnic communities.</p> <p>\u201cI find it incredible given the unmissable coverage on the murder of George Floyd and the pain it has caused, that this officer did not understand how deeply offensive and traumatic this image would be not just to members of the black and minority ethnic community but to all decent, law abiding members of British society.\u201d</p> <p>Weyman Bennett, the joint national secretary of Stand up to Racism, said: \u201cBritish justice has to be questioned much more than American justice today. I don\u2019t believe that racism is a matter of a joke or a gaffe.\u201d</p> <p>The community activist Desmond Jaddoo, who is working with the family of a black man who died after being arrested in Devon, said: \u201cOn a day when the world has seen a slight change, I see this as a setback in this country in terms of race relations.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who murdered George Floyd, has been sentenced to 22 years and six months for second-degree murder, closing one chapter of a case that thrust the issue of race and American policing back into the global spotlight.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/05/winston-boogie-smith-jr-minneapolis-deputies-protests\">Protests erupt in Minneapolis over man fatally shot by deputies</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The 45-year-old appeared in court on Friday, dressed in a grey suit and with a shaved head, two months after a jury found him guilty on three charges related to Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>The sentence, issued by the Hennepin county judge Peter Cahill, was a 10-year increase to the state\u2019s recommended sentencing guidance for second-degree murder. Prosecutors successfully argued that Chauvin should face harsher sentencing due to a range of aggravating factors.</p> \n<p>Cahill offered only brief remarks before delivering the sentence, saying his decision was \u201cnot based on emotion or sympathy\u201d but adding: \u201cI want to acknowledge the deep and tremendous pain that all the families are feeling, especially the Floyd family.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cahill explained his reasoning for the harsher sentence in a 22-page sentencing memorandum released by the court, <a href=\"https://www.mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/High-Profile-Cases/27-CR-20-12646/MCRO_27-CR-20-12646_Sentencing-Order_2021-06-25_20210625145755.pdf\">writing</a>: \u201cPart of the mission of the Minneapolis police department is to give citizens \u2018voice and respect\u2019. Here, Mr Chauvin rather than pursuing the MPD mission, treated Mr Floyd without respect and denied him the dignity owed to all human beings and which he certainly would have extended to a friend or neighbor.\u201d</p> \n<p>The announcement followed victim impact statements from members of the Floyd family including his seven-year-old daughter Gianna. In a recorded video message, she was asked what she would say to her father today.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt would be I miss you and I love him,\u201d she said. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a3419bc-ca21-444c-a129-db974820d580\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7Z4AXlHBtJw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Prosecutors sought a maximum sentence of 30 years, a plea reiterated by members of the Floyd family as they delivered statements in person.</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery day I have begged for justice to be served, reliving the execution of George, while others begged, they pleaded for officer Chauvin to simply just allow George to take a breath,\u201d Floyd\u2019s brother Philonise told the court. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a real night\u2019s sleep because of the nightmares I constantly have hearing my brother beg and plead for his life over and over again.\u201d</p> \n<p>Terrence Floyd, another of George Floyd\u2019s brothers, directly addressed the former officer, who sat before him showing little visible emotion.</p> \n<p>\u201cI wanted to know from the man himself, why? What were you thinking? What was going through your head when you had your knee on my brother\u2019s neck.

However, we have a long way to go and many changes to make before Black and brown people finally feel like they are being treated fairly and humanely by law enforcement in this country.\u201d</p> \n<p>Under Minnesota \u201cgood behaviour\u201d law, Chauvin could serve only two-thirds of the sentence in prison with the rest under licensed release. Earlier on Friday, judge Cahill rejected a motion by defence attorneys for a new trial.</p> \n<p>Chauvin\u2019s attorney, Eric Nelson, requested the court issue a probatory sentence only.</p> \n<p>Chauvin spoke briefly to the court, suggesting that \u201cadditional legal matters\u201d prevented him from speaking at length.</p> \n<p>\u201cVery briefly though, I want to give my condolences to the Floyd family, there\u2019s going to be some other information in the future that would be of interest, and I hope some things would give you some peace of mind,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Chauvin\u2019s mother, Carolyn Pawlenty, asked for the court to show restraint and said, despite the unanimous guilty verdicts on second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter, that her son was innocent. She did not address the Floyd family.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy son\u2019s identity has also been reduced to that \u2026 as a racist,\u201d she said. \u201cI want this court to know that none of these things are true and that my son is a good man.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cThe public will never know the loving and caring man he is, but his family does. Even though I have not spoken publicly, I have always supported him 100% and always will.\u201d</p> \n<p>Floyd\u2019s death, on 25 May 2020, ignited racial justice protests around the US and the world. Chauvin\u2019s trial was seen as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-guilty-verdict-george-floyd-analysis\">a litmus test for police accountability</a>.</p>"

Zero charges for the three police officers who fired 32 bullets in the early morning raid that killed Breonna Taylor, hitting her six times.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/07/us-cities-defund-police-transferring-money-community\">These US cities defunded police: 'We're transferring money to the community'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It has been a long, painful year for Taylor\u2019s family, and for Louisville, a city straddling the American midwest and south once known for its college basketball prowess and the annual Kentucky Derby. </p> <p>It is now more readily identifiable as the city where Taylor was shot and killed by police a year ago Saturday.</p> <p>At first, Taylor\u2019s death drew little notice. The 26-year-old Black ER tech was described as a suspect who was killed as police returned fire. Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, was arrested for firing a single shot from his pistol, hitting an officer in the leg as they breached the door. He later said he believed he was witnessing a home invasion and that the police did not identify themselves.</p> <p>Taylor\u2019s family and friends tried to raise awareness about her killing, but as Kentucky and the nation braced for the pandemic shutdown, they struggled to get the public\u2019s attention.</p> <p>Back then it would have seemed unlikely that her name would become one of the most recognizable in America. That the jerseys NBA and WNBA players wore on court would exhort fans to say her name. That her face would be on billboards put up by Oprah Winfrey. That a presidential candidate would mention her on the debate stage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b283e505a01d6e2d076626c62c99fc119ad1693b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b283e505a01d6e2d076626c62c99fc119ad1693b/0_357_5393_3238/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People gather in Jefferson Square in Louisville to await word on charges against police officers in the death of Breonna Taylor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People gather in Jefferson Square in Louisville to await word on charges against police officers in the death of Breonna Taylor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darron Cummings/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When videos of the killings of the killings of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd surfaced, Taylor\u2019s death started to garner wider attention. Then, on 28 May \u2013 two days after protests began in Minneapolis over George Floyd\u2019s killing \u2013 a 911 call by Taylor\u2019s boyfriend was made public.<strong> </strong>In it, a sobbing Walker appeared to not know it was the police who had shot into the apartment. The phone call was seen as a contradiction of the police\u2019s cut and dry version of events and people were outraged. Mass protests erupted immediately.</p> <p>It was a watershed moment for Louisville, dividing its history into a before and an after.</p> <p>\u201cFor so long, across the country but specifically honing in on Louisville, you had people who were trying to pretend to be oblivious to the obvious,\u201d said Timothy Findley Jr, a protest leader and pastor at the Kingdom Fellowship Christian Life Center in Louisville. \u201cThe inequities have always been there \u2026 But 2020, it pulled the cover off and it wouldn\u2019t allow people to pretend as if they didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>These days in Louisville, Black Lives Matter signs are ubiquitous on lawns in predominantly white neighborhoods. The mayor declared racism a public health crisis. Debates over inequity, inequality, segregation, white privilege and reforming the city\u2019s controversy-ridden police force are abound.</p> <p>So far, three officers have been fired from the police force for actions relating to Taylor\u2019s death. In June, it was announced that the detective Brett Hankison would be fired for \u201cwantonly and blindly\u201d firing 10 shots into Taylor\u2019s apartment while showing \u201can extreme indifference to the value of human life\u201d. In January, two more firings: the det Myles Cosgrove, who then police chief Yvette Gentry said fired 16 rounds without acquiring a target and failed to turn on his body camera, and the detective Joshua Jaynes, who Gentry wrote displayed \u201cuntruthfulness\u201d in applying for a warrant for Taylor\u2019s apartment.</p> <p>In September, the city agreed to pay Taylor\u2019s family $12m to settle a civil suit. As part of the settlement, the city promised a slew of police reforms, including measures that would screen potentially problematic officers, build relationships with local communities and put more controls on how warrants are obtained and served.</p> <p>But calls for justice \u2013 which, to most protesters, means charges against the officers involved in Taylor\u2019s killing \u2013 have not yet been answered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b41c171a1a9c6d60135e34a654e59280a5155ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b41c171a1a9c6d60135e34a654e59280a5155ff/0_0_2000_1567/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Breonna Taylor in an undated photo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"784\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Breonna Taylor in an undated photo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After months of investigation, on 23 September Kentucky\u2019s Republican attorney general, Daniel Cameron, announced that no charges would be filed by the state against police officers for the killing of Taylor. One officer, Hankison, received three charges of wanton endangerment for shots he fired that went into a neighboring apartment. To many, it felt like punishment was only being dealt for shots that missed.</p> <p>Later, jurors<strong> </strong>would come forward to say that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/20/breonna-taylor-grand-juror-homicide-charges\">wanton endangerment charges</a> were the only charges they were presented to consider.</p> <p>\u201cIt was incredibly frustrating because you watch so many people for so long fight so hard to make sure that Breonna Taylor got a fair shake just to see that it was basically predetermined,\u201d said Sam Aguiar, an attorney for Taylor\u2019s family. \u201cIt made me wonder how much has actually changed since the 1960s.\u201d</p> <p>While the state has not charged the officers involved in the raid, an FBI investigation into potential civil rights violations surrounding Taylor\u2019s death remains ongoing.</p> <p>Aguiar said he is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about federal charges as those investigators do not have a \u201cpolitical agenda\u201d like Kentucky\u2019s attorney general.</p> <p>Large protests are expected on Saturday to mark the first anniversary of Taylor\u2019s killing and continue calls for justice.</p> <p>In a press conference Thursday, Taylor\u2019s mother, Tamika Palmer, called on the Jefferson county commonwealth\u2019s attorney, Tom Wine, to bring charges against the officers.</p> <p>\u201cIt really ain\u2019t that hard,\u201d she said. \u201cTom Wine, you got a job to do.

While that bill has been tabled, a bill from Kentucky\u2019s Republican senate president that limits, but does not outright ban, no-knock raids <a href=\"https://wfpl.org/republican-bill-limiting-no-knock-search-warrants-advances/\">was passed by the state\u2019s senate on Wednesday</a> and now heads to the house of representatives.</p> <p>But events of the past year have also inspired bills that would punish protesters and prevent their goals from being enacted. One bill would <a href=\"https://wfpl.org/ky-bill-criminalizes-insulting-police-enhances-penalties-and-jail-time-for-protest-related-crimes/\">make insulting or taunting a police officer a criminal offense</a> and ensure that law enforcement budgets cannot be lowered. Another would give the office of Kentucky\u2019s attorney general \u2013 whose home was repeatedly picketed by demonstrators last year - the ability to level charges at protesters.</p> <p>The direction Louisville goes from here in a large part depends on the Louisville metro police department (LMPD).</p> <p>In the aftermath of the Taylor\u2019s death, the department has introduced a series of reforms, among them: mandating that body cameras be worn while executing warrants, limiting the use of teargas and encouraging officers to actually live in the community where they work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5f853bf89c5f7e2959c365a9bad79c476d7ff696\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f853bf89c5f7e2959c365a9bad79c476d7ff696/0_126_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In this image from video, a Louisville Metro Police Department office stands guard outside the home of Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron as protestors sit in his front yard in Louisville, Kentucky Tuesday, July 14, 2020.

     "body": "<p>Northern Ireland\u2019s most senior police officer has apologised over the handling of Black Lives Matter protests in Belfast and Derry during the pandemic lockdown earlier this year.</p> <p>The chief constable, Simon Byrne, issued the apology on Tuesday after a report for the police ombudsman in the region found the policing of the rallies in the two cities had been unfair and discriminatory.</p> <p>The ombudsman\u2019s report into the Police Service of Northern Ireland\u2019s operation at the Black Lives Protest in June concluded that confidence among ethnic minority communities in policing had been \u201cseverely damaged\u201d.</p> <p>The PSNI issued up to 70 people with \u00a360 fines at the two demonstrations.</p> <p>Critics have compared the PSNI\u2019s attitude towards the BLM protesters with the alleged inaction of police to deal with a far larger breach of the lockdown rules last summer when thousands of republicans took to the streets of west Belfast to attend the funeral of the leading IRA figure Bobby Storey. Among the mourners at the funeral was the Sinn F\u00e9in deputy first minister, Michelle O\u2019Neill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2b2ac11c899113ad57576ac6fe097e8d5e5d901\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2b2ac11c899113ad57576ac6fe097e8d5e5d901/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Byrne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Byrne at a coronavirus briefing in Belfast in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kelvin Boyes/Press Eye/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The chief constable recently admitted that the PSNI took no similar action against the large crowds at the Storey funeral over fears it would have provoked widespread public disorder. The PSNI announced last week that its investigation into the numbers gathered at the Storey funeral had been completed and a file sent to the Public Prosecution Service.</p> <p>Black Lives Matters supporters have pointed out that no fines were handed to loyalists and military veterans attending a mass rally to \u201cProtect our Monuments\u201d also held in June.</p> <p>In his statement, Byrne said: \u201cWe tried our best to respect the public health requirements of the Northern Ireland executive to save lives and at the same time deal with public outcry triggered by this awful death [of George Floyd in the US].</p> <p>\u201cWe operated within the legal framework available to us at the time, but the ombudsman is clear that whilst unintentional, we got that balance procedurally wrong.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt is clear to me that some members of the black and minority ethnic community have been frustrated, angry and upset by our policing response and our relationship with them has suffered.</p> <p>\u201cFor that I am sorry, and I am determined in that regard to put things right.\u201d</p> <p>Marie Anderson, the police ombudsman, said the PSNI\u2019s decision to move against BLM protesters in Derry and Belfast was not based on race or ethnicity.</p> <p>Anderson said, however, that the PSNI had \u201cfailed to fully understand the human rights of those at the Black Lives Matter (BLM) events to be able to protest peacefully\u201d.</p> <p>The police ombudsman\u2019s report stated: \u201cThe differential treatment by PSNI of protesters on 6 June when compared with those attending Protect our Monuments on 13 June gave rise to claims of unfairness and discrimination against those persons who organised and attended the Black Lives Matter protests.\u201d</p> <p>Gerry Carroll, the leader of the leftwing People Before Profit party and a member of the Northern Ireland assembly, said the findings of the 90-page report showed there was a \u201csource of shame\u201d among Stormont politicians who had backed the PSNI\u2019s actions against BLM activists.</p> <p>Carroll said the justice minister, Naomi Long, and O\u2019Neill, the deputy first minister, had defended the PSNI\u2019s handling of the protest as \u201cproportionate\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThese findings indicate what Black Lives Matters activists have been saying all along; that the PSNI crackdown on 6 June represented a damaging and indefensible breach of human rights. We call on the parties to immediately apologise to the Black Lives Matter protesters, and for all fines and threats of prosecution to be dropped immediately.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Joe Biden will on Tuesday meet the family of George Floyd on the first anniversary of his murder by police in Minneapolis \u2013 but miss his own deadline for police reform to address racial injustice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/24/los-angeles-black-lives-matter-police-unions\">Can Black Lives Matter LA dismantle the powerful police unions?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The private meeting at the White House comes amid events in Minneapolis and beyond to mark one year since Floyd was killed when police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes.</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s dying words, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, became a rallying cry for an international racial justice movement and demands for radical changes to policing. But to the frustration of activists, efforts have hit a wall in Washington.</p> <p>Biden dropped a campaign promise to create a national police oversight commission in his first hundred days in office, reportedly after being advised by civil rights organisations and police unions that it might cause unnecessary delays.</p> <p>Instead the president told a joint session of Congress last month he wanted the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed by 25 May. The legislation would invest in police training, ban the use of chokeholds and establish a national database of police misconduct.</p> <p>The bill has been passed by the House of Representatives but is stalled in the Senate over issues including qualified immunity, which shields law enforcement officers from being sued by victims and their families for civil rights violations. Republicans have objected to it being scrapped.</p> <p>Both parties acknowledged on Monday that they will not meet Biden\u2019s self-imposed deadline but insisted they can still find common ground.</p> <p>The Democratic senator Cory Booker, Republican counterpart Tim Scott and Democratic congresswoman Karen Bass said in a joint statement: \u201cThis anniversary serves as a painful reminder of why we must make meaningful change. While we are still working through our differences on key issues, we continue to make progress toward a compromise and remain optimistic about the prospects of achieving that goal.\u201d</p> <p>The White House played down the disappointment at failing to meet expectations. Cedric Richmond, a senior adviser, told MSNBC: \u201cThe president called for it by the anniversary but meaningful talks are still going on and it\u2019s better to have a meaningful bill than worry about a deadline.\u201d</p> <p>Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters last week: \u201cAll of the negotiators are continuing to press forward on working to find common ground to get this done. The president wants to sign it into law.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not going to slow our efforts to get this done, but we can also be transparent about the fact that it\u2019s going to take a little bit more time. Sometimes that happens, that\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> <p>Biden has been criticised for his support of a 1994 crime bill that led to the incarceration of thousands of Black men and women for drugs offences. But he performed strongly with African American voters in last year\u2019s election and promised to embed racial equity in his legislative agenda.</p> <p>The president took an unusually keen interest in the trial of Chauvin, a white former Minneapolis police officer, telling reporters as the jury considered its decision: \u201cI\u2019m praying the verdict is the right verdict, which is \u2026 I think it\u2019s overwhelming in my view.\u201d</p> <p>Chauvin was found guilty of murder and is awaiting sentencing.</p> <p>Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, told the Hill the last year pushed Biden \u201cout of the 1990s mentality of centrism and toward a deeper understanding of institutional racism\u201d.</p> <p>Zelizer added: \u201cThe combination of Trump, with his endless appeals to white backlash politics, and a movement that insisted public policy must change at basic levels, moved him into a new place intellectually, The question is, how does it translate into an agenda?\u201d</p> <p>The George Floyd Memorial Foundation, a non-profit launched by Floyd\u2019s siblings in September to fight racial inequality, is hosting a series of events in Minneapolis this week.</p> <p>Family members took to the streets on Sunday and marched with hundreds of people. Many carried signs with pictures of Floyd and other Black people killed by police.</p> <p>His sister, Bridgett Floyd, told the crowd: \u201cIt has been a long year. It has been a painful year. It has been very frustrating for me and my family for our lives to change in the blink of an eye \u2013 I still don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p> <p>Other speakers at the event included a Floyd family lawyer, Ben Crump, and the civil rights activist the Rev Al Sharpton, who said: \u201cWe want something coming out of Washington. We want something that will change federal law. There\u2019s been an adjournment on justice for too long. It\u2019s time for them to vote and make this the law.\u201d</p> <p>Sharpton added: \u201cGeorge Floyd should not go down in history as someone with a knee on his neck, but as someone who broke the chain of police brutality and illegality.\u201d</p> <p>Other events in Minneapolis to mark the anniversary include a virtual \u201cday of action\u201d that encourages people to organise remotely and two panels with family members and other activists on Monday, followed by a community festival and candlelight vigil on Tuesday.</p> <p>In New York on Sunday, Floyd\u2019s brother, Terrence, attended a gathering in Brooklyn organised by Sharpton. Terrence Floyd told supporters not to forget his brother or victims of racist violence.</p> <p>\u201cIf you keep my brother\u2019s name ringing, you\u2019re going to keep everybody else\u2019s name ringing,\u201d he said. \u201cBreonna Taylor, Sean Bell, Ahmaud Arbery, you could go through the whole list. There\u2019s a lot of them.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>When Donald Williams II saw the police car, he debated continuing on his way. He\u2019d snuck out of his place on 25 May 2020 for a few minutes\u2019 break from his family \u2013 just a quick hop to Cup Foods for an energy drink, something Williams had done countless times before. It had been a productive day of fishing on Valentine Lake with his 13-year-old son. They planned to fillet and cook the three bass they had caught for dinner; Williams didn\u2019t want to keep his son waiting. He\u2019d haphazardly thrown on his navy blue Northside Boxing hoodie and two mismatched socks that peaked conspicuously out of his flip-flops. He wasn\u2019t dressed for a serious interaction.</p> \n<p>Williams made it to the convenience store door before he stopped in his tracks.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy energy stopped me,\u201d Williams explained to a jury nine months later at Derek Chauvin\u2019s trial for the murder of George Floyd. \u201cThe surroundings stopped me. The energy was off and I just couldn\u2019t get in the door.\u201d</p> \n<p>The 33-year-old Williams moved to the sidewalk hugging the convenience store to observe the situation, something he\u2019d learned working corporate and private security for more than a decade. A police car was pulled up to the curb with an officer standing at its rear side. A Black man was on the ground, stomach down, his wrists handcuffed behind his back. A second officer had his left knee on the side of the man\u2019s neck, pinning him to the concrete alongside the vehicle.</p> \n<p>The man struggled to raise his head, his face contorted in pain. He was in obvious distress. He was George Floyd and his murder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-protests-what-we-know-so-far\">would set off a summer of protests</a> and racial reckoning in the United States and across the world.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/24/chauvin-verdict-george-floyd-verdict\">The Chauvin verdict is a step in the right direction. But there is much work to do | Rev Al Sharpton</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Williams, who had lived in Minneapolis all his life, joined two other bystanders at the edge of the sidewalk, now just feet away from the police car\u2019s rear side. </p> \n<p>Floyd told the officer kneeling on his neck, Derek Chauvin, that he couldn\u2019t breathe. He asked for his mother. Chauvin didn\u2019t respond. Williams quickly realized he had come upon a life-or-death situation.</p> \n<p>Williams identified himself to the officers as a trained fighter with the local Minnesota Mixed Martial Arts Academy. Why this would make a difference has everything to do with William\u2019s athletic skillset. As a professional fighter who had drilled chokeholds for a decade, Williams was a crucial eyewitness at Chauvin\u2019s trial for the murder of Floyd. Williams was able to explain to the jury how Chauvin\u2019s knee created the same pressure to Floyd\u2019s neck as a side choke, which cuts off blood circulation and oxygen to the brain, causing its recipient to lose consciousness.</p> \n<p>A lifelong wrestler understands weight and leverage, which is how Williams could articulate that every time Chauvin adjusted his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck, it had the same effect as a fighter tightening a hold on their opponent. Every shift of Chauvin\u2019s shoulders, of his planted back foot \u2013 Williams explained the correlation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"03cd6120-227f-4b6b-b113-e2ac965a8346\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0t2l1r_5jHk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Williams started wrestling at age 12, not knowing that his father had been an Illinois state wrestling champion years before. A state qualifier multiple years, Williams continued to wrestle through college. In 2009, Williams discovered MMA at Greg Nelson\u2019s Academy in Brooklyn Center. Williams was one year away from a dental hygienist\u2019s degree when he decided to train full-time under Nelson, a former NCAA Division I wrestler who has produced three UFC champions.</p> \n<p>As an amateur bantamweight, Williams rattled off six consecutive wins in five months. Williams had a 6-6 record as a pro, his last bout a loss in March 2019 in which he tore a ligament in his knee. One year later, Williams found himself on the sidewalk outside Cup Foods, his studied eyes acutely aware of what he as witnessing.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was able to focus and analyze on what was happening because of my martial arts training. It moved fast for everyone, but it was slow for me,\u201d Williams told the Guardian last week. \u201cAll these comments [Floyd] made or someone else said, it triggered things in my brain. I knew the reason why things were happening [with Floyd].\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cMy head hurts,\u201d Floyd said, according to Williams\u2019s testimony, as Chauvin\u2019s knee remained wedged in his neck. \u201cMy head hurts,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI need to get up.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s a blood choke,\u201d Williams yelled out to the officers. Blood chokes restrict the blood flow from and to the brain and cause targets to pass out. Law enforcement officers trained in these types of chokes at the Academy alongside Williams all the time. Maybe one would recognize its meaning \u2013 and danger. Chauvin looked up and he and Williams made eye contact. The officer never looked Williams\u2019 way again.</p> \n<p>Minutes passed as Williams tried different ways to get Chauvin to release his knee. Frozen on the sidewalk, Williams called the officers \u201cbums,\u201d as he watched Floyd\u2019s eyes rolling in the back of his head.</p> \n<p>About a dozen spectators had now gathered on the sidewalk. Williams noticed a young man exit the store, walk around the crowd to get a better vantage point and break down crying before being ushered back into the store. When the teenager came back out a second time, Williams talked him out of confronting the police.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time or place,\u201d Williams told him, holding his arm up stop him.</p> \n<p>As Floyd faded in front of his eyes, Williams intensified his pleas to the officers. He had studied anatomy in college and understood time was running out.</p> \n<p>\u201cJust like in MMA, you can tell when someone is getting tired or getting choked out,\u201d Williams said at the trial. \u201cI could see the man\u2019s breathing becoming tremendously heavier and you could see and hear him struggling to gasp for air.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy stomach hurts,\u201d Floyd said. It was the last thing Williams heard him say. Seconds later, Williams saw him go lifeless.</p> \n<p>As the ambulance drove away, Williams didn\u2019t know what to do with himself. Nervous and feeling lost, he did something no one thinks they\u2019d ever need to do. Williams called the cops on the cops, telling the operator that he\u2019d just witnessed a murder.</p> \n<p>William\u2019s girlfriend and kids were upset with worry when he returned home. \u201cI left the house for what I thought would be five minutes, but I was gone for over two hours,\u201d said Williams</p> \n<p>A shaken Williams tried to explain to his family the gravity of what he\u2019d just been a part of, but he struggled to find the words. He retreated to the basement and waited for the story to hit the media. Williams doesn\u2019t know how much time passed before he heard the basement door creak open. \u201cYou can come up now,\u201d a family member called down. \u201cWe believe you.\u201d</p> \n<p>For the next nine months, Williams waited to share what he had witnessed. He declined most interviews, limited public appearances and stopped participating in social media altogether. If he was recognized, Williams always steered conversation away from Floyd\u2019s death \u2013 steps taken to preserve his testimony and protect himself and his family. Floyd\u2019s death has taken a mental toll on Williams and his family.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m dealing with stuff, with trauma,\u201d he told the Guardian of the effect the murder and trial has had on his life. \u201cWe all are. Everyone who watched that. We\u2019re all dealing with it. It\u2019s trauma.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked if the last year had left him fearful for his safety, Williams was blunt. \u201cAm I fearful for my safety? Of course, I\u2019m fearful for my safety,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a Black man in America.\u201d</p> \n<p>Williams likened the time leading up the trial to preparing for a fight \u2013 he wanted to make sure he could perform to the best of his ability as a witness in order to achieve justice for Floyd.</p> \n<p>When he took the stand in March for Chauvin\u2019s trial, Williams had a lot of information to share \u2013 more than 20 years\u2019 worth to be exact. There were a dozen witnesses to Floyd\u2019s murder, but only one with a trained eye for \u201cuse of force,\u201d the term used to describe the tactics an officer uses to subdue a suspect. Last week, Chauvin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">was found guilty of Floyd\u2019s murder</a>.</p> \n<p>Williams is expected to testify in the combined trial of the three other officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death. That trial begins on 23 August. Williams intends to be fight-ready.</p> \n<p><br></p>"

The crime for which he was taken into custody was paltry: possession of .03g of crack cocaine worth $10, a strikingly similar amount to the counterfeit $20 bill for which he was arrested and then killed in May last year.</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s 2004 arrest was made on the word of one officer, Gerald Goines, who wrote in police records that the Black man tried to sell him the cocaine in an undercover sting. A second suspect was not arrested, Goines wrote, \u201cin a attempt to further the narcotic trafficking in this area\u201d \u2013 he meant in order to turn the other man into an informant, but as the clemency petition notes, \u201chis phrasing on the offense report was inartful\u201d.</p> <p>Now Goines himself stands charged with furthering narcotic trafficking in Houston \u2013 and of murder. A year before Floyd was killed in Minneapolis, in early 2019, Goines led a \u201cno-knock\u201d drug raid in which a couple living in a Houston house, Dennis Tuttle and Rhogena Nicholas, were killed.</p> <p>Prosecutors allege Goines, 56, lied to obtain the warrant to search the couple\u2019s home by claiming a confidential informant bought heroin there. Goines later said there was no informant and he bought the drugs himself, they allege.</p> <p>The former police officer faces felony murder and other charges.</p> <p>As prosecutors delved into the Goines case, a vast number of convictions in which he was involved began unravelling. More than 160 convictions have been dismissed, and more than 10 current and former officers from the city\u2019s narcotics unit, including Goines, have been indicted. More cases are pending.</p> <p>The Houston public defender\u2019s office argues in its clemency petition that Floyd\u2019s 2004 arrest falls into the same pattern as many of those dismissed convictions. Goines, the allegation goes, made up the confidential informant in order to nail him.</p> <p>\u201cNo one bothered to question the word of a veteran cop against that of a previously convicted Black man,\u201d Allison Mathis, leading the pardon appeal, writes in the <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2021/01/21/greg-abbott-police-funding-reforms/\">250-page application</a>.</p> <p>\u201cGoines manufactured the existence of confidential informants to bolster his cases against innocent defendants, consistent with the unnamed, unidentified \u2018second suspect\u2019 he mentions in his offense report in his interaction with George Floyd.\u201d</p> <p>Mathis goes on to describe the legal trap in which Floyd then found himself, with no chance to press his innocence.</p> <p>\u201cIf Floyd had gone to trial, he would have faced punishment enhancements that would have branded him a habitual offender and could have sent him to prison for a minimum of 25 years.\u201d</p> <p>And so Floyd pleaded guilty to a crime he almost certainly hadn\u2019t committed, and served 10 months in jail.</p> <p>The public defender makes an impassioned plea for a pardon. Posthumous clemency would not give Floyd back the months he spent behind bars, away from his children and mother, nor erase the impact of the sentence on his later life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/apr/26/donald-williams-witness-george-floyd-mma\">How MMA fighter Donald Williams helped achieve justice for George Floyd</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn its own small way, though, this pardon would correct the record. It would show that the state of Texas is interested in fundamental fairness, in admitting its mistakes \u2026 From heat we get light, and change does come.\u201d</p> <p>The request now goes before the state\u2019s board of pardons and paroles. Should the panel approve it, the final decision will fall to Greg Abbott, the Republican governor of Texas, who steers a <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2021/01/21/greg-abbott-police-funding-reforms/\">hard line</a> in favor of law enforcement officers and against reforms designed to address police brutality.</p> <p>\u201cI definitely think Georgie deserves it,\u201d Floyd\u2019s friend Tiffany Cofield said of the pardon in an interview with a local TV station, <a href=\"https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/george-floyd/posthumous-pardon-george-floyd-2004-drug-charge/285-d07f5cf6-8bfb-486d-ac57-ec7fcf0568cb\">Khou 11</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThings could have been so different for him. That one stint in jail, that could have been a difference-maker. This would almost be like vindication.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Like some sort of subversive enlightenment, 2020 has revealed a number of unpalatable truths about our world. But perhaps the most uncomfortable moments of the year came when we looked inwardly at ourselves and the relationships we have with others.</p> <p>I speak from personal experience when I say that 2020 has been defining for me. As an African American woman married to a white British man, the racial unrest that unfolded globally over the summer after the killing of George Floyd at the hands of the police catalysed a number of frank and difficult discussions in my own personal circles that led to great change.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/29/george-floyd-death-fuelled-anti-racism-protests-britain\">Black Lives Matter movement</a> brought hidden racial biases within many countries to the forefront \u2013 countries that vehemently denied racism was ever a problem, just a far-fetched thing that happens \u201cover there in America\u201d.</p> <p>But for me, it also ignited some difficult conversations at home. The racial aspect of my interracial relationship was always in the back of my mind. And while racism wasn\u2019t a central topic at the beginning of our relationship, it certainly became one in 2020. For a long while, my husband couldn\u2019t understand, let alone appreciate, just how different the path I tread is from his own, even as we walk together hand in hand through life as husband and wife.</p> <p>I think we were so focused on understanding each other\u2019s personalities and quirks in the beginning of our relationship that we didn\u2019t really talk about race \u2013 and I\u2019ve come to learn we absolutely should have. Race is a part of our identity, and for any mixed-race relationship to work I think it\u2019s absolutely vital to know each person\u2019s view on all aspects of racism.</p> <p>Yes, our marriage has love and mutual respect at its core, but the vast disparities in our life experiences could have driven us apart. At times I needed support and empathy but instead my husband assumed I might have played a part in provoking others who I believed targeted me based on the colour of my skin. \u201cMaybe they were having an off day,\u201d he would say, and that sounded like he was defending a complete stranger. And while there have been other white people who doubted my experiences with racism, I expected my husband to be the opposite: the one person who believes I am the most reliable witness to my racial experiences.</p> <p>He did not recognise racism where racism existed, only identifying it when the offence was clear as daylight. Nor could he grasp why I was so affected by the highly publicised deadly moments of racism in the US that led to the widespread protests. Little did he know that, as a Black woman who has been assaulted and spat at simply because of the colour of my skin, I go about life in a constant state of survival.</p> <p>So how did we move beyond our worldly differences to come back stronger together?</p> <p>It started from accepting that much could be learned if only we actively and fearlessly listened to one another. And we started to explore our racial differences, we found ourselves diving into unfamiliar waters. We analysed our experiences as a mixed-race couple and we found that defensiveness and gaslighting can surreptitiously impinge on the loving space, shutting down empathic listening and meaningful conversations.</p> <p>I realised that I was asking my husband to suddenly grasp nuances of my experience as a Black woman that I had never required of him before. I had to learn to simply accept that there are some things that he will never totally understand. He realised that he\u2019ll always be coming from a place of learning when it comes to race. We had to both realise and admit our limitations. That\u2019s a hard thing to do. But our relationship became better because of it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/25/married-romantic-relationship-husband-solidarity\">This year, I took a leap of faith and married someone I\u2019d only met three times | Ellie Mae O\u2019Hagan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This year was an opportunity for many interracial couples to reaffirm their love and support for one another in the face of intolerances, both covert or otherwise. Or perhaps it was a reality check for a few \u2013 a realisation that, in some cases, a difference in lived experiences can be just too much even for love to reconcile.</p> <p>A fear of change is natural. But for me, the fear of maintaining the status quo is worse. I believe we\u2019ve passed that. This crazy year has changed me. It has catalysed conversations between people. It has challenged my marriage and made it stronger; it has sharpened my sense of purpose in life, and it has helped me see that I must use my voice and speak up.</p> <p>And as 2020 draws to a close, I take comfort in the signs that times will change. Truly understanding our differences is not supposed to be a short and simple journey. It has the ability to unite us and strengthen relationships \u2013 if only we\u2019re able to honestly admit what divides us first.</p> <ul> <li><p>Tineka Smith is co-author with Alex Court of <a href=\"https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Mixed-Up-Audiobook/B08JMF7ZJ4?qid=1608222465&amp;sr=1-1&amp;ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&amp;pf_rd_p=c6e316b8-14da-418d-8f91-b3cad83c5183&amp;pf_rd_r=N1T9MD7RETF78W1BA0AX\">Mixed Up: Confessions of an Interracial Couple</a>, which is available on Audible</p></li> </ul>"

It was so sad that we had to meet that way, and that our families connected in that way.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c2ee4997af44d2aa354112b40e7244a5d46636ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2ee4997af44d2aa354112b40e7244a5d46636ea/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katie Wright, center right, the mother of Daunte Wright, is embraced by George Floyd\u2019s girlfriend, Courteney Ross, center left, in Minneapolis on 13 April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katie Wright, center right, the mother of Daunte Wright, is embraced by George Floyd\u2019s girlfriend, Courteney Ross, center left, in Minneapolis on 13 April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leila Navidi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The city of Minneapolis had been on edge before the shooting of Daunte Wright, with National Guard troops lining the downtown area and the county courthouse encased in a mesh of concrete barriers and barbed wire, but Wright\u2019s death tipped tensions over the edge.</p> <p>\u201cThis just added gasoline to the fire,\u201d said Quinn Redeemed, a 46-year-old protester, stood outside the Brooklyn Center police department on Monday after the first night of unrest. Her Black Lives Matter flag swayed in the wind, pounded by icy rain. \u201cWe are tired and fired up.\u201d</p> <p>Now, with closing arguments in the Chauvin murder trial set for Monday, perhaps the most significant murder trial in the history of American policing seems set to conclude within days as the prosecution of another officer merely begins. The fate of Derek Chauvin will soon lie in the hands of 12 jurors, and their decision will have ramifications not just in this American midwestern city, but around the world.</p> <h2>\u2018Murder, it was murder\u2019</h2> <p>It was 12.15 on Monday afternoon when police in Brooklyn Center released body camera footage showing the moment Daunte Wright was killed. Officer Kim Potter, a 26-year veteran of the force, took part in a traffic stop, which police say started because Wright\u2019s car had an expired license plate.</p> <p>The blurry footage shows a brief scuffle between Wright and two officers. She pulls out her Glock handgun and shouts \u201cTaser!\u201d three times, before firing a bullet. \u201cOh shit, I shot him,\u201d she says as the car speeds away.</p> <p>At a media briefing in the police department headquarters to mark release of the footage, police chief Tim Gannon argued the shooting was \u201can accidental discharge\u201d with officer Potter mistaking her gun for a Taser. But in a waiting area next door, where a small group of activists had assembled and watched on their phones with the Guardian present, the reaction was more visceral.</p> <p>\u201cMurder, it was murder,\u201d Jonathan Mason, a community organizer, shouted over and over again after watching the fatal shot, disbelieving it was possible for a seasoned officer to mistake a bright yellow Taser electroshock weapon for a black pistol.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9bf4b104fb7593f9e9954ddc9509315df00f661a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9bf4b104fb7593f9e9954ddc9509315df00f661a/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators gather in front of the Brooklyn Center police department on 16 April to protest Daunte Wright\u2019s death by former police officer Kim Potter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators gather in front of the Brooklyn Center police department on 16 April to protest Daunte Wright\u2019s death by former police officer Kim Potter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Octavio Jones/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two hours later, and nine miles down the road at the Hennepin county courthouse, George Floyd\u2019s younger brother Philonise was among the last of 38 witnesses to testify for the prosecution against Derek Chauvin.</p> <p>Through tears <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-death-absolutely-preventable-doctor-testifies\">he told the jury</a> how his brother had led their household as a child, how much he had loved his mother, and how much he was missed.</p> <p>\u201cHe just was like a person everybody loved around the community. He just knew how to make people feel better,\u201d Floyd said in the sterile courtroom, broadcast live across the world. That afternoon the prosecution concluded, with many observers describing it as the most overwhelming case against a former police officer they had ever seen.</p> <p>A number of senior Minneapolis police officers, including the chief of police, had testified against their former colleague, numerous medical experts attested that Chauvin\u2019s use of a nine-minute and 29-second knee-to-neck restraint had been the primary cause of Floyd\u2019s death, and many eyewitnesses spoke powerfully about their ongoing trauma having watched George Floyd die.</p> <p>But as the prosecution in the Chauvin case rested on Monday, the fate of officer Potter remained distinctly unclear.</p> <h2>\u2018Police officers don\u2019t have to fight fair\u2019</h2> <p>Police in the United States <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/counted-us-police-killings\">kill roughly 1,100 people a year</a> with only a tiny proportion of those cases resulting in criminal prosecution for the officers involved. Between 2005 and 2019, <a href=\"https://www.bgsu.edu/content/dam/BGSU/health-and-human-services/document/Criminal-Justice-Program/policeintegritylostresearch/-9-On-Duty-Shootings-Police-Officers-Charged-with-Murder-or-Manslaughter.pdf\">according to research</a> at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, 104 police officers were arrested for murder or manslaughter with just 35 convicted of a crime.</p> <p>The statistics reflect the difficulty that prosecutors face in convicting American police officers, who often benefit from significant union protection, different legal standards over the use of fatal force and implicit bias borne of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/31/ties-that-bind-conflicts-of-interest-police-killings\">conflicts of interest</a> within the US criminal justice system.</p> <p>The concern around securing a conviction in the Chauvin case was evident when Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison announced charges against the four officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death, who cautioned it would take months to bring the case to court.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason thoroughness is important is because every single link in the prosecutorial chain needs to be strong. Trying this case will not be an easy thing. Winning a conviction will be hard,\u201d <a href=\"http://ktoe.com/2020/06/03/ellison-warns-receiving-convictions-in-the-george-floyd-case-wont-be-easy/\">he said in June last year</a>.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s defence began <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/13/minneapolis-police-protesters-clash-second-night-death-daunte-wright-brookyln-center\">after another night of unrest</a> on the streets of Minneapolis. A phalanx of officers beat their riot shields and fired volleys of teargas into the crowds who chanted Daunte Wright\u2019s name. Keith Ellison himself appeared on the streets as police cleared most demonstrators shortly before midnight.</p> <p>He spoke directly to those who remained. \u201cThis thing [Wright\u2019s death] is not going to be swept under the rug. We\u2019re going to deal with it in a real way,\u201d he assured them.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning, shortly after 9am, the defence began calling its first witnesses. Their argument throughout has essentially been to blame Floyd\u2019s death on his own heart problems and drug use, and suggest that Chauvin\u2019s use of a prolonged restraint was a justifiable use of force. They need only one juror to side with them to force a mistrial, as any conviction must be a unanimous decision.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9109a061dfa9062bcc9d1d40544b44fc015cac6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9109a061dfa9062bcc9d1d40544b44fc015cac6b/0_0_5956_3971/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A memorial to George Floyd has a new addition commemorating Daunte Wright in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A memorial to George Floyd has a new addition commemorating Daunte Wright in Minneapolis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Minchillo/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The defence called a use of force expert, Barry Brodd, a former California officer with a notorious past. Brodd previously testified in defence of the white officer, Jason Van Dyke, who shot and killed black teenager Laquan McDonald in 2014. Van Dyke opened fire 16 times and Brodd told the jury in that case that each shot was a justified use of force. Many were fired while McDonald lay dying on the floor.</p> <p>Throughout his testimony on Tuesday, Brodd argued that Chauvin\u2019s use of restraint had been proportionate to the threat that the unarmed man, unconscious for more than four minutes, posed to officers.</p> <p>\u201cI felt that Derek Chauvin was justified, and was acting with objective reasonableness,\u201d he told jurors. \u201cPolice officers don\u2019t have to fight fair. They\u2019re allowed to overcome your resistance by going up a level.\u201d</p> <p>During a break in Brodd\u2019s testimony, as a snow storm pounded the grounds of the courthouse, the Floyd and Wright family met for the first time, embracing in tears. Naisha Wright, Daunte\u2019s aunt, chanted her nephew\u2019s name as she wore a T-shirt with George Floyd\u2019s image.</p> <p>\u201cMy nephew\u2019s blood is on your hands \u2026,\u201d she said, her body shaking. \u201cHold her [Potter] accountable. Hold her higher than accountable.\u201d</p> <p>As she was speaking, news came that both Kim Potter and police chief Tim Gannon had resigned from the force.</p> <h2>\u2018Can we get a conviction?\u2019</h2> <p>The death of George Floyd <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/mar/11/andrea-jenkins-first-black-transgender-woman-us-public-office-minneapolis-george-floyd\">prompted significant police reform efforts in the city of Minneapolis</a>. The city council voted for police budget cuts and to redirect significant funds, $8m, to create new mental health teams that will be able to respond to certain 911 calls. The city also approved a landmark settlement with the Floyd family of $27m.</p> <p>Asked if Daunte Wright\u2019s death had set these reform efforts back, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey was frank: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to course-correct 400 years of systemic oppression in one single policy, or in any one single effort,\u201d he said in a statement to the Guardian.</p> <p>It was the middle of Wednesday morning when prosecutors announced that Kim Potter would face manslaughter charges over the death of Daunte Wright, less than four days after he was killed.</p> <p>The defence in the Chauvin case had called their final witness: forensic pathologist David Fowler. He told the jury that it was George Floyd\u2019s heart conditions, his drug use and potentially carbon monoxide poisoning from the exhaust of a patrol car that had killed him.</p> <p>Fowler, who trained in apartheid South Africa, is being sued by the family of a Black teenager, Anton Black, in Maryland, who died after three police officers held him face down in 2018. Fowler ruled that Black had died from \u201cnatural causes\u201d prompting the American Civil Liberties Union <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-maryland-comment-former-maryland-medical-examiner-defending-police-killings\">to accuse him</a> of being \u201ccomplicit in creating false narratives about what kills Black people in police encounters\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8a6eb2c620b50a4bf2df3566f3814cdce57b79ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a6eb2c620b50a4bf2df3566f3814cdce57b79ca/0_0_4922_3281/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstrator protests the fatal shooting of Daunte Wright outside the Brooklyn Center police department on 16 April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A demonstrator protests the fatal shooting of Daunte Wright outside the Brooklyn Center police department on 16 April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Minchillo/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the stand, the pathologist cast doubt on Floyd\u2019s official autopsy, which ruled his death a homicide, stating he had, in fact, determined it was \u201cundetermined\u201d.</p> <p>Chauvin\u2019s defence announced they intended to call no further witnesses on Thursday, bringing the trial into its closing stages.</p> <p>Hours after the court went into recess, Daunte Wright\u2019s family emerged into the public once more, the beginning of their legal journey just starting.</p> <p>The family\u2019s attorney, Benjamin Crump, who also represents the Floyd family, expressed frustration that prosecutors had not charged Potter with third degree murder. But he reeled off a list of other unarmed Black men and boys, killed by police in recent years with the officers never criminally charged.</p> <p>Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Eric Garner in New York City. Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long journey to justice,\u201d Crump said. \u201cWe have to remember, not so long ago they weren\u2019t charging any police officer for killing a Black person. So we\u2019re making progress in America. Are we at a point where we can say it\u2019s equality? Oh, we\u2019re a long way from that.\u201d</p> <p>Naisha Wright could not contain her anger.</p> <p>\u201cJustice? What is justice? Will we get to see Daunte\u2019s smile? We don\u2019t get to see that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe highest accountability? I know the highest is going to be judged by God. But can we get a conviction?\u201d</p> <p>Both families will still have to wait and see.</p>"

     "body": "<p>How different is the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s Africa policy going to be from Donald Trump\u2019s, or even Barack Obama\u2019s? Many African people, as well as the continent\u2019s strongman leaders, are now gingerly asking \u2013 is Biden going to be Obama 2.0, or Trump-lite?</p> <p>For the sake of black lives mattering everywhere in these turbulent times, I hope Biden will chart a bold new course, diametrically away from not only Trump but also Obama\u2019s Africa policy.</p> <p>I welcomed the Biden presidency with a deep sigh of relief. Yet I am still worried about his Africa strategy. Relations between president-elect Biden and African people will kick off with tensions and apprehensions \u2013 understandably so.</p> <p>For the past 60 years, Democrat and Republican presidents have approached Africa primarily for access to, and control of, our extractive industries and, at certain points, for counter-terrorism operations. This approach, under the influence of the cold war, translated into the US supporting Africa\u2019s strongmen, leaving vulnerable people struggling to survive their ruthlessness, while China cheered from the sidelines.</p> <p>The most prominent of these strongmen, including but not limited to Equatorial Guinea\u2019s Teodoro Obiang Nguema, in power since 1979; Uganda\u2019s Yoweri Museveni, head of state since 1986; Djibouti\u2019s Ismail Omar Guelleh, in post since 1999; Rwanda\u2019s Paul Kagame, ruling since 1994, and Eritrea\u2019s Isaias Afwerki, in power since 1993. The human cost of US support for these men has been jarring for even the most cynical observers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HEUJtN7ucC4tXhgnWHi0jS3trnGgk_na_UZCEaq0mNM/edit?usp=sharing\">By my calculation</a> Africa\u2019s strongmen have been responsible for more than 22 million deaths on the continent since independence in 1960. That is almost twice as many people as <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/transatlantic-slave-trade\">historians say</a> were forcibly transported from Africa during the transatlantic slave trade. Yet it seems no US president has found this troubling.</p> <p>The bloodiest<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/sunday-review/congos-never-ending-war.html\"> </a>killing field has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/sunday-review/congos-never-ending-war.html\">the Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, where brutal US-backed strongmen <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/irc-study-shows-congos-neglected-crisis-leaves-54-million-dead\">killed more than 5.4 million </a>Congolese people over access and control of minerals between 1998 and 2008, and sparked outbreaks of disease, famine and the use of rape as a weapon of war. </p> <p>With Trump out of the picture, our biggest fear is a repeat of Obama\u2019s Africa doctrine \u2013 and for many black people this is the single biggest concern about the Biden-Harris administration.</p> <p>As we all know,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/11/obama-visits-ghana-african-model\"> President Obama promised Africa </a>one thing in Ghana in 2009: to support strong institutions instead of strongmen. That simple pledge \u2013 repeated, in one form or another \u2013 felt very personal to many of us fighting for peace and change.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>During the Obama presidency, 11 African strongmen clung to power, killing thousands of their citizens</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But Obama <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/03/opinions/obama-failed-in-africa-tampa-opinion/index.html\">delivered almost nothing meaningful</a>; not because of a Russian or Chinese veto at the UN security council but because <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/world/un-envoy-rice-faulted-for-rwanda-tie-in-congo-conflict.html\">in the first few years of his presidency </a>some in his team sought to protect people such as Joseph Kabila, former president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, whose security forces were linked to killings and torture, and Paul Kagame, whose tight grip on the Rwanda presidency has earned him the tag of \u201cbenevolent dictator\u201d.</p> <p>The result? Tragic. During the Obama presidency, 11 African strongmen clung to power, killing thousands of their citizens and displacing millions more. Yet almost not a single one of them faced a serious tit-for-tat consequences from the US \u2013 and this has been a colossal disaster for democratic forces across the continent.</p> <p>Trump, too, turned a blind eye to atrocities in Africa.

     "body": "<p>A majority of people believe Black Lives Matter, the anti-racism movement that spread across the UK this summer, has increased racial tension, according to a poll.</p> <p>Just over half (55%) of UK adults believe the BLM protests that took place in big cities but also in the Shetland Islands and the Isle of Wight, increased racial tensions, according to a survey of more than 2,000 people by pollsters Opinium. Only 17% of the people polled in October disagreed. The polling also showed 44% of ethnic minorities felt BLM increased racial tensions.</p> <p>The findings, which BLM organisers said showed the movement has exposed existing fault lines, comes alongside parallel research indicating sharp rises in the number of black people saying they faced discrimination in the last year, rising from 74% in 2019 to 81%. In a possible sign of racism arising from the origin of Covid-19 in Wuhan, the proportion of Chinese people saying they faced discrimination over the same period rose from 68% to 76%, according to polling carried out in June.</p> <p>Opinium\u2019s annual survey of multicultural Britain also found that 71% of Asian people had suffered discrimination or abuse because of their ethnicity, rising to 81% among black people.</p> <p>\u201cA particularly worrying find is that the majority of BAME people have faced discrimination because of their race and ethnicity,\u201d said Mete Coban, the director of My Life My Say, a youth-led charity aimed at increasing engagement with democracy. \u201cAnother saddening finding is that 46% of BAME people have faced discrimination on multiple occasions, which is an increase from last year.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2020-11-27T11:18:15/embed.html\" data-alt=\"BLM chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2020-11-27T11:18:15/embed.html\">BLM chart</a> </figure>  <p>White people were more likely to believe that the BLM movement, which was given fresh momentum by global outrage at the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May, had increased racial tensions, Opinium found. Those citing that concern most were Conservative voters, with 78% saying they believed it had inflamed tensions and just 6% saying it hadn\u2019t.</p> <p>Race relations experts point out that senior Conservatives attacked BLM in forthright language, with the former chancellor Sajid Javid saying last month it was \u201cneo-Marxist\u201d and \u201cnot a force for good\u201d. Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, has urged schools not to support the \u201cpolitical\u201d movement in lessons.</p> <p>Asked about the survey, Adam Elliott-Cooper, a spokesman for BLM, said racial tensions in Britain long preceded the movement and that it had highlighted the issue.</p> <p>\u201cTo say that to challenge racism increases racial tension is a very misleading assumption,\u201d he said. \u201cBlack Lives Matter hasn\u2019t increased racial tension in the same way as the civil rights movement in the US didn\u2019t or the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa didn\u2019t. They haven\u2019t increased racial tension but they might have made it more apparent and exposed what is there.\u201d</p> <p>The resurgence of the BLM movement this year triggered a series of actions, which many felt were overdue, but others found controversial. These included the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/15/edward-colston-statue-replaced-by-sculpture-of-black-lives-matter-protester\">dumping of a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston</a> into Bristol\u2019s dock, and a wave of investigations into British institutions\u2019 slavery links. A 2017 book by Reni Eddo-Lodge called Why I\u2019m No Longer Talking to White People About Race, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/16/reni-eddo-lodge-first-black-british-author-top-uk-book-charts-why-i-m-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race\">shot back up the bestseller charts</a>.</p> <p>Prof Kalwant Bhopal, director of the Centre for Research in Race and Education at the University of Birmingham, said the results suggested BLM had made some white people \u201cfeel their privilege is being threatened and questioned\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they see something like BLM they do what they can to protect it and there is a backlash,\u201d she said. She added that the response of some institutions, such as universities, to pledge support for the goals of BLM, had created a \u201cmask of inclusion\u201d which obscured a reluctance to deliver real change. This was seen by some minority ethnic people as evidence of division, she said.</p>"

The legislation, which would bring about the most significant changes to policing on the federal level, would ban the use of chokeholds and establish a national database of police misconduct.</p> <p>\u201cWe want something coming out of Washington. We want something that will change federal law,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cThere\u2019s been an adjournment on justice for too long. It\u2019s time for them to vote and make this the law.\u201d<br></p> <p>The program of events marking the first anniversary has been organized by the George Floyd Memorial Foundation, a non-profit organization founded by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/22/bridgett-floyd-george-sister-interview-congress-law\">Bridgett Floyd</a>.</p> <p>The events will also include a number of roundtable discussions featuring activists and family members of other Americans killed by police, including Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who was killed by New York City police in 2015, and Katy and Aubrey Wright, the parents of Daunte Wright, who was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb last month.</p> <p>Floyd was placed in a fatal knee-to-neck restraint by Chauvin in May last year. The incident was captured on video by a number of bystanders and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/22/george-floyd-murder-change-across-world-blm\">sent shockwaves around the world</a>. Last month Chauvin was convicted of second-degree murder and two other felonies and faces up to 40 years in prison. Three other officers involved in the arrest are awaiting trial.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the first anniversary of Floyd\u2019s death, Joe Biden will meet the Floyd family at the White House as negotiations continue in Congress over police reform legislation. The foundation will also host a \u201ccelebration of life\u201d event at a downtown park in Minneapolis.</p> <p>\u201cWe will celebrate the life and legacy of George Floyd through Black culture, art, history and support of local businesses,\u201d organizers said, adding there will be performances from a number of local and \u201cGrammy award-winning artists\u201d.</p> <p>On Friday the foundation awarded a $25,000 scholarship to Fayetteville State University, a historically Black college in North Carolina.</p> <p>Bridgett Floyd presented the check to the university and said: \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about \u2013 generational stamps. We need to put things in place for our kids\u2019 kids. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here to do.\u201d</p> <p>During an address to Congress last month, the president had said he wanted major police reform legislation on his desk by Tuesday, but negotiations are still far from a resolution.</p> <p>One of several <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/05/22/biden-floyd-police-reform-deadline-490206\">sticking points</a> on the bill, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/03/george-floyd-justice-in-policing-act-us-house-democrats\">already passed the Democrat-held House</a>, is the issue of ending qualified immunity, which protects police officers from being personally sued by victims and their families for alleged civil rights violations. While ending or restricting qualified immunity is largely seen as a must-have for police reform advocates, it is staunchly <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/14/police-reform-police-unions-qualified-immunity-democratic-party-420122\">opposed by police unions</a>.</p> <p>\u201cMy concern is, and I\u2019ve communicated this to the White House, is that we come with a toothless bill to meet a hard deadline,\u201d Sharpton, president of the National Action Network, told <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/05/22/biden-floyd-police-reform-deadline-490206\">Politico</a>. \u201cI\u2019d rather have a bill with teeth late than a toothless bill on time.\u201d</p> <p>Since Floyd\u2019s killing, at least 17 states, including Minnesota, have enacted legislation to ban or restrict the use of chokeholds and neck restraints by police officers, according to data provided to the Associated Press by the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p> <p>Before then, only two states, Tennessee and Illinois, had bans on such police hold techniques. A majority of the bans enacted over the past year are in states controlled politically by Democrats.</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>"

Breonna Taylor\u201d and \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d.</strong> Posters and shrines dedicated to Taylor were seen all around as protesters marched.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Two police officers in Louisville were shot and suffered non-life-threatening injuries.</strong> Louisville police have one suspect in custody, but it is unclear whether the suspect and the shooting were related to protests in the city. One officer is undergoing surgery while the second is alert and stable.

One person was detained.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Taylor\u2019s mother, Tamika Palmer, learned of the charging decision minutes before attorney general\u2019s announcement. </strong>The family\u2019s attorney, Sam Aguiar, told CNN: \u201cShe had to drive all the way down there to be told this, despite two advanced requests from me to not force her to drive down only to learn no indictments.\u201d </p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Former Louisville police officer Brett Hankinson faces three felony counts of first-degree wanton endangerment</strong>. None of the other officers involved in the fatal shooting were indicted. No homicide charges were issued.

The arc of the moral universe does not bend on its own. It is bent in the right direction by protesters, campaigners and dissenters. It was their hands that forced it towards justice last week, when the former police officer Derek Chauvin was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">found guilty</a> of the second-degree murder of George Floyd. We cannot celebrate and take comfort in the verdict that was meted out without acknowledging the action outside the courtroom that secured it.</p> <p>But this is what some will do: claim the verdict to be a great victory, after denigrating the means by which it was achieved. The protests in the wake of Floyd\u2019s murder have been called the largest <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html\">in US and global history</a>. They reached more than 50 countries. In the US, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/black-lives-matter-90-million-finances-8a80cad199f54c0c4b9e74283d27366f\">tens of millions of dollars</a> were raised and invested in grassroots communities and advocacy in a diffuse, decentralised network that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/us/protest-personal-homes-doxxing.html\">lobbied politicians</a> and pushed through <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/voter-registration-surged-during-blm-protests-study-finds-n1236331\">voter registration</a>. It all made a deep impression on the public consciousness. Chauvin quite simply would not have been brought to trial on these charges, let alone been convicted, were it not for these tireless efforts.</p> <p>What will now unfold is an exercise in whitewashing, erasing those unruly, non-state actors from the history of the Chauvin verdict. His conviction will be framed as something that came about as a result of the integrity of the justice system. His crime will be seen as a policing malfunction that was caught, unfortunately too late for George Floyd, but in time for the US to learn and move forward. \u201cThank you, George Floyd, for sacrificing your life for justice,\u201d said Nancy Pelosi, after the verdict was announced. Floyd here is merely a passive martyr whose death gave the system an opportunity to redeem itself.</p> <p>But the system doesn\u2019t work. And more importantly, it wouldn\u2019t have worked had officialdom been trusted. From the moment a teenager\u2019s mobile phone camera began recording, when Floyd was being restrained, the evidence of Chauvin\u2019s crime was crowdsourced. The original police report, which called his death a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/george-floyd-police-report-murder-b1834832.html\">medical incident</a>\u201d, gives a chilling insight into the different path the case might have taken had there been no footage. The media then did its own citizen\u2019s investigation, unearthing Chauvin\u2019s long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-killing-officers-derek-chauvin-tou-thao-investigated\">record of complaints of misdemeanours</a>. The moral outrage for the murder did not come from politicians. It was brought to their doors by a movement of people who knew that, within the legal system, the dead Floyd would likely have no advocates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/22/derek-chauvin-verdict-police-race-us\">There\u2019s hope for racial justice in America. But it comes from the people \u2013 not the courts | Simon Balto</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some of those politicians are now shimmying to catch a bit of Floyd\u2019s halo. The New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, said that \u201cjustice was served\u201d after \u201cthe reality of racism in this nation finally hit a boiling point\u201d. But he <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-york-mayor-bill-de-blasio-defends-police-after-video-n1220246\">defended police</a> driving into protesters<strong> </strong>who had reached that boiling point, saying that it was \u201cinappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers\u201d. In the UK, Boris Johnson \u201cwelcomed\u201d the verdict, after spending last summer urging people not to support Black Lives Matter demonstrations, which he decided were \u201cin all probability going to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/jun/12/boris-johnson-we-should-not-support-black-lives-matter-protests-churchill-statue-video\">end in violence</a>\u201d.

Black lives matter</a>\u201d, seemingly forgetting that last year he said the organisation was \u201cnot a force for good\u201d and demanded protesters \u201c<a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/sajid-javid-protesters-police-chant-downing-street-a4456206.html\">show some goddamn respect</a>\u201d.</p> <p>But this is how progress is won: by not showing goddamn respect. It isn\u2019t handed over by the benign powers that govern us, but wrested from their hands through protest, riots and civil disobedience. Chauvin\u2019s conviction was not the only legal consequence of last year\u2019s mobilisations. From forcing Emmanuel Macron to put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/09/emmanuel-macron-announces-police-reform-consultation\">reform of the French police</a> on the table to catalysing <a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/06/the-philadelphia-inquirers-journalists-of-color-are-taking-a-sick-and-tired-day-after-buildings-matter-too-headline/\">change in newsrooms</a> in the US, the consequences were manifold. This type of dissent is responsible for many of the rights we all enjoy today, from universal suffrage in the UK to civil rights for black people in the US.</p> <p>But there is a broader reason why the protests were being written out of history the moment they began to have an impact. As such movements gain momentum, their reach becomes impossible to contain. The charge that Black Lives Matter is a radical movement is correct. For it to achieve its goals, for racial equity to be achieved, a wholesale rethinking of power relations \u2013 between boss and employee, border guard and migrant, ruler and ruled \u2013 must take place. A grand redistribution of wealth is essential. A fallen statue is not about a mindless moment of anger, it is a demand to fundamentally and honestly rethink a particular country\u2019s history and sense of self.</p> <p>The uncomfortable truth is that change comes about in ways that are disruptive and, yes, occasionally unsavoury. Those events are then sanitised and their significance minimised, so we can maintain a naive trust in the arc of history and those who govern us. Every legal system is as flawed and institutionally skewed as the country in which it exists. In the UK and the US, it has inbuilt biases in favour of the police and those who can afford the best legal representation. Those who cannot afford it, from marginalised communities, are subject to criminalisation, becoming forever felons in the eyes of the state.</p> <p>But the justice system is also sensitive to public opinion and the political environment, and its outcomes are often an interplay between external pressures and internal deficiencies. Accountability for George Floyd\u2019s death may have been delivered in a courtroom, but it began in the streets.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"

They\u2019re going to kill me.\u201d</p> \n<p>Blackwell said that Floyd was no longer breathing for the last minute that Chauvin was kneeling on his neck.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor said that the officer not only failed to fulfill his legal duty to help Floyd but stopped anyone else from assisting him, including a firefighter trained in first aid.</p> \n<p>Blackwell said that even when Chauvin was told by a paramedic that Floyd no longer had a pulse, the police officer kept his knee in place.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see that he does not let up. He does not get up. Even when Mr Floyd does not even have a pulse, it continues on,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He said the jury will hear testimony from a police officer who arrived on the scene while Floyd was held down who will say that at that point there was no need for the force used by Chauvin.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor also said that the Minneapolis police chief, Medaria Arradondo, who fired Chauvin shortly over Floyd\u2019s death, will testify that the former officer\u2019s conduct was \u201cnot consistent\u201d with Minneapolis police department training or protocol.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe will tell you it\u2019s excessive force,\u201d Blackwell said.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor said that Floyd\u2019s arrest was unnecessary in the first place as passing a counterfeit bill, even if intentional, is a misdemeanour for which the police could have written a ticket.</p> \n<p>Nelson said in his opening statement that he will show that his client\u2019s behaviour was reasonable under the circumstances because Floyd was under the influence of drugs at the time of his arrest.</p> \n<p>He said witnesses testify that Floyd had taken opioid pills shortly before he was detained and that at times he \u201cpassed out\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe evidence will show that when confronted by police, Mr Floyd put drugs in his mouth in order to conceal them from police,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Nelson said that Floyd took a \u201cspeedball\u201d of opioids and methamphetamine, and that as a result he was struggling violently against arrest which necessitated use of force.</p> \n<p>\u201cDerek Chauvin did exactly what he had been trained to do over his 19-year career,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The outcome of the trial may well centre on the cause of death.</p> \n<p>Nelson said medical evidence will show the presence of drugs as well as other medical issues including coronary disease and an enlarged heart were the cause of death. He said there is no medical evidence of asphyxiation.</p> \n<p>The official autopsy and an independent autopsy at the time concluded that the main cause of death was homicide.</p> \n<p>Blackwell said: \u201cThis was not a heart attack.\u201d</p> \n<p>The first prosecution witness was a 911 dispatcher, Jena Scurry, who told a police supervisor she was concerned at seeing the officers \u201csat on this man\u201d in a live feed from a street camera.</p> \n<p>Blackwell said of Scurry\u2019s testimony that \u201cshe called the police on the police\u201d.</p> \n<p>Later in the afternoon, prosecution witness Donald Williams, 33, told how he watched Floyd \u201cslowly fade away\u201d from close by, even as bystanders implored and berated the police holding him.</p> \n<p>Williams told the court that he could hear and see Floyd in distress and his martial arts experience indicated to him that Chauvin was choking out Floyd as he kneeled on his neck.</p> \n<p>The jury, and the public watching in court or around the world by livestream, was shown some devastating clips of Chauvin allegedly \u201cshimmying\u201d in what Williams said was a martial arts move, altering his position very slightly so that it put more pressure on \u2013 as a fighter does when they have someone in a hold.</p> \n<p>Williams heard Floyd talking about how much pain he was in, his distress as he said he couldn\u2019t breathe, apologized to the officers and begged for his life.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe more that the knee was on his neck, and the shimmying going on, the more you see him [Floyd] slowly fade away. His eyes rolled to the back of his head,\u201d Williams said.</p> \n<p>He described Floyd dying \u201clike a fish in a bag\u201d.</p> \n<p>Williams described the knee-position as a dangerous \u201cblood choke\u201d intended to cut Floyd\u2019s airway.</p> \n<p>Williams has previously been heard but unseen shouting angrily at the police from the sidewalk, calling Chauvin a \u201cbum\u201d and accusing him of enjoying what he was doing, as Floyd suffers and begs.</p> \n<p>The trial continues.</p>"

The most serious charge the former Minneapolis officer is facing in Floyd\u2019s death is second-degree murder, but the jury might choose to find him guilty on third-degree murder or manslaughter, or acquit him altogether.</p> <p>Chauvin has pleaded not guilty to murder and manslaughter charges, arguing that he was following the training he received during his 19 years on the force.</p> <p>Benjamin Crump, a civil rights attorney representing the families of Floyd and Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old shot to death in Brooklyn Center, a suburb of Minneapolis, by a white police officer during a traffic stop on 11 April, as the Chauvin trial played out, said a guilty verdict for Chauvin could set a precedent in the US.</p> <p>\u201cThe outcome that we pray for and Derek Chauvin is for him to be held criminally liable for killing George Floyd, because we believe that could be a precedent,\u201d Crump told ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday. \u201cFinally making America live up to its promise of liberty and justice for all.

In an apparent change in police tactics from earlier in the week, officers did not appear en masse to confront protesters. The police headquarters was shielded behind a double layer of fencing. Minnesota\u2019s governor, Tim Walz, had spoken out earlier on Saturday, calling the reports of police violence towards journalists at Brooklyn Center earlier in the week \u201cunacceptable\u201d.</p> <p>Dozens of American news organizations had <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20618268-mn\">signed on to a letter on Saturday </a>outlining \u201cwidespread intimidation, violence and other misconduct directed at journalists\u201d who have been covering the protests in Minnesota, including the treatment of a CNN reporter who was thrown to the ground and arrested.

However, we still have issues of racism and the disproportionate use of police powers against black, Asian and minority ethnic communities.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cThe NBPA will continue to push the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) on fulfilling their commitment to race through their action plan. We hope this conviction acts as a catalyst to drive actions that are much needed right now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some officers resent comparisons to US law enforcement, believing the UK style of policing by consent to be wholly different from that of their armed American counterparts, with British officers warier of using any force, let alone deadly force, and police chiefs insist officers are fully accountable for their actions.</p> \n<p>However, Inquest, which monitors state related deaths, disputes that stance. The charity said that since 1990, juries at inquests had returned nine unlawful killing verdicts involving the police and there was one unlawful killing finding recorded by a public inquiry into a police shooting, as well as other critical findings of force used. None have led to manslaughter or murder convictions.</p> \n<p>Deborah Coles, director <a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/bame-deaths-in-police-custody\">of Inquest, </a>said: \u201cLegal accountability for individuals and institutions responsible for deaths is essential, but is something few families Inquest works with ever see.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/19/eye-watering-top-police-officer-laments-rate-of-stop-and-search-on-young-black-men\">'Eye watering': top police officer laments rate of stop and search on young black men</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cDespite a pattern of cases of unlawful use of force, ill-treatment and neglect, particularly involving black men, no police officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/17/blm-uk-to-fund-peoples-tribunal-for-deaths-in-custody\">involved in a death </a>has been found guilty of murder or manslaughter for over 30 years. Bereaved families in this country are consistently failed by a legal framework characterised by flawed investigations, victim blaming, institutional delay, denial and defensiveness resulting in a culture of impunity.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis issue is not about a few bad police officers, it\u2019s about systemic racism and state violence.\u201d</p> \n<p>In January, the Guardian revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jan/18/fewer-than-one-in-10-police-officers-fired-after-gross-misconduct-finding\">fewer than one in 10 British police officers</a> found to have potentially committed gross misconduct by the police watchdog are dismissed.</p> \n<p>Martin Hewitt, chair of the NPCC, promised reforms following Chauvin\u2019s conviction: \u201cThe legitimacy of UK policing is built on relationships between the police and the public, but levels of trust and confidence are<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/dec/17/black-people-five-times-more-likely-to-be-subjected-to-police-force\"> significantly lower among some black people</a> and racial disparities exist that we cannot fully explain.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are in the process of developing a plan of action to build a more inclusive police service and address negative race disparities \u2026 Hearing from those with lived experience has driven our progress. Independent scrutiny and oversight will provide vital check and challenge.\u201d</p> \n<p>Malcolm Baker, a spokesperson from Black Lives Matter UK, said: \u201cWhile the verdict may feel like justice, there is no evidence it will quell the racist violence of the police and prison system. The Black Lives Matter movements across the globe are demanding systemic change, which no longer relies on an ever expanding police, prison and border regime to solve the problems we face.</p> \n<p>\u201cHere in Britain, on average one person a week has died in police custody, prisons or borders since 1990, and convicting the individuals responsible will not end this violence.\u201d</p> \n<p>Osaro Otobo, deputy chair of the British Youth Council, said: \u201cIt\u2019s imperative we do not lose sight of the need to continue to address deep-rooted racism in the US and here in the UK. If we are to end anti-black police brutality in the UK, we must take steps dismantle and overhaul a system which enables racism and injustice.\u201d</p>"

She sees clear comparisons to Floyd\u2019s case, saying: \u201cThe official police account of the event emphasises the drug use of a man who later died.

The video was titled \u201cNo \u2018Czech Floyd\u2019\u201d and received mixed responses on Twitter. Some defended the police, saying \u201cI agree with the police, walking around this neighbourhood is terrifying.\u201d But others criticised the intervention. \u201cSounds like Czech police are trying to justify the use of force and techniques, which have sadly resulted in needless death. It is obvious from both videos that what this person needed is help,\u201d said one.</p> <p>Miker, disagrees with the police statement, saying: \u201cWhile the police are saying that he was ill and on drugs, the locals I spoke to told me he was clean, only taking medication for his back pain.

The decision came after Lewis Hamilton wore a top at the Tuscan Grand Prix on 13 September that said \u201cArrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor\u201d. </p> <p>Since March, celebrities have not shied away from wearing clothing in support of Black Lives Matter (BLM) at high-profile events \u2013 but not without a backlash. The Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka was told to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/naomiosaka/status/1305959039902257152\">\u201ckeep politics out of sport\u201d</a> when she brought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/01/naomi-osaka-us-open-misaki-doi\">seven face masks with the names of different victims of police brutality</a> to the US Open. Almost 2,000 people complained to Ofcom \u2013 which has yet to decide whether to investigate \u2013 about the BLM necklace worn by Alesha Dixon on Britain\u2019s Got Talent (only a few weeks after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/17/ofcom-dismisses-complaints-over-blm-dance-on-britains-got-talent\">the programme received 24,500 complaints \u2013 later dismissed by the regulator \u2013 about a performance by the dance group Diversity</a> that was inspired by the police killing of George Floyd).</p> <p>The framing of these moments as radical and political rather than sincere and teachable has raised other questions, such as: are black lives allowed to matter in public spaces \u2013 public spaces that are normally the home of white privilege?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0a6c71b8ae10e16c5815980160db62802371c6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0a6c71b8ae10e16c5815980160db62802371c6a/0_0_1080_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yvonne Orji had the black power fist shaved into her hair for the Emmys\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Nuff said\u2019 ...

The fashion historian Darnell-Jamal Lisby says BLM clothes are perceived as threatening because they \u201cshake the belief that conditioned the world to believe that white people are superior\u201d. He says they \u201cdisrupt a system that privileges those who benefited from the oppression of black people\u201d. As such, the wearing of BLM clothing is suppressed (as in the case of Hamilton) or heavily criticised (as Dixon experienced).</p> <p>Last month\u2019s Emmys were especially powerful not only because of the number of celebrities wearing BLM clothes, but also because the intimate nature of the ceremony (with nominees filmed at home) made their clothes feel more personal than if they were on a red carpet.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/23/sterling-k-brown-black-panther-marvel-people-oj-simpson-this-is-us\">Sterling K Brown</a> of This Is Us wore a dinner jacket over a T-shirt emblazoned with a BLM logo and a black power fist. Yvonne Orji, best known for Insecure, had the fist shaved into her hair. Killing Eve\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/modooborahae/status/1307899586170753027\">Sandra Oh</a> wore a beautiful purple jacket with \u201cBlack lives are precious\u201d written on it in Korean.</p> <p>The T-shirt worn by the Watchmen writer Damon Lindelof was affecting, too. It bore the words \u201cRemember Tulsa \u201921\u201d, which referenced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/01/tulsa-massacre-1921-oklahoma-lawsuit\">the 1921 Tulsa massacre</a>, in which as many as 300 black residents of the city in Oklahoma were killed by white mobs.

     "body": "<p>Derek Chauvin declined to testify in his murder trial over the killing of George Floyd as the defence wrapped up its case after just two days of testimony.</p> <p>Chauvin invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination as he sacrificed the chance to explain to the jury why he kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes and for his lawyers to paint a more sympathetic picture of the police officer. But he also avoided a minute interrogation of his actions and thinking by the prosecution\u2019s cross-examination.</p> <p>Both sides will make closing arguments on Monday and the case will then go to the jury.</p> <p>Chauvin, 45, has denied charges of second- and third-degree murder, and manslaughter, over Floyd\u2019s death last May which prompted mass protests for racial justice across the US and other parts of the world.</p> <p>The defence rested its case after a series of witnesses challenged prosecution claims that Chauvin and two other police officers were responsible for Floyd\u2019s death by pinning him to the ground and instead blamed the 46-year-old Black man\u2019s heart conditions and drug use.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the defence\u2019s leading medical expert, Dr David Fowler, also introduced the idea that carbon monoxide from vehicle exhaust contributed to Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>And on Thursday, the judge allowed the prosecution to recall one of its key witnesses, Dr Martin Tobin, to rebut Fowler\u2019s testimony.</p> <p>Tobin challenged Fowler\u2019s assertion that the level of carboxyhemoglobin in Floyd\u2019s blood \u2013 carbon monoxide attached to protein which displaces oxygen \u2013 was between 10% and 18% which would have contributed to heart failure.</p> <p>\u201cI believe it is not reliable,\u201d said Tobin.</p> <p>Tobin said tests showed Floyd\u2019s blood oxygen saturation was 98%, leaving just 2% for \u201ceverything else\u201d.</p> <p>Last week, Tobin, a pulmonologist, told the trial that Chauvin and the other officers caused Floyd\u2019s death by cutting his oxygen supply which caused brain damage and his heart to stop. Tobin discounted defence attempts to shift the cause of death to Floyd\u2019s heart disease and drug use, saying that without the police officers on top of him he would not have died and that \u201ca healthy person subjected to what Mr Floyd was subjected to would have died\u201d.</p> <p>None of the charges require the prosecution to prove that Chauvin intentionally killed Floyd.</p> <p>To convict Chauvin of second degree murder, which carries a sentence of up to 40 years in prison, the jury must find that the accused policeman caused Floyd\u2019s death \u201cwhile committing or attempting to commit a felony offence\u201d, meaning assault in this case.</p> <p>Conviction on the lesser charge of third-degree murder, which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years, requires the jury to find Chauvin committed an \u201cact eminently dangerous to others \u2026 without regard for human life\u201d.</p> <p>The judge originally blocked the third-degree murder charge but the prosecution appealed and won its reinstatement because it increases the likelihood of a conviction if the jury is unable to agree that Chauvin was committing a crime by kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck instead of only showing disregard for his safety.</p> <p>Chauvin also faces a charge of second-degree manslaughter which requires prosecutors only to prove he took \u201can unreasonable risk\u201d that endangered Floyd\u2019s life. It carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.</p> <p>The judge told the jury that it would be sequestered once it begins its deliberations. Advising them on how much to pack, he said \u201cplan for long and hope for short\u201d.</p> <p>Three other police officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death are scheduled to be tried together later this year on charges of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.</p>"

Shifting our giving to prioritise leaders who are African is not only more just \u2013 it is more effective. When the global pandemic hit, guess which NGOs pulled staff and fled the continent? Here\u2019s a hint: it wasn\u2019t the locally led organisations. Just as with endless previous crises, African-led organisations have risen to the occasion and delivered to communities when others cannot. This isn\u2019t new. Grassroots organisations are consistently delivering impact at the frontlines \u2013 without the benefit of frontline funding.</p> <p>Across a portfolio of 200 African partners at <a href=\"https://www.segalfamilyfoundation.org/\">Segal Family Foundation</a>, we have repeatedly seen local leaders innovate and iterate, combine resources, and network to respond and rebuild.</p> <p>There are myriad reasons African-led organisations in Africa do not get the attention or funding they deserve. There are multiple, overlapping barriers that allow this inequity to persist: lack of proximity to funder networks, philanthropy\u2019s definitions of risk that do not value lived experience, lack of formally recognised status and well-documented implicit bias.</p> <p>But we can overcome that. We can fund groups that live, breathe, work and speak even the most nuanced language of their communities. At this moment, when we see funders starting to apply new, equity-based approaches to funding black-led organisations and movements in the US, we must also apply those approaches to funding across Africa.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://africanvisionary.org/\">African Visionary Fund</a> is a new pooled fund, seeded by a group of US foundations, designed to drive millions of dollars in unrestricted funding to African-led organisations. We do the due diligence, advocate for our partners and make grants directly to African leaders to accelerate their impact.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/sep/07/closing-the-race-gap-in-philanthropy-demands-radical-candour\">Closing the race gap in philanthropy demands radical candour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unlike many other philanthropic collaborations, the foundations also ceded power about how the fund will work and where the grants will go. The African Visionary Fund\u2019s founding work group is both majority-African and majority-doer, not donor. This means the way the fund does grant-making and supports grantees is grounded in the experiences of those it seeks to support. The fund will commit more than $1m (\u00a3740,000) in grants this month and is on its way to raising $10m by 2023 to support African visionaries to accelerate their impact. While philanthropy often moves slowly, the African Visionary Fund hopes to be a bridge to get resources into the hands of people who can deliver impact now.</p> <p>We have a unique opportunity, in this moment, to chart a more equitable future globally.

     "body": "<p>George Floyd\u2019s younger brother, Philonise Floyd, took the stand on Monday in the trial of the former police officer accused of murdering him and told the jury how George Floyd was \u201ca person that everybody loved around the community\u201d.</p> \n<p>Philonise Floyd broke down in tears when shown a picture of his late mother and a young George Floyd, saying: \u201cI miss both of them.\u201d</p> \n<p>He testified as part of an effort by prosecutors to humanize his brother in front of the jury and make him more than a crime statistic. Minnesota is a rarity as a state in allowing what is known as \u201cspark of life\u201d testimony during the trial stage.</p> \n<p>Earlier, a heart specialist said that<strong> </strong>George Floyd\u2019s death was \u201cabsolutely preventable\u201d and he would have lived if now-ex police officer Derek Chauvin had not pinned him to the street.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"57eaf280-7e7d-4f07-b989-ec194be0d37c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fXMtkBwngns?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Chauvin, who is white,<strong> </strong>denies murdering George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, last May, when he knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes during an arrest.</p> \n<p>Jonathan Rich, a cardiologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, took the stand as the last medical expert called by the prosecution. He told the jury he was certain Floyd did not die of a heart attack, heart disease or a drug overdose.</p> \n<p>The heart specialist said Floyd died of cardiopulmonary arrest \u2013 when adequate heart function and breathing stop \u2013 caused by low oxygen levels.</p> \n<p>When prosecutor Jerry Blackwell asked what caused the oxygen deficiency, Rich said it was \u201cinduced by the prone restraint and positional asphyxiation that he was subjected to\u201d.</p> \n<p>It was the 11th day of testimony in the historic trial. The prosecution is close to resting its case before the defense calls its witnesses. It is expected that relatives of Floyd will be allowed to address the court, to talk about his life and character.</p> \n<p>Floyd\u2019s death was caught on video and sparked the largest civil rights uprising in the US since the 1960s.</p> \n<p>Chauvin led three other officers last 25 May in forcing Floyd to the ground, face down and handcuffed behind his back, as they arrested him on suspicion of using a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes in a corner store.</p> \n<p>Chauvin kneeled on Floyd\u2019s neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds, the court has heard, as Floyd repeatedly said he couldn\u2019t breathe and cried for help before passing out.</p> \n<p>On Monday afternoon, Philonise Floyd was called to the stand.</p> \n<p>Philonise Floyd and other relatives of George Floyd have been a constant presence inside and outside court, turning up every day to support their family member\u2019s cause.</p> \n<p>He only spoke for a very short time and was not cross-examined by Chauvin\u2019s defense. But it was a powerful appearance that caught the attention of the jury, amid a lot of important but much drier expert testimony.</p> \n<p>Growing up, Philonise Floyd told the jury, George Floyd \u201cwas so much of a leader to us in the household\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe would always make sure that we had our clothes for school,\u201d Philonise Floyd recalled. \u201cHe made sure that we all were going to be to school on time. He just was like a person that everybody loved around the community. He just knew how to make people feel better.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cHe was a big momma\u2019s boy,\u201d he said of Floyd\u2019s relationship with their mother.</p> \n<p>When she died in May 2018, Philonise recalled, \u201cHe would just say \u2018Mama, Mama\u2019, over and over again.</p> \n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to tell him because I was in pain too,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was just holding her, just holding her. He didn\u2019t want to leave the casket.\u201d</p> \n<p>The aim of the prosecution and the family was to give a more rounded view of Floyd prior to the defense starting to call its witnesses, which is expected soon, and focusing on all the down sides of his life and health.</p> \n<p>Illicit drugs were found in Floyd\u2019s system and he had underlying health conditions which the defense intends to argue killed him, while Chauvin\u2019s actions were reasonable in dealing with a large, struggling suspect who was high on a mix of the opioid fentanyl and methamphetamine.</p> \n<p>But Rich, the cardiologist, said that in his opinion Floyd had been restrained by Chauvin \u201cin a life-threatening manner\u201d and was alert, awake, conversant and walking when the officers encountered him, the opposite signs and symptoms of someone who was overdosing.</p> \n<p>\u201cI believe that Mr George Floyd\u2019s death was absolutely preventable,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor asked if Floyd would have lived had it not been for Chauvin pressing down on his neck for more than nine minutes.</p> \n<p>\u201cYes I believe he would have lived,\u201d Rich said.</p> \n<p>Earlier, the judge, Peter Cahill, denied a request by the defense to sequester the jury owing to the potential influence of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/12/protests-minneapolis-fatal-police-shooting-traffic-stop\">fatal shooting of a 20-year-old Black man</a> by police in a suburb of Minneapolis on Sunday, which sparked protests.</p> \n<p>The last testimony on Monday afternoon involved a former police officer, law professor and expert on the use of force telling the trial that \u201cno reasonable officer\u201d would have used the level of force Chauvin applied on Floyd because Floyd was neither aggressive nor a threat. Seth Stoughton said that was particularly true during his last minutes under Chauvin\u2019s knee.</p> \n<p>\u201cSomebody who does not have a pulse does not present a threat in any way,\u201d Stoughton said. \u201cNo reasonable officer would have believed that was an acceptable, appropriate and reasonable use of force.\u201d</p> \n<p>The prosecution is close to resting its case and defense witness testimony is expected to begin on Tuesday. Cahill indicated that he expects closing arguments could take place next Monday, following which the jury will be sequestered for its deliberations prior to delivering its verdict.</p> \n<p>The trial continues.</p> \n<p><em>The Associated Press contributed reporting</em></p>"

He has been suspended from duty since June.</p> <p>The officer, from Torquay, made his first court appearance on Thursday via video link before the district judge Jo Matson, who was sitting in Plymouth. He was represented by Jamas Hodivala QC of Matrix Chambers. Matson said she would hear the trial herself at Plymouth magistrates court on 19 March.</p> <p>Jones is charged with sending the image by means of a public electronic communications network, an offence contrary to section 127 of the Communications Act 2003. Section 127 makes it an offence to send a message that \u201cis grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character\u201d.</p> <p>The case was investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which said before the hearing: \u201cAn altered image of George Floyd\u2019s arrest in Minneapolis was shared within a WhatsApp group that included a number of other police officers and staff.</p> <p>\u201cOur investigation began in June 2020 following a referral from the force. At its conclusion in October we sent our investigation report to the Crown Prosecution Service, which has authorised the charge.\u201d</p> <p>The IOPC has also investigated other officers who received the allegedly offensive meme for potential disciplinary offences. It will make those findings public after the conclusion of criminal proceedings, which take precedent.</p> <p>The Guardian revealed in June that an investigation had been launched into the sending of the image.</p> <p>Jim Nye, a Devon and Cornwall assistant chief constable, said in June: \u201cDevon and Cornwall police wholly appreciate the concern our communities will have regarding an investigation of this kind. I would reassure them that I, and the chief constable, will do everything possible to ensure the matter is dealt with effectively and in a timely manner.\u201d</p> <p>Floyd died after a US officer knelt on his neck in an incident that was caught on video, and which convulsed the US and led to more than 250,000 protesting in the UK against racial injustice.</p>"

He\u2019s tall, Black and a little buff, and I think: it could be him any day,\u201d she added.</p> <p>The core group of seven hasn\u2019t had the easiest time while peacefully protesting, despite the city saying before the trial began that such rights would be protected.</p> <p>They claim that the city has removed locks with the names of those killed by police officers from the gates, and turned off the power to nearby public electricity outlets.</p> <p>\u201cAnywhere there\u2019s any plugins, the city and the courts disconnected it all until after the trial,\u201d said Stewart, who uses a powered wheelchair, to the back of which is affixed a prominent Black Lives Matter sign.</p> <p>He\u2019s been left stranded a few times. \u201cI\u2019ve had to have people bring my charger downtown,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Neal said he was arrested last Thursday for trespassing.</p> <p>\u201cThey said I was sleeping, defiant, not listening to directives and threatening staff,\u201d Neal said.</p> <p>That has not stopped the 43-year-old from traveling over an hour every morning from his home to join the group behind the building, or protesting across the street.</p> <p>The core has held die-ins, sign-making events, and have future plans for a talent show to build community and activist participation.</p> <p>Floyd was pinned by the neck to the ground for more than nine minutes, at first pleading for his life and then slipping into unconsciousness after being handcuffed by the police and held down by Chauvin and two other former officers, while a fourth held bystanders at bay.</p> <p>All four officers were fired the next day by the Minneapolis police chief, Medaria Arradondo, who testified against Chauvin on Monday. The other three will stand trial in August. They deny aiding and abetting murder.</p> <p>Adoga said of the protest group: \u201cWe lay on the ground for nine minutes and 29 seconds, like George did, so people can see what it\u2019s like.\u201d</p> <p>Floyd has unwittingly become the face of the movement against police killings in America.</p> <p>But more than 200 people have suffered police-involved deaths in Minnesota alone in the last 20 years, <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/every-police-involved-death-in-minnesota-since-2000/502088871/\">a database</a> compiled by the Minneapolis Star Tribune calculated.

That haven\u2019t even got any kind of publicity.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The Greek government, put on the defensive by mounting allegations of police brutality, has appealed for calm following clashes on the streets of Athens, mass protests and growing anger over the country\u2019s prolonged lockdown.</p> <p>The prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, called for restraint after an initially peaceful demonstration against police aggression turned violent late on Tuesday. Three policemen were injured in the street battles that ensued as law enforcers attempted to repel youths lobbing rocks and firebombs with teargas, water cannons and stun grenades.</p> <p>The protest had been prompted by outrage over video clips depicting a police officer brutally beating a man with an iron baton for reportedly breaking lockdown measures.</p> <p>\u201cI am addressing young people, who are destined to create and not to destroy,\u201d said Mitsotakis in an impromptu televised address after it emerged that one of the policemen had been seriously injured when he was dragged off a motorcycle and repeatedly kicked.</p> <p>\u201cBlind rage does not lead anywhere. It should serve as a wake-up call that the life of a young policeman was endangered. At this point everyone must display restraint and calm.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday, as tensions intensified, thousands of students took to the streets denouncing the centre-right government\u2019s plans to install unarmed police units on university campuses.</p> <p>\u201cRage is building up,\u201d said Panagotis Katis, 20, a political science undergraduate at the University of the Peloponnese as he marched on the Athens parliament. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the campus police which goes against every notion of universities being places that ensure freedom of expression. People are incensed that their basic rights are being attacked by police who should be protecting us, not abusing the law, and that\u2019s why so many are out here today.\u201d</p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s clashes erupted after more than 5,000 people gathered in the southern suburb of Nea Smyrni, an area better known for its aura of law-abiding respectability, to protest against increasingly heavy-handed police tactics. Some held banners emblazoned with the words \u201cCops out of our neighbourhoods\u201d.</p> <p>The march was organised after anger built over video clips showing a police officer beating a 29-year-old student in Nea Smyrni\u2019s central square on Sunday.</p> <p>The man had been sitting on a bench enjoying the fresh air, when a police officer rounded on him, apparently in the belief that he had breached stringent curbs restricting freedom of movement. \u201cHe pushed me and then the other officers kicked me all over my body,\u201d the student subsequently told the leftwing newspaper Efsyn, explaining he had been trying to reason with the squad who had been levelling \u20ac300 fines on people deemed to be breaking the law.</p> <p>In a rare step, the officer was relieved of his duties on Wednesday following an internal investigation. Aristotelia Peloni, a government spokesperson, conceded that the video footage shared on social media was \u201cdisturbing to everyone\u201d.</p> <p>The incident has highlighted the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/31/greek-activists-warn-of-surge-in-police-brutality-and-rights-violations\">often violent tactics</a> of a police force that in both manpower and material reinforcements has been greatly reinvigorated by the Mitsotakis administration. The ruling New Democracy party assumed office in July 2019 promising to be tough on law and order after blaming its leftist predecessor, Syriza, for allowing lawlessness to flourish.</p> <p>But complaints of police brutality have soared particularly since the start of the pandemic, according to the ombudsman tasked with looking into the latest incident.</p> <p>Human rights groups and the Athens bar association have also criticised the excessive use of force, both attributing police actions to a culture of endemic impunity that has allowed the infractions to continue. Among the alleged abuses are reports of people being strip-searched in broad daylight.</p> <p>Last year the government was criticised for legislation banning protests that it argued were dangerous to public safety. Amnesty International\u2019s Greek branch held it accountable for the rise in violent incidents.</p> <p>Much of Greece has been in lockdown since November, fuelling frustration and deepening fatigue in a nation that on Tuesday saw its worst ever surge in infection rates. \u201cThe country has a government that has totally lost control of the pandemic, and the only thing it knows how to do \u2026 is use a heavy hand,\u201d said Syriza\u2019s leader and former prime minister, Alexis Tsipras.</p> <p>Pressure has grown in recent weeks as demonstrators have openly defied the ban on protests to hold marches in solidarity with Dimitris Koufondinas, the chief hitman of the now defunct 17 November, who has been on hunger strike for the past two months. Leftwing supporters of the terrorist, convicted of the murders of 11 people, including a former British embassy military attache, were among those who took to the streets of Athens on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re all here, including his son over there,\u201d said one protester, pointing to a young man wearing a red bandanna mask. \u201cKoufondinas wanted us on the streets. It\u2019s getting explosive. There\u2019s a lot of anger in the air.\u201d</p>"

Cameron would also present the result of his office\u2019s investigation into the case.</p> <p>It is unclear exactly when he will make an announcement or if the grand jury has begun deliberations.</p> <p>The Louisville police department announced early on Tuesday morning that it will restrict vehicle traffic downtown \u201cdue to increased attention and activity in anticipation of an announcement\u201d and to \u201censure the area is as safe as possible for those coming downtown to express their first amendment rights\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LMPD/status/1308307564933910530\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Attention: Anyone with upcoming business downtown <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LMPD?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LMPD</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FL37wjGpBj\">pic.twitter.com/FL37wjGpBj</a></p>&mdash; LMPD (@LMPD) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LMPD/status/1308307564933910530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 22, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The department also declared a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d, which means all off-days and vacation will be cancelled and officers will be expected to work 12-hour shifts.

Our goal with these steps is ensuring space and opportunity for potential protesters to gather and express their first amendment rights, and to prepare for any eventuality to keep everyone safe.\u201d</p> <p>As the investigation by the attorney general has progressed, protests have spread in Louisville and across the US. Calls to arrest the officers involved in the Taylor killing have been widespread, with pressure from high-profile figures including the singer Beyonc\u00e9, who wrote an <a href=\"https://www.beyonce.com/letter-to-attorney-general-daniel-cameron/\">open letter</a> to Cameron, urging arrest.</p> <p>Legal experts have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/10/breonna-taylor-killing-officers-may-never-be-arrested\">said</a> that whether the officers will be charged is unclear but may be unlikely given the protection that is offered to police.</p> <p>Self-defense laws in most states, including Kentucky, allow a person to use deadly force against an intruder in their home. But in Kentucky that protection does not allow a person to harm police officers if the person knows or can reasonably assume police have entered their home.</p>"

The watchdog said: \u201cSergeant Geraint Jones, aged 47, is charged with sending the image on 30 May last year by means of a public electronic communications network, an offence contrary to section 127 of the Communications Act 2003.</p> <p>\u201cAn altered image of George Floyd\u2019s arrest in Minneapolis was shared within a WhatsApp group that included a number of other police officers and staff.</p> <p>\u201cOur investigation began in June 2020 following a referral from the force. At its conclusion in October we sent our investigation report to the Crown Prosecution Service, which has authorised the charge.\u201d</p> <p>The officer is scheduled to appear at Newton Abbot magistratescourt on 28 January.</p> <p>The IOPC has also investigated other officers who received the allegedly offensive meme for potential disciplinary offences.

Initially, the (Los Angeles police) department treated these as isolated incidents, rather than as a manifestation of a larger expression of outrage that was spreading across the United States,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>The LAPD did not immediately respond to the report.</p> <p>The review, headed by the criminal defense attorney Gerald Chaleff, found that LAPD commanders failed to establish a clear command structure for directing its response to the outbreak of violence, leading to a \u201cchaos of command\u201d that left officers unsure of who was in charge as events unfolded.</p> <p>\u201cIt appears the department believed that if protests arising out of George Floyd\u2019s death occurred in Los Angeles that they all would be peaceful,\u201d the report\u2019s authors said. \u201cIn interviews with the review team, interviewees said they were surprised at the violence that occurred in the afternoon and evening hours at some protests.\u201d</p> <p>Other mistakes cited in the analysis included poor training of officers in use of non-lethal weapons, and failing to anticipate that the protests could spread beyond the city\u2019s downtown and lack of field jails.</p> <p>\u201cThousands of people were arrested throughout the protests without a clearly articulated plan for detentions, transportation and processing,\u201d the report said. \u201cThose arrested were detained at the scene of the arrests for hours, handcuffed on the pavement, detained in buses, and taken to remote locations, without water or the use of bathroom facilities.\u201d</p> <p>The report also noted that the protests occurred during the pandemic, meaning that \u201cofficers and those arrested were in close proximity, not socially distancing, many without masks and thus at risk of being exposed to the Covid-19 virus.\u201d</p> <p>Between 29 May and 2 June, the LAPD arrested more than 4,000 people, the report stated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/10/george-gascon-los-angeles-district-attorney-prison-reform\"> LA's top prosecutor adopted major reforms. Law enforcement is fighting to block every policy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A number of lawsuits have been filed against the city of Los Angeles and the LAPD in connection with these arrests and injuries incurred during these protests. \u201cThere are reports that people were struck in the face and head, causing significant injuries, some of which required surgery,\u201d the report stated. \u201cNot all people struck with less lethal munitions during the protests were engaging in criminal behavior. This appears to be in part due to the complex and rapid movement of the crowds and at times a lack of adequate training.\u201d</p> <p>In all, the 101-page report had 67 findings and listed 10 recommendations that included a periodic audit that the LAPD is in compliance with all lawsuit settlements, an extensive study of less-lethal munitions, an update on use-of-force directives in large crowds and more instruction regarding the use of less-lethal munitions on crowds.</p> <p>The report noted that during the protests, 106 officers suffered injuries from \u201cdangerous objects being thrown at them, lasers used to injure their eyes, and other methods used to injure the officers and incite the crowd of protesters\u201d. In addition, 141 LAPD patrol cars were severely damaged and six were destroyed by fire and other forms of vandalism. Yet \u201cdespite the provocations, the police must be able to effectively address those who are committing criminal acts and causing disruption,\u201d the report states.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the fundamental duties of policing is to protect the first amendment right to free speech, assembly and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances,\u201d the report reads.<strong> </strong>\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The relief that swept through the crowd outside the Minneapolis court, and rippled around the world, was in its own way shocking. The conviction of Derek Chauvin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\" title=\"\">for George Floyd\u2019s murder</a> should have been inevitable. The sight of the policeman kneeling upon the 46-year-old\u2019s neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds, as the dying man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/08/george-floyd-police-killing-transcript-i-cant-breathe\" title=\"\">pleaded repeatedly that he couldn\u2019t breathe</a> and called out to his late mother, was caught on camera, described by traumatised witnesses, and condemned by fellow officers during the trial.</p> <p>Yet until the jury\u2019s verdict arrived \u2013 guilty on all counts \u2013 no one could be certain of it. So many black men, women and children have died at the hands of police without those officers facing trial, let alone conviction, even on lesser charges. If anyone wonders what might have happened without the footage shot by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/darnella-frazier-george-floyd-derek-chauvin-trial-guilty-verdict\" title=\"\">17-year-old bystander</a>, they might refer to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/04/20/how-first-statement-minneapolis-police-made-george-floyds-murder-seem-like-george-floyds-fault/\" title=\"\">initial police account</a>, titled only \u201cMan dies after medical incident during police interaction\u201d.</p> <p>Eighteen previous complaints <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/28/us/minneapolis-officer-complaints-george-floyd/index.html\" title=\"\">had been filed</a> against Chauvin. Three of his colleagues \u2013 due to stand trial in August \u2013 were involved when Mr Floyd died, and did not stop the officer. US police killed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/17/us/police-shootings-killings.html\" title=\"\">more than three people a day</a> during his trial. They included a 20-year-old black man, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/15/a-lovable-young-man-daunte-wright-was-a-doting-father-with-big-life-dreams\" title=\"\">Daunte Wright</a>, shot dead less than 10 miles from the courtroom during a traffic stop. A black 16-year-old girl, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/04/20/989342784/16-year-old-black-girl-who-called-for-help-fatally-shot-by-police-ohio-family-sa\" title=\"\">Ma\u2019Khia Bryant</a>, was shot in Columbus, Ohio, shortly before the verdict. American policing was on trial in Minneapolis. But accountability was achieved for only one victim.</p> <p>Thankfully, the US president is no longer the man who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/29/nyregion/trump-police-too-nice.html\" title=\"\">told police</a> \u201cdon\u2019t be too nice\u201d. Instead, Joe Biden urged his country: \u201cThis could be a moment of significant change \u2026 We can\u2019t leave this moment or look away thinking our work is done.\u201d The justice department\u2019s investigation into the police department is a statement of the administration\u2019s intent, but this goes far beyond Minneapolis. Passing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, if it can be done, would be a very small step forward; some states and cities have already passed reforms. Shifting the conduct and ethos of the US\u2019s 18,000 separate police departments is an extraordinarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-guilty-verdict-george-floyd-analysis\" title=\"\">complex and daunting challenge</a>. Ultimately, a reckoning of the broader issues must include asking whether it makes any sense to fund police so lavishly while other essential services struggle and \u2013 hardest of all \u2013 redrawing <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/04/20/verdict-isnt-end-this-story/\" title=\"\">white America\u2019s imagination</a>, though Mr Floyd\u2019s murder has perhaps<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/04/17/being-black-america-is-exhausting/\" title=\"\"> begun that task</a>.</p> <p>His death was shaped by specifically American issues around race and policing. Yet the millions who mourned his loss and invoked his name as protests swept the globe, from Brazil to Nigeria to the UK, recognised as well as lamented what had been done to him. The words \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d have been used too many times, in too many places. There have been 1,782 deaths in police custody or otherwise following contact with the police in England and Wales since 1990. But no officer has been convicted of manslaughter, murder or assault in relation to such a death <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/crime/prosecutions-deaths-police-custody/\" title=\"\">since 1971</a>. As the US president acknowledged America\u2019s long history of systemic racism and called for change, the UK government <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2021-04-20/debates/1502466F-D06B-402A-B7C0-03452FFB1DA9/CommissionOnRaceAndEthnicDisparities\" title=\"\">was defending</a> its swiftly discredited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/12/bodies-credited-in-uk-race-review-distance-themselves-from-findings\" title=\"\">race report</a>, which played down evidence of institutional racism.</p> <p>Around the world, the unequal toll of the pandemic has brought fresh recognition that structural racism kills, beyond the realm of policing, and given fresh force to the cry that black lives matter. Change will be resisted. Yet without the involvement and engagement of protesters, we might not be here today. Progress is no more inevitable than Chauvin\u2019s conviction was. But the guilty verdict reminds us what is possible, and what must be done.</p>"
