     "body": "<p>The Black Lives Matter movement has been nominated for the 2021 Nobel peace prize for the way its call for systemic change has spread around the world.</p> <p>In his nomination papers, the Norwegian MP Petter Eide said the movement had forced countries outside the US to grapple with racism within their own societies.</p> <p>\u201cI find that one of the key challenges we have seen in America, but also in Europe and Asia, is the kind of increasing conflict based on inequality,\u201d Eide said. \u201cBlack Lives Matter has become a very important worldwide movement to fight racial injustice.</p> <p>\u201cThey have had a tremendous achievement in raising global awareness and consciousness about racial injustice.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/29/tributes-to-slave-traders-and-colonialists-removed-across-uk\">Tributes to slave traders and colonialists removed across UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eide, who has previously nominated human rights activists from Russia and China for the prize, said one other thing that impressed him about the Black Lives Matter movement was the way \u201cthey have been able to mobilise people from all groups of society, not just African-Americans, not just oppressed people, it has been a broad movement, in a way which has been different from their predecessors.\u201d</p> <p>The Black Lives Matter movement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/19/blacklivesmatter-birth-civil-rights-movement\">was co-founded in 2013 </a>by Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi in response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/george-zimmerman-trial-trayvon-martin\">acquittal in the US of the man who shot Trayvon Martin</a>. It gained wider recognition in 2014 following protests over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ferguson\">deaths of Michael Brown</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/16/eric-garner-death-new-york-no-charges\">Eric Garner</a>, and was the wellspring of a series of global protests in 2020 following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">deaths of George Floyd</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/breonna-taylor\">Breonna Taylor</a>.</p> <p>Nominations for the Nobel peace prize are accepted from any politician serving at a national level, and they are allowed just 2,000 words to state their case. The deadline for this year\u2019s submission is 1 February, and by the end of March the committee prepares a shortlist. The winner is chosen in October and the award ceremony is scheduled for 10 December. There were more than 300 nominations for last year\u2019s award, which was ultimately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/09/uns-world-food-programme-wins-nobel-peace-prize\">won by the World Food Programme</a>.</p> <p>The committee awarded the WFP because it wanted to \u201cturn the eyes of the world to the millions of people who suffer from or face the threat of hunger\u201d, but perhaps the most high profile nomination last year<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/09/norwegian-far-right-mp-nominates-donald-trump-for-nobel-peace-prize\"> was for former US president Donald Trump</a>.</p> <p>Trump was nominated for a second time by another Norwegian MP, Christian Tybring-Gjedde. The far-right MP cited Trump\u2019s role in normalising relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates under the Abraham Accords, although Eide said Tybring-Gjedde had \u201ca little difficulty defending that nomination\u201d after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/09/us-capitol-insurrection-white-supremacist-terror\">the Capitol riot of 6 January</a> when a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Congress buildings and five people died.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb6d91d14e06fadbb0f58d75dae32255caae6e29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb6d91d14e06fadbb0f58d75dae32255caae6e29/0_511_2133_1280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Petter Eide\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Petter Eide, who has nominated the Black Lives Matter movement for the Nobel peace prize.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Mydske/Peter Mydske/Norwegian Parliament</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eide, however, said he didn\u2019t want his nomination for Black Lives Matter to be seen as a comment on domestic US politics. And he dismissed criticism from rightwing voices that the group had been behind violence in US cities. \u201cStudies have shown that most of the demonstrations organised by Black Lives Matter have been peaceful,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course there have been incidents, but most of them have been caused by the activities of either the police or counter-protestors.\u201d</p> <p>Data assembled by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project in September 2020 showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/05/nearly-all-black-lives-matter-protests-are-peaceful-despite-trump-narrative-report-finds\">93% of Black Lives Matter demonstrations involved no serious harm</a> to people or property.</p> <p>The 61-year-old politician, who has represented the Socialist Left party in parliament since 2017, cited precedents of the Oslo-based Nobel prize committee recognising the battle against racism. Albert Luthuli and Nelson Mandela received the prize in 1960 and 1993 respectively for advocating against racial discrimination in South Africa, and Martin Luther King was awarded the prize for non-violent resistance against racism in the US in 1964. Mandela shared his award with FW de Klerk, the man who ordered the ANC leader\u2019s release from prison.</p> <p>\u201cThere is actually a tradition for doing this,\u201d Eide said. \u201cIt\u2019s a strong linkage between antiracism movements and peace, and a recognition that without this kind of justice, there will be no peace and stability in the society.\u201d</p> <p>His written nomination concludes: \u201cAwarding the peace prize to Black Lives Matter, as the strongest global force against racial injustice, will send a powerful message that peace is founded on equality, solidarity and human rights, and that all countries must respect those basic principles.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Black artists in the UK are producing the most \u201cexciting\u201d and \u201csocially engaged\u201d work at the moment, a leading British playwright and curator said.</p> <p>Michael McMillan, a London-based artist and academic who was behind the successful The West Indian Front Room, also believes the Black Lives Matter movement has inspired a new generation of black artists to work in innovative ways and produce cutting-edge work.</p> <p>McMillan did, however, warn that the current time of crisis was a double-edged sword for black creators, with the pandemic forcing many into poverty that could exclude them from creating art. But he said he remained optimistic.</p> <p>\u201cI have a lot of hope. There will be exciting work. I think that black literature is the most exciting literature at the moment,\u201d he said, before quickly correcting himself: \u201cIs the most exciting literature, period.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cI think black artists are producing some of the most exciting, relevant and socially engaged work at the moment. And there will be new, exciting work that will come.\u201d </p> <p>He points to the playwright and director debbie tucker green, who brings<strong> </strong>\u201cpoetry to her work through the economy of language\u201d, Sir Steve McQueen, described as the \u201cgreatest film-maker in Britain at the moment\u201d, and Michaela Coel, who brings \u201cempathy, power and laughter\u201d to her work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e36f07242b7b1e0007427a4005454684eac9a13f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e36f07242b7b1e0007427a4005454684eac9a13f/0_0_2961_1664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michaela Coel accepts an Emmy Award for outstanding writing for a limited or anthology series or movie for I May Destroy You.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michaela Coel accepts an Emmy Award for outstanding writing for a limited or anthology series or movie for I May Destroy You.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking before the launch of an anthology, Sonic vibrations: Sound system culture, lovers rock, and dub, at the Museum of the Home, McMillan added that the Black Lives Matter movement had pushed a lot of black activists and artists to take up space in historically white institutions.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not no longer asking any more. We\u2019re demanding it and that\u2019s important because you have corporations, institutions, who do symbolic things \u2013 they\u2019re going to employ more people of colour, they\u2019re going to be more diverse, they\u2019re going to try to be more inclusive \u2013 some of that\u2019s genuine, some of that merely symbolic. A difference that makes no differences, as Stuart Hall always says, and that\u2019s why we have to push,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The anthology, which was <a href=\"https://writersmosaic.org.uk/content/sonic-vibrations-part-1/\">published by Writers Mosaic</a>, an initiative that is part of the Royal Literary Fund, features work from sound system practitioners, writers, poets, performers, and visual artists.</p> <p>He said he believed it was vital to retrace the roots of past cultural moments, such as sound system culture, and celebrate the role it has played in laying the foundation for a rich black British culture. \u201cAcross the UK, there were apparently 500 sound systems at one point and they provide a multiracial, alternative space where white and black [people] could just rave and dance. On the street, it was quite a brutally racist time. But in the dance space, there was a lot more equity, and that\u2019s quite significant.\u201d</p> <p>Sound System is the basis of reggae music, it is the basis of dub, garage, drum\u2019n\u2019bass, grime, and drill.\u201d</p> <p>The anthology comes 16 years after McMillan first exhibited The West Indian Front Room To Life. More than 35,000 people visited the exhibition in east London between 2005 and 2006. The exhibition, now simply known as The Front Room, was widely praised for showcasing the multicultural reality of British society. Last year, the Museum of the Home decided to make it a permanent exhibition.</p> <p>But multiculturalism has been under sustained attack in the UK, McMillan said. \u201cWe have the government and institutions who are pushing back. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/01/race-in-britain-how-did-the-sewell-report-get-it-so-wrong\">Tony Sewell report</a> symbolises the pushback against that reality.\u201d This attack is not new, McMillan added. \u201cIt was under attack by David Cameron because he said it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/feb/05/david-cameron-speech-criticised-edl\">an experiment that went wrong</a>. It was never an experiment. It\u2019s just a reality. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re part of the English language landscape, whether we like it or not. Our labour built those country estates.\u201d</p> <p>He criticised the tendency to look to the US for a narrative about black struggle and history. \u201cThere\u2019s been a black presence in the UK since the Romans. There were 20,000 black people in London during the 18th century. There are millions of white people in this country who have black ancestors. So to talk about Windrush as that moment when we all arrive, no, it\u2019s just the next stage. I\u2019m very adamant about that.</p> <p>\u201cBlack history is not something separate to history, we are all connected to history in British history. You cannot talk about British history, unless you talk about colonialism and imperialism. And in that you cannot talk about that unless you talk about Africa, the Caribbean, and Asia.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Kevin Gough, a defense attorney in the trial over the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, has sparked outrage after asking the court to limit the number of Black pastors who can sit with the Arbery family, claiming their presence could influence the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/03/ahmaud-arbery-judge-seats-nearly-all-white-jury-in-georgia-trial\">almost entirely white jury.</a></p> \n<p>On Thursday, while addressing Judge Timothy Walmsley, who is presiding over the trial, Gough claimed that high-profile Black pastors such as the Rev Al Sharpton and the Rev Jesse Jackson could be \u201cintimidating\u201d for jury members.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s only so many pastors they [Arbery\u2019s family] can have.

This is pouring salt into their wounds.\u201d</p> \n<p>Gough previously said in an interview <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/not-enough-joe-six-packs-among-potential-jurors-trial-ahmaud-n1283122\">with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a> that the jury selection pool in the case did not have enough \u201cbubbas or Joe six-packs\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/jury-finally-qualified-for-trial-involving-arberys-killing/5C5XLUIGEVBI5DLDAT6O6LAR3E/\">meaning white men over 40 without a college degree</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe want a diverse jury,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cBut we\u2019re missing a segment of what would normally be here.\u201d</p> \n<p>Defense attorneys representing the three white men accused of murdering Arbery eventually struck all but one potential Black juror, meaning the jury for the case consists of 11 white members and one Black member, vastly out of proportion with the county demographics.</p> \n<p>The jury was shown video on Thursday of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery</a> walking around a vacant property on an earlier visit to the mostly white southern Georgia neighborhood where the 25-year-old Black man was later fatally shot after being chased by the three white men.</p> \n<p>Defendants Gregory McMichael, 65, his son Travis McMichael, 35, and their neighbor William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan, 52, have pleaded not guilty to murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment. They face life in prison if convicted of murder.</p> \n<p>The trial is in its second week of hearing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/05/ahmaud-arbery-murder-trial-assumptions-prosecution\">arguments</a> and evidence in a case closely watched and widely regarded as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/03/ahmaud-arbery-trial-accused-killers-test-us-racial-justice\">litmus test</a> for the state of racial justice in the US.</p> \n<p>Speaking outside the Glynn county courthouse as the trial opened, Arbery\u2019s mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/04/ahmaud-arbery-family-white-jury-murder-trial\">said she found</a> the final jury\u2019s racial makeup \u201cdevastating\u201d but was confident the jury would \u201cmake the right decision\u201d.</p> \n<p>The defendants have argued they thought Arbery <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/10/ahmaud-arbery-killing-trial\">might have been</a> fleeing a crime, rather than going on one of his regular jogs in the area, and they pursued in an attempt to make a citizen\u2019s arrest when he ran through Satilla Shores, a suburb of the small coastal city of Brunswick, south-eastern Georgia, in February 2020.</p> \n<p>They chased him in two pickup trucks for several minutes, closing in on him and attempting to block his path, before the younger McMichael pointed a shotgun and fired as Arbery ran toward him and appeared to reach toward the weapon.</p> \n<p>Their lawyers are arguing this was justified self-defense.</p> \n<p>During the fifth day of witness testimony on Thursday the jury was played a video deposition recorded in September.</p> \n<p>In it, Larry English said he had been slowly building a house in Satilla Shores, which would end up setting in motion the events that led to Arbery\u2019s killing.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy dream was to have a place on the water,\u201d he said. He knew local kids sometimes roamed about the property, which was unfenced, and worried about people having an accident around the boat dock out back, so he installed surveillance cameras that sent videos to his phone.</p> \n<p>A clip of Arbery walking around the dock at night in October 2019 was played, along with a recording of the 911 call English made.</p> \n<p>\u201cI got a trespasser,\u201d English told the operator, saying he could see on camera a \u201ccolored guy\u201d with tattoos on his arms and curly hair and who may have been drunk or on drugs as he was \u201cplundering around\u201d the property.</p> \n<p>In the deposition, English said he decided soon after that it was more likely the man was not intoxicated but moving cautiously in the dark in a way that looked odd on the night-vision video.</p> \n<p>Nothing was taken that night, English said. A clip from November showing a man and woman, both white, wandering through the property at night was also played, along with the 911 call English made to report them.</p> \n<p>However, English shared the clips of Arbery with some of his neighbors, and the McMichaels have said they knew about the reports of a Black stranger roaming around English\u2019s property when Arbery ran by their driveway on 23 February 2020, during the daytime.</p> \n<p>English has also said, via a lawyer, that he later concluded that Arbery had been stopping by a faucet on his property for a drink of water.</p> \n<p>The trial continues.</p>"

When you are of south Asian descent, it\u2019s ingrained in you to address older south Asian men, regardless of relation, as Uncle. I call Mark Uncle, and I think he finds that quite strange. I\u2019ve always wanted my parents\u2019 approval, but because Mark is one of the funniest people I know AND an Uncle, I kinda want his approval more.</p> <h2>5.

Nobody is willing to take risks or back new ideas \u2013 but surely if you\u2019re going to just keep rehashing old ideas, you\u2019d start with some of the greatest television of all time? This Instagram account that mashes together The Sopranos and Seinfeld gets it.</p> <h2>6.

It was a messy trial and I won\u2019t go into details, but at one point we learned about how the accused (who is now in jail) sent way too many texts to the plaintiff. We then spent two days listening to those texts being read out, one by one. That experience obviously wasn\u2019t essential to finding this sketch hilarious, but it did make it extra special for me.</p> <h2>7. Katt Williams: Every Day I\u2019m Hustlin</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLDitGAUrno\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kLDitGAUrno?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I love Katt Williams. This song and this Williams bit are one and the same in my mind now. Thank god Coles Radio would never dare play Rick Ross, because I would be pushing my trolley down those aisles emptying all the shelves, doing this dance.</p> <h2>8. Reddit post: \u2018My girlfriend told me the music I play during sex is weird\u2019</h2> <p>I don\u2019t fully understand what Reddit is, but every now and then my friend and long-time collaborator Neilesh Verma will send me things from there and I know they\u2019ll bring plenty of joy. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/x35iu6/tifu_my_20f_girlfriend_of_two_years_told_me_the/\">This is no different.</a> It\u2019s wonderful storytelling, with jeopardy, stakes and it all builds to a highly satisfying climax.</p> <h2>9. Maria Bamford</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7hcHAXudlE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l7hcHAXudlE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>I loved the Melbourne comedy festival gala as a kid (and still do). It is probably one of the main reasons I started doing comedy. Maria Bamford was a regular and she was always so funny, in a way that was always her own. The commencement speech she gave at her alma mater (don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t know what a commencement speech, alma or mater are either) was in a way that was completely her own as well. It\u2019s brilliant.</p> <h2>10.

Racially motivated police brutality is obviously not funny, but somehow a naff Euro dance track inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement couldn\u2019t be funnier. Soaring synth, a sample of Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s I Have a Dream speech, and a beat drop followed by Guetta\u2019s fist pumping while people dance along at home \u2013 that\u2019s comedy.</p>"

The McMichaels said they believed Arbery was a burglar and that he was shot after attacking Travis McMichael with his fists.</p> <p>Police did not charge any of them immediately following the shooting, and the McMichaels and Bryan remained free for more than two months until the Georgia bureau of investigation took over the case. All three were charged with murder in May 2020 and face trial this fall. Prosecutors say Arbery was merely jogging in their neighborhood and was unarmed when Travis McMichael shot him. They say there is no evidence Arbery had committed a crime.</p> <p>Greg McMichael had worked as an investigator in Johnson\u2019s office, having retired in 2019. Evidence introduced in pre-trial hearings in the murder case shows he called Johnson\u2019s cellphone and left her a voice message soon after the shooting occurred.</p> <p>\u201cJackie, this is Greg,\u201d he said, according to a recording of the call included in the public case file. \u201cCould you call me as soon as you possibly can? My son and I have been involved in a shooting and I need some advice right away.\u201d</p> <p>A record of Greg McMichael\u2019s cellphone calls that day does not show that Johnson called him back.</p> <p>The indictment says Johnson showed \u201cfavor and affection\u201d toward Greg McMichael in the investigation and interfered with police officers at the scene by \u201cdirecting that Travis McMichael should not be placed under arrest\u201d.</p> <p>Lee Merritt, an attorney for Arbery\u2019s mother, said in a statement on Thursday that prosecutors \u201cmust be held accountable when they interfere with investigations in order to protect friends and law enforcement\u201d.</p> <p>Arbery\u2019s mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, posted her reaction on Facebook: \u201cFormer DA Jackie Johnson....Indicted!!! JusticeForMyBaby!!!!\u201d</p> <p>Johnson has insisted she did nothing wrong, saying she immediately recused herself from the case because Greg McMichael was a former employee. She recommended an outside prosecutor who was appointed to the case and concluded no charges were warranted. That prosecutor, George Barnhill, later stepped aside after Arbery\u2019s family noted he had a son working for Johnson as an assistant prosecutor.</p> <p>Johnson lost re-election last year, and blamed the controversy over Arbery\u2019s death for her defeat. She did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m confident that when the truth finally comes out on that, people will understand our office did what it had to under the circumstances,\u201d Johnson told the Associated Press in November after she lost re-election.</p>"

At the last Met Gala, in 2019, Lady Gaga <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/video/2019/may/07/lady-gagas-met-gala-transformation-in-one-minute-timelapse-video\">made four costume changes</a> on the red carpet.

Visitors will be greeted by a red, white and blue silk sash emblazoned with a question: \u201cWho Gets To Be American?\u201d from a 2019 catwalk show by the designer Prabal Gurung, who is of Nepalese heritage. More than 40% of the exhibits are by designers of colour, a higher proportion than in any previous Costume Institute ensemble show.</p> <p>\u201cThe approach of this exhibition very much came out of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement,\u201d said the curator Andrew Bolton. \u201cAmerican fashion is undergoing a renaissance that is being driven by engagement with political and social issues. Young fashion designers in America, as in Britain, are at the forefront of conversations about inclusivity around race and gender and the body. When you talk to them about their ambitions, it\u2019s not about jobs at the big European houses or being the next Ralph Lauren or Diane Von Furstenberg. They approach fashion in an ethical way which is rooted in values and community.\u201d</p> <p>The show is a risk-taking move by the Costume Institute. Visitors expecting a blockbuster showcase of American fashion\u2019s greatest hits will be disappointed. The patrician glamour of Ralph Lauren, the clean-lined vigour of Tommy Hilfiger and the bold sensuality of Roy Halston will be represented, but not privileged. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/feb/09/guardianobituaries4\">Bonnie Cashin</a>, an esteemed but overlooked mid-century designer who pioneered comfortable separates for postwar working women, is one of the few names to have two looks in the exhibition. Almost every other designer, from mogul to unknown, has just one piece.</p> <p>But Bolton, who launched the age of the must-see fashion exhibition with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2011/feb/23/alexander-mcqueen-savage-beauty-pictures\">Savage Beauty</a>, his 2011 show about Alexander McQueen, is backing the emotional punch of his fashion-forward take on American identity to win over audiences. \u201cWhen I walk through a museum, it\u2019s when an object moves me and affects me that I am pulled in,\u201d he notes.</p> <p>The show is arranged not by decade or by trend, but by emotion. \u201cExuberance\u201d is represented by a vast violet taffeta ballgown from 2020 by the emerging catwalk star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2020/feb/14/new-york-fashion-week-autumn-winter-2020-key-shows-in-pictures\">Christopher John Rogers</a>, who was named designer of the year at the Harlem Fashion Show &amp; Style Awards earlier this week; \u201cJoy\u201d by a 1986 sweater dress emblazoned with a heart shaped breastplate of colourful buttons by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/apr/25/patrick-kelly-exhibition-fashion-designer\">Patrick Kelly</a>, the first American and first black designer admitted to the prestigious Chambre Syndicale du pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter des couturiers et des cr\u00e9ateurs de mode. This vocabulary is chosen to reflect the heightened emotional tone of America\u2019s political climate and a new era of individualism in its fashion industry. The power of the once-mighty department store is fading, and with it the age of the identikit wardrobe.</p> <p>The show is pieced together like a quilt. \u201cA quilt seems to me a much better metaphor for American fashion than the melting pot,\u201d says Bolton. \u201cThe melting pot is about homogeneity, whereas a quilt brings together heterogenous voices.\u201d In 1984, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jesse-jackson\">Rev Jesse Jackson</a> told the Democratic National Convention that \u201cAmerica is not like a blanket, one piece of unbroken cloth, the same color, the same texture, the same size \u2026 America is more like a quilt: many patches, many pieces, many colors, many sizes, all woven and held together by a common thread\u201d. This speech was the starting point for the quilt as an organisational principle, intended to \u201celevate pluralism\u201d, says Bolton.</p> <p>On Monday evening, however, the world will see a more lighthearted side to the show, as Met Gala attendees interpret a dress code of \u201cAmerican independence\u201d on the red carpet. Bolton expects \u201ca few stars and stripes, and Statue of Liberty looks\u201d. Anna Wintour has said she intends to pay homage to the Dominican-born American couturier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/oscar-de-la-renta\">Oscar de la Renta</a>, who died in 2014. </p> <p>Among the ballgowns and fancy dress, Bolton is hoping for \u201ca real showcase of young talent. It might look more like a montage of New York fashion week than a traditional red carpet.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Benjamin Monk, a police officer who used and abused his power to kill the former footballer Dalian Atkinson, is now over a year into an eight-year prison sentence for manslaughter. Yet, for legal reasons, only now \u2013 after his fellow arresting officer Mary Ellen Bettley-Smith was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/28/police-officer-cleared-assault-former-footballer-dalian-atkinson\">cleared of assaulting </a>the former footballer \u2013 are we free to comment on the case.</p> <p>No one who heard about this killing \u2013 certainly no one who has, like me and so many others, pulled on a police uniform and endeavoured to serve the public \u2013 can ever forget it.</p> <p>Monk, then an officer with the West Mercia force, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-57603091\">Tasered Atkinson for 33 seconds</a> \u2013 six times longer than is standard. When Atkinson fell to the ground, Monk kicked him at least twice with such force that his bootlaces left an imprint on his forehead. While doing this, Monk shouted \u201cfucking hit him!\u201d to Bettley-Smith, with whom he was in a relationship at the time. She struck Atkinson three times with a baton.</p> <p>Eyewitnesses described Monk as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/04/dalian-atkinson-murdered-in-street-by-police-officer-jury-hears\">kicking the shit</a>\u201d out of the former Aston Villa striker, and kicking his head like a football as he lay motionless on the ground. And when another officer arrived on the scene, he noticed that Monk was resting his foot on Atkinson\u2019s head.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/28/police-officer-cleared-assault-former-footballer-dalian-atkinson\">Dalian Atkinson\u2019s family condemns justice system for six-year delay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A jury found Monk not guilty of murder last year but convicted him of the alternative charge of unlawful act manslaughter. And with another jury at Birmingham crown court giving their <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/pc-cleared-of-assaulting-former-footballer-dalian-atkinson-before-he-died-12706977\">verdict on Bettley-Smith</a> on Wednesday, proceedings on this case have finally ended, six years after Atkinson\u2019s killing.</p> <p>Despite the delays it\u2019s vital now that there is a public debate \u2013 that we consider the true gravity of what happened and what it means for policing. Monk\u2019s conviction was the <a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/dalian-atkinson-verdict\">first time in 35 years</a> that an officer has been found guilty over a death in the line of duty. It\u2019s believed to be the first time ever for a Black victim. In my time as an officer I saw other deaths in police contact cases where, despite seemingly compelling evidence \u2013 and in some cases after an unlawful killing verdict at the inquest \u2013 there was never any criminal conviction, and often no trial at all.</p> <p>Some will compare Monk\u2019s actions with those of the Minneapolis officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/25/derek-chauvin-george-floyd-murder-sentencing\">Derek Chauvin</a>, who took the life of George Floyd. Both officers used sustained and unacceptable levels of force long after their victim posed any risk.</p> <p>And though racism was not raised as an issue in Monk\u2019s trial, it seems clear that the UK and US police have similar cultures when it comes to the policing of Black communities. In both countries Black men are disproportionately on the receiving end of excessive force that can lead to their death. The Independent Office for Police Conduct is currently investigating allegations surrounding the shooting of unarmed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/25/chris-kabas-family-back-call-for-un-to-examine-police-shooting\">Chris Kaba</a>, in south London this month.</p> <p>The disparity is shocking: in England and Wales, Black people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/dec/17/black-people-five-times-more-likely-to-be-subjected-to-police-force\">five times more likely</a> to have force used on them, and are seven times more likely to be Tasered than white people. White officers often try to justify their actions by the fear they felt. Monk himself told the court that Atkinson \u201cwas too big and intimidating \u2026 I was no match for him\u201d. This year we saw the horrific death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/aug/22/chelsea-bridge-death-oladeji-omishore-man-tasered-by-police-was-clearly-in-distress-say-family\">Oladeji Omishore</a> who, after being repeatedly Tasered on Chelsea Bridge in London, leapt to his death in the River Thames. His family believe the Taser should never have been used.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"486b3b9f103a6b55205766cefe95bdb588828ac7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/486b3b9f103a6b55205766cefe95bdb588828ac7/0_343_2272_1363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police constable Benjamin Monk, who was convicted of unlawful act manslaughter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police constable Benjamin Monk, who was convicted of unlawful act manslaughter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The use of excess force appears to be even more acute when a Black suspect suffers from mental ill health. Mental ill health was a factor in the cases of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/aug/16/kevin-clarke-death-police-watchdog-reopens-investigation\">Kevin Clarke</a> (an inquest found inappropriate police restraint contributed to his death), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jun/21/sheku-bayoh-inquiry-former-pc-denies-telling-grandfather-he-was-racist\">Sheku Bayoh</a>, whose death is currently the subject of an independent public inquiry, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/oct/03/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation\">Roger Sylvester</a> (an inquest jury\u2019s verdict of unlawful killing was subsequently overturned), among others. Dalian Atkinson had been behaving erratically on the night of his death, leading concerned neighbours to call the police. In cases of this nature the person should be treated more like a patient and less like a criminal, so that officers do their best to de-escalate the situation and are less likely to lose control.</p> <p>We know what should be happening. Victor Adebowale\u2019s report on the <a href=\"https://amhp.org.uk/turning-point-independent-commission-on-mental-health-and-policing-report/\">policing of mental health</a> is there for all to see but is just not being adhered to.</p> <p>As an officer for 30 years, I saw how Black men\u2019s behaviour can be seen as threatening and aggressive by less-informed officers, and how their stereotyping or racial profiling creates a presumption that heavy-handed tactics are the only option.</p> <p>Many people say it\u2019s the \u201ca few bad apples\u201d scenario. However, I have always asked myself, \u201cWhat are the good apples doing about it to challenge the excessively violent officers?\u201d</p> <p>As a sergeant I once had to pull an officer off a Black prisoner in the custody office when it was clear that person no longer posed a threat. On that occasion the officers were correct in restraining this aggressive prisoner on the floor, because he refused to be searched and I feared he had drugs concealed on him. However, one officer continued to put pressure on the person\u2019s back even after the search had taken place, and I had to haul him away to prevent any restrictions to the prisoner\u2019s breathing. In similar incidences involving violent white prisoners I never once encountered officers using this level of force.</p> <p>On another occasion I had to tell my constables to stand down as I successfully convinced a Black male \u2013 clearly suffering from a psychotic episode \u2013 that he had to go to hospital in a police van. He\u2019d previously been trussed up like an animal by white officers, with handcuffs and leg ties. As before, I\u2019ve never seen officers treat white suspects like this.<br><br>Most officers are reasonable and know how to use their powers within clear boundaries, mainly because they realise what it means to be a public servant \u2013 to protect and serve regardless of a person\u2019s postcode, ethnicity, culture or appearances.<br><br>Yet it\u2019s clear that even now, insufficient work is being done by Britain\u2019s police leadership to deal with rogue officers. We\u2019ve had enough: this case must mean something. It must be a wake-up call for chiefs to get a grip and deal with the officers before more cases of excessive force, and potentially needless deaths, occur. We have waited a long time to have this discussion, but Dalian Atkinson and his still grieving family deserve no less.</p> <ul> <li><p>Leroy Logan is a former superintendent in the Metropolitan police and a former chair of the Black Police Association.

Some said that, although law enforcement, journalists and researchers regularly monitor public online activity, it was troubling that a police agency\u2019s social media monitoring activities appeared to include tracking a broad swath of critics. And the partnership also raised questions about oversight of surveillance technology, as well as police agencies\u2019 data collection practices.</p> <p>LAPD\u2019s test run with Edge NPD came as law enforcement agencies have increasingly been forced to take their investigations online, and have sought tools to do so.

It\u2019s hard to understand how LAPD would even be processing all of this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt creates a much larger haystack of data that doesn\u2019t actually lead to any real, tangible, positive outcome for communities,\u201d said Steven Renderos, executive director of the national racial justice organization Media Justice. \u201cInstead it just equips the police department with more data that helps it kind of justify its own efforts to to tell a better story about itself.\u201d</p> <p>He pointed out that the list included keywords such as \u201cdomestic extremism\u201d and \u201cracist\u201d that were purportedly intended to capture tweets about white supremacy. \u201cNo one is describing themselves as a domestic extremist,\u201d Renderos said. \u201cInstead you then start filtering in tweets and messages from people who are merely \u2026 protesting white supremacy. Take these keywords together and what it\u2019s actually doing is capturing a subset of thought and dissent among people.

Those revelations prompted Facebook to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/18/facebook-lapd-social-media-surveillance-fake-accounts\">demand</a> that LAPD stop collecting data on its platform for surveillance.</p> <p>Activists caught up in the surveillance said they were not surprised. The software flagged tweets by Bree Newsome Bass, who received <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/27/woman-removes-confederate-flag-south-carolina-statehouse\">national attention</a> in 2015 when she climbed a flagpole to remove a confederate flag at the South Carolina statehouse. In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1326312055033507840\">thread</a> included in the files, Newsome Bass advocated for demilitarizing police and putting funding toward mental health first responders. \u201cThe resistance to defunding police is 100% about racism &amp; normalizing the daily violence police forces inflict on marginalized communities for the benefit of ruling classes,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s political targeting,\u201d Newsome Bass told the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen instance after instance where police agencies are focused more on policing Black people who are demanding equality and civil rights than actually preventing any violence \u2026 They\u2019re making the case for defunding the police even further. They\u2019re using taxpayer dollars to monitor our social media where we\u2019re talking about how we\u2019re wasting money on police.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing violent or criminal about saying \u2018defund the police\u2019,\u201d added Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter LA. \u201cWe have a right to say \u2018defund the police\u2019.

He said the service identified roughly a dozen alerts related to possible threats and provided examples of tweets about protest clashes and about Dodgers fans allegedly engaging in vandalism while celebrating.</p> <p>He stressed his firm is not a defense contractor, and the service was not intended to monitor specific activists: \u201cThis was not for actually analyzing the members of the Black Lives Matter movement.\u201d</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2021-12/J1-Thank%20you%20letter.pdf\">thank you letter</a> to the company after the trial, an LAPD official said ABTShield had surfaced \u201cthreat-related content\u201d and \u201cenabled us to more efficiently analyze this barrage of data\u201d. The service helps \u201cparse out the proverbial \u2018signal from the noise\u2019\u201d, the official said.

He noted that last year, BLMLA facilitated a community-driven <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-15/black-lives-matter-lapd-spending-peoples-budget-los-angeles-city-council\">process</a> to present a proposed \u201cpeople\u2019s budget\u201d that cut LAPD funding. \u201cThere\u2019s an organic and growing awareness of the reallocating of resources from the police.\u201d</p> <p>LAPD did not move forward with a formal contract with Edge, though has remained interested in this kind of service, with records showing the department bought or pursued software from at least 10 companies that monitor social media.</p> <p>Last week, Twitter said it had suspended ABTShield\u2019s developer account based on evidence that the firm violated its policies by deviating from approved uses, though the company did not elaborate further on the decision. Twitter\u2019s policies allow for public data to be used for \u201cnews alerting\u201d and \u201cfirst responder support\u201d, but it <a href=\"https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/more-on-restricted-use-cases\">prohibits</a> surveillance of \u201csensitive groups\u201d, such as activist organizations.</p> <p>A Twitter spokesperson, Shaokyi Amdo, said in a statement: \u201cTwitter prohibits the use of our developer services for surveillance purposes. Period. We proactively enforce our policies to ensure customers are in compliance and will continue to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future, a digital rights group, said there should be stronger restrictions against the broad collection of social media data and the analysis law enforcement may perform on it.</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t fully grasp the ways in which the ability to analyze data at a mass scale changes the game. There\u2019s a difference between you tweeting something and knowing that it may be seen in public, and you tweeting something and knowing that it can be vacuumed up and analyzed in a million different ways using artificial intelligence and machine learning.\u201d</p>"

After Hamilton wore a T-shirt bearing the words \u201cArrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor\u201d at the Tuscan GP, Petrov was scathing. \u201cFor me, this T-shirt, on top of calling for everyone to kneel, was too much,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to call on that in Formula One itself \u2026 I think half of the spectators didn\u2019t even know what the shirt was about until it was explained to them.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s say a driver admits to being gay.

The team have yet to reveal who will replace them but Mick Schumacher, who is part of the Ferrari academy, is being linked to one of the seats. The team principal, G\u00fcnther Steiner, admitted they would have to consider drivers with financial backing, when asked what he was looking for.</p> <p>\u201cMoney and talent. I mean, talent always needs to be there, not only money,\u201d he said. \u201cSo talent is very important, or more important, but some people have got sponsorship they bring with them.

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-donald-trump-white-house-washington-police-brutality-minneapolis-latest-news-updates\">protests in dozens of cities</a> have stemmed from what Colbert called the \u201cextrajudicial execution\u201d of George Floyd by Derek Chauvin, a white on-duty Minneapolis police officer who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck for nine minutes. \u201cNow, in civilized countries, that\u2019s called murder,\u201d said Colbert.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuU-SHQljDQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RuU-SHQljDQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And yet, despite video evidence of the entire interaction, it took four days for Chauvin to be arrested and charged with third-degree murder; the three other officers involved, who watched but did not intervene, have not been charged with any crime. \u201cSo if you\u2019re wondering why people are so upset, it\u2019s because this is so upsetting.\u201d</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s killing comes on the heels of the murder of Breonna Taylor, an emergency technician shot by police in her home in Louisville, Kentucky, in April, and Ahmaud Arbery, shot by two white men in Georgia while out for a jog in February, which \u201calso has eerie similarities to Eric Garner in 2014\u201d, said Colbert. \u201cAnd in that same year there was the case of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Tamir Rice in Cleveland. All of those echo Emmett Till and the Scottsboro Boys, which happened in the context of Jim Crow, which itself was a soft relaunch of slavery. So you\u2019ve really got to go back to the Triangle trade, which ultimately stems from man\u2019s inhumanity to man, and our essential fallen nature. So, maybe start with the Garden of Eden.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/29/jimmy-kimmel-trump-twitter-late-night\">Jimmy Kimmel: 'If Trump is so mad at Twitter, why doesn\u2019t he stop using it?'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The point is: this is nothing new, and \u201cwe need empathetic and moral leadership. Unfortunately, we have Donald Trump.</p> <p>&nbsp;\u201cNow, I make a lot of jokes about Donald Trump because he is a dull and dark corrupting force that is undermining America\u2019s moral leadership around the world and sowing hatred and fear among his own citizens,\u201d said Colbert. \u201cAnd during this Covid crisis, the president has totally abdicated his responsibility of leading the people to understand the need to do the right thing for themselves and each other. And yet, the large majority of Americans have done the right thing anyway. And my hope is that the American people will do the same thing now, because ultimately, they have to.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cFor too long, those of us with opportunity and privilege have failed in our responsibility to look at the truth squarely and name the system of racial oppression that artificially divides Americans and benefits those already in positions of relative power,\u201d Colbert continued.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to ask ourselves, as it is always time to ask ourselves, what kind of nation do we want to live in? That answer requires moral leadership. So take it upon yourself to be a leader and set an example for the kind of country you want to live in.\u201d</p> <h2>Seth Meyers</h2> <p>\u201cIf you had any doubts at all about the dangers of our overly militarized police culture, those doubts were answered in the response to nationwide protests over the murder of George Floyd,\u201d said Seth Meyers on Late Night, citing numerous examples of police being \u201cneedlessly violent\u201d or escalating encounters with peaceful protesters for seemingly no reason.&nbsp;</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqgzTwY6ZYk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aqgzTwY6ZYk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cThe police can\u2019t even get through protests about police brutality without committing more police brutality,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like if your wife accused you of having an affair in divorce court, and you tried to smooth it over by seducing the judge.</p> <p>\u201cEven just showing up to a protest in riot gear with military equipment is a form of escalation,\u201d Meyers continued as he played footage from police rolling through the streets of Columbia, South Carolina, with a tank. \u201cAsk yourself: why do local police departments have tanks when doctors and nurses can\u2019t even get masks and gowns? We spend billions on military equipment for police and healthcare workers have to wear snorkel masks like retirees on vacation in the Caribbean. There are teachers in this country who are drowning in debt and have to spend their own money on supplies for their classrooms. If anyone deserves a tank, it\u2019s them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/01/john-oliver-when-trump-uses-thugs-code-racism-george-floyd-protests\">John Oliver: When Trump 'uses the word thugs, you know what it\u2019s code for'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We know police escalation isn\u2019t necessary, Meyers added, because \u201cjust a few weeks ago, police were physically confronted by angry rightwing protesters calling for an end to lockdowns, and oddly, they seemed to have left their tanks and teargas at home.\u201d</p> <p>In the face of police escalation, \u201cthe very least we can do, the absolute minimum, is to acknowledge there is a deeply rooted, systemic problem here,\u201d Meyers concluded, which is \u201cthat there\u2019s a predatory system with a history of police misconduct built on a legacy of racism and exploitation that elevates the comfort and security of white people over the health and safety of black people\u201d.</p> <h2>Jimmy Fallon</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMpbwODjNTA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XMpbwODjNTA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And on the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon offered \u201ca different kind of show\u201d \u2013 a mea culpa after it was reported last week that Fallon had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/us/jimmy-fallon-chris-rock-blackface.html\">once donned blackface to impersonate Chris Rock</a> during his time at Saturday Night Live. Fallon said he was \u201chorrified\u201d that the story emerged, \u201cnot at the fact that people were trying to cancel me or cancel the show, which is scary enough, but the thing that haunted me the most was how do I say: \u2018I love this person? I respect this guy more than I respect most humans. I am not racist, I don\u2019t feel this way.\u2019&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cInstead, what I kept getting advised was to just stay quiet and not say anything,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the advice because we\u2019re all afraid.

And we need to say \u2018that\u2019s not OK\u2019 more than just one day on Twitter,\u201d Fallon urged. \u201cWe can\u2019t just hope that everyone loves each other.

But the authors\u2019 focus is overwhelmingly on the <em>positive</em> effects of Twitter and Black Twitter, which they argue have democratized access to information, and the power of the smartphone to provide the incontrovertible video evidence needed to prosecute the murderers of men like George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery.</p> <p>The book is a brisk, smart, short history of the effects of new communication technologies, from the photographs of the 19th century to the movies and television of the 20th and the internet of our own time.</p> <p>It includes terrific mini-portraits of many of the heroes and several of the villains of the Black-and-white battle which has dominated so much of American history, including the great Black abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, who turns out to be the most photographed American of the 19th century, and the white supremacist Thomas Dixon Jr, whose novel The Clansman was the basis for the 1915 film The Birth of a Nation.</p> <p>There is a great section about the impact of The Birth of the Nation, which single-handedly revived the Ku Klux Klan and did more to rewrite the history of Reconstruction than any other book or movie. Its director, DW Griffith, was frank about wanting to give white southerners \u201ca way of striking back\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOne could not find the sufferings of our family and our friends \u2013 the dreadful poverty and hardships during the war and for many years after \u2013 in the Yankee-written histories we read in school,\u201d Griffith wrote. \u201cFrom all this was born a burning determination to tell \u2026 our side of the story to the world.\u201d</p> <p>As the authors note: \u201cHis movie did that spectacularly.\u201d</p> <p>The book also reminds us that this was the first movie shown in the White House and the host, Woodrow Wilson, was a friend and Johns Hopkins classmate of Thomas Dixon Jr. Wilson, of course, was also the president who allowed the segregation of the federal government.</p> <p>But what makes this volume especially valuable is the authors\u2019 capacity to see the good and the bad in almost everything.</p> <p>WEB Du Bois said The Birth of the Nation represented \u201cthe Negro\u201d either \u201cas an ignorant fool, a vicious rapist, a venal or unscrupulous politician, or a faithful but doddering idiot\u201d. James Baldwin called it \u201can elaborate justification of mass murder\u201d.</p> <p>And yet the film was so egregious it also had a tremendous positive effect \u2013 it \u201cdid more to advance the NAACP\u201d, which had been founded six years earlier, \u201cthan anything else to that date. In essence it jump-started the movement for civil rights.\u201d At that time, that term did not yet have any meaning.</p> <p>Du Bois and the NAACP hoped to hit back \u201cin kind\u201d with a movie called Lincoln\u2019s Dream but were stymied by \u201cthe lack of enthusiasm\u201d of white capital.</p> <p>In our own time, Hill and Brewster identify the unique power of the video of the murder of George Floyd, which \u201cresonated with whites because the cruelty inflicted on him was so undeniable, so elemental \u2026 and so protracted (nine minutes 29 seconds) that it could be neither ignored nor dismissed\u201d.</p> <p>For Black people of course it was much more personal: as they watched \u201cthe last breaths being squeezed from Floyd\u2019s body, they could see themselves in his suffering; or an uncle, or a sister, or even a long-departed ancestor\u201d.</p> <p>A beautiful mini-biography of James Baldwin includes many of his most pungent observations, including, \u201cNot everything that is faced can be changed; but nothing can be changed until it is faced.\u201d And, \u201cTo be a Negro in this country, and to be relatively conscious, is to be in a rage almost all the time\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/22/a-lynching-at-port-jervis-book-review-new-york-race-hate\">A Lynching at Port Jervis review: timely history of New York race hate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It turns out that \u201cone of the most frequently cited BLM counterpublic voices is Baldwin\u2019s\u201d.

Joe Biden observed last week: \u201cI don\u2019t know any good cop who likes a bad cop.\u201d Chauvin was sentenced to 22-and-a-half years in prison.</p> <p>Chauvin had been a \u201cbad cop\u201d for a long time. Star Tribune reporters found that there had been at least two dozen complaints against him over 18 years; all but two of them were dismissed without any disciplinary measures.</p> <p>The reporters also teamed up with Frontline to interview people who never filed complaints and uncovered film footage of Chauvin\u2019s aggressive use of force against them. In one clip, Chauvin pins a Black female suspect to the ground with his knee and she cries: \u201cCan you get off my neck?\u201d</p> <p>The never-before-seen videos highlight how Minneapolis police failed to act on warning signs about Chauvin\u2019s misconduct. Police on Trial also contains interviews with former senior police officers who say they faced repercussions for speaking out about problems within the department.</p> <p>Speaking from his apartment in St Paul, Minnesota, Shum, 37, observes: \u201cThis type of behaviour that he had been exhibiting, his degree of use of force, had been going on for quite some time and was approved by his supervisors.</p> <p>\u201cIf that wasn\u2019t held to account, what were the issues of holding people accountable within the department? It was both shocking but also not surprising to the extent that there is a culture in place in this department that makes it hard to hold each other accountable.</p> <p>\u201cYou had good cops trying to do good work. But one bad officer amidst a number of good officers? It\u2019s not that clear and simple because you\u2019d hope that the accountability allows for those good officers to say something. When they don\u2019t it makes it worse and, when they do, it makes it hard for them too. So it\u2019s a strange conundrum, at least in that department, to address those systemic issues.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebeb3fcf84308e55821e82c8cf8110ac71dff66b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebeb3fcf84308e55821e82c8cf8110ac71dff66b/0_112_5349_3209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Minneapolis protest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Minneapolis protest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Minnesota department of human rights <a href=\"https://mn.gov/mdhr/assets/Investigation%20into%20the%20City%20of%20Minneapolis%20and%20the%20Minneapolis%20Police%20Department_tcm1061-526417.pdf\">has found</a> that the city\u2019s police engaged in a pattern of racial discrimination over the past decade. Police efforts to win back public trust suffered a fresh setback in February when an officer shot dead Amir Locke, 22, in an apartment during a \u201cno-knock\u201d raid and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/06/amir-locke-death-no-charges-police-officer\">faced no criminal charges</a>.</p> <p>The film-makers gained rare access to ride along with rank-and-file officers such as William Gregory, who had recently been accused of punching a teenager in the face (the city eventually <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/damareion-mckizzie-sues-minneapolis-police-settles-for-50k/600169171/\">settled out of court</a>). Gregory says, \u201cto me it was just a job before George Floyd. You came in, you answered your call and then you went home. But now people treat us like we are truly the enemy.\u201d</p> <p>Shum adds: \u201cTo what extent reform is operating in a way that changes how the police department\u2019s interacting with the community, I\u2019m not entirely sure there\u2019s been enough changes, or at least ones that make it feel meaningful. Since the death of Amir Locke, there is a sort of ripple effect of trauma that\u2019s emanated from George Floyd\u2019s killing.\u201d</p> <p>The same question nags nationally two years on: after all the hope and energy and sense of possibility, how much has truly changed? As the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> signs that dotted front gardens two summers ago begin to shrivel, and the national consciousness is constantly distracted by crises from Uvalde to Ukraine, was this yet another false dawn?</p> <p>Police shot and killed at least 1,055 people last year \u2013 a record, according to a<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2022/02/09/fatal-police-shootings-record-2021/\"> count by the Washington Post</a>. Momentum stalled after Congress failed to reach a bipartisan agreement on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. And there is a rightwing backlash against the teaching of so-called \u201ccritical race theory\u201d in schools.</p> <p>Ben Crump, a civil rights lawyer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AttorneyCrump/status/1529469238741712896?s=20&amp;t=QStW0ix3juUKmOYCfQrM6g\">tweeted on last week\u2019s anniversary</a>, \u201c2 years later &amp; Black people still can\u2019t breathe. George Floyd\u2019s brutal death sparked an unprecedented outpouring of outrage and pledges for change worldwide, &amp; we CANNOT stop fighting now. We must continue to make our voices heard. Our lives depend on it. #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most striking scenes in Police on Trial shows Jacob Frey, the young Democratic mayor of Minneapolis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/08/shame-minneapolis-mayor-heckled-by-protesters-video\">confronted by protesters</a> on 6 June 2020. A woman with a microphone asks him, \u201cYes or no, will you commit to defunding the Minneapolis police department?\u201d She then tells the crowd: \u201cHe\u2019s up for re-election next year and if he says no, guess what the fuck we\u2019re gonna do next year!\u201d</p> <p>Frey, wearing face mask, T-shirt and jeans, replies, \u201cI do not support the full abolition of the police.\u201d The crowd erupts in fury. Someone shouts, \u201cGet the fuck out of here!\u201d A plastic bottle is thrown at Frey. There are boos and chants of \u201cGo home, Jacob, go home!\u201d and \u201cShame!\u201d The mayor walks through the baying crowd in what one reporter likens to a scene from the TV drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/30/game-of-thrones-best-tv-2010s\">Game of Thrones</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3966154c2375018e02c129eaac5bfbb429a7fbe4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3966154c2375018e02c129eaac5bfbb429a7fbe4/0_151_4524_2714/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Crump and Jacob Frey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Crump and Jacob Frey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shum recalls, \u201cWhen I saw that material I thought, this is kind of an unbelievable sight: the mayor is getting booed off this street by protesters. I don\u2019t know that this would be happening in other cities right now.</p> <p>\u201cThe unimaginable aspect of it was very clear and moreover, the next day, when you have city council members vowing to end the police, I would say that is where the germination of the documentary was in play. It\u2019s not just this one moment: we\u2019re going to see something happen here in the city that I think a lot of other cities could learn from.\u201d</p> <p>But last November Frey was re-elected and more than 56% of Minneapolis residents <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/11/02/1051617581/minneapolis-police-vote\">rejected a ballot proposal</a> that would have in effect replaced the police department with a public safety department that emphasised public health. Nationally, with crime on the rise, the phrase \u201cdefund the police\u201d has come to be seen by centrist Democrats as counterproductive and a symbol of progressive overreach.</p> <p>Shum comments: \u201cAs much as the measure failed, there was still 40% yes, which is a significant percentage of the population. That\u2019s something that has been lost in some ways: there\u2019s still a lot of people who are looking to dismantle the department.</p> <p>\u201cAnd yet I think what\u2019s clear from the polls that we did with Star Tribune, as well as the election, is this is a complicated issue that\u2019s tough for people to just have a clear sense of what should be done to \u2018solve\u2019 this issue of public safety.\u201d</p> <p>Shum sought to capture this complexity in his film. \u201cI was intrigued by showing that struggle because it\u2019s not a simple conversation to have and it\u2019s important for every city to constantly keep figuring this out. If there\u2019s any takeaway for audiences here in Minneapolis and St Paul, it\u2019s that the struggle shouldn\u2019t end. It\u2019s an important thing to keep coming back to \u2013 a larger conversation around public safety.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Police on Trial airs on PBS on 31 May and will be available to stream on PBS.org/frontline, YouTube and in the PBS Video App</p>"

     "body": "<p>When fiddle player Kimber Ludiker visited Colorado last month, she had just spent 10 days in bed with Covid. \u201cThe altitude was really hard on my poor recovering lungs,\u201d says Ludiker, one of the founding members of bluegrass band Della Mae. But the trip was too special to miss: she and Avril Smith, her bandmate and partner, were taking Smith\u2019s 11-year-old daughter to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/18/dixie-chicks-used-and-abused-by-everybody-who-wanted-to-make-money-off-us\">the Chicks</a>. \u201cAnd honestly,\u201d says Ludiker, \u201cthere would be no Della Mae without the Chicks.\u201d</p> <p>In the same way that the Dallas trio broke new ground to dominate country music, Della Mae have become the most influential all-women band in bluegrass. And as a majority queer, fiercely feminist five-piece acoustic outfit, they also sing fearlessly on topics that might rile the genre\u2019s traditionally conservative audiences. Recent albums have covered everything from domestic violence and fertility issues to the separation of families at the US border with Mexico. They also play barnstorming numbers about motorbikes and bourbon.</p> <p>Their live shows are foot-stomping, crowd-pleasing riots, full of the kind of high-octane instrumental skills that the band \u2013 now in its twelfth year and its third incarnation \u2013 was always intended to showcase. Ludiker has always been frustrated at the lack of female representation in music, where women are still most usually seen in the guise of lead singers or backing vocalists. \u201cIt was hard for me to even think about being involved in music when across most genres you don\u2019t see women who are<strong> </strong>sidemen,\u201d she says, before catching herself. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the word we use!

Two years ago, they released Headlight, a soul-stirring collection of songs about being a woman in modern America that took their acoustic sound further into Americana territory with its mix of gospel, rock and funk. Their fifth and most recent album includes swing, waltz and honky tonk alongside its bluegrass vibe; it\u2019s called Family Reunion for the joy they felt at being reunited in the studio after the pandemic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/15/how-bluegrass-became-americas-new-sound-of-political-protest\">Plucked from obscurity: why bluegrass is making a comeback</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One track that has become a radio favourite in the US is Ride Away, loosely inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/richard-thompson\">Richard Thompson</a>\u2019s classic 1952 Vincent Black Lightning. It\u2019s Woodsmith\u2019s attempt to write her own motorcycle tale of tragedy, although in classic Della Mae style there\u2019s a very emphatic commentary hidden within it on how parents pass down their wounds to their children. Meanwhile, The Way It Was Before covers modern slavery, mass shootings and<em> </em>the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of flashpoints in America and we managed to choose all of them,\u201d says Woodsmith. Among the true stories it tells is that of Kevin Mahoney, who had just found out he was going to become a grandfather when he was killed alongside nine others in a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado.</p> <p>Woodsmith says writing the song was a \u201cvery tender\u201d process, but its first performance was even more poignant, at a festival just one town along from where Mahoney was murdered. \u201cThere were people in the audience who had been personally affected by that tragedy,\u201d says Ludiker. \u201cPerforming it in that context was really intense.\u201d Sometimes, especially when they are performing in more conservative regions, they will strategise how they introduce their more political songs to ensure they\u2019re heard in the right spirit. \u201cYou want people to listen with an open mind, not just get up and walk out. Most of the discourse we have with people in real life is positive \u2013 even if they disagree with us, people who want their guns aren\u2019t fans of them being used to kill people.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8fwnCa9oo8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I8fwnCa9oo8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The band\u2019s name comes from the chorus of Big Spike Hammer, by the Osborne Brothers. Della Mae is an archetype of the woman who does her man wrong in bluegrass songs, and they liked the idea of reclaiming it \u2013 as Ludiker says, \u201cstanding up and saying to the man, you know what? It\u2019s probably your fault.\u201d</p> <p>Their feminism has been a defining character of their music \u2013 they often have audience members approach them after shows to thank them for the title track of Headlight, an anthem to women who have suffered domestic abuse. On a touring circuit dominated by male bands, playing the kind of music frequently referred to as \u201cmacho\u201d and \u201chigh-testosterone\u201d, Della Mae were considered a novelty in their early years on the road. Although this wasn\u2019t new to Ludiker, a fifth-generation fiddler who spent her youth competing in Texas-style fiddle contests, just as her father Tony had before her. (Her mother JayDean still teaches and competes; thanks to her parents\u2019 efforts, Spokane, Washington is now renowned as a fiddling mecca.)</p> <p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t the<strong> </strong>first all-female bluegrass band, but we were the only one touring at the time\u201d says Ludiker. It brought them welcome opportunities. It also brought plenty of unwanted attention. Their sound engineer was constantly asked which of them he was sleeping with; there were wandering hands and dick pics, and enough attempts to follow them or get into their green room that they all took a self-defence course.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/24/i-was-running-away-from-poverty-the-remarkable-rise-of-bluegrass-virtuoso-billy-strings\">\u2018I was running away from poverty\u2019: the remarkable rise of bluegrass virtuoso Billy Strings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As cultural ambassadors for the US state department, the band have also taken bluegrass to some pretty unlikely places, including Guyana, Barbados, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. \u201cI\u2019m still in touch with a woman I met in Pakistan in 2012,\u201d says Woodsmith. \u201cShe\u2019s been teaching me how to sing some of her songs. That\u2019s the type of connection we want, isn\u2019t it? Friendships that can last over a decade with people who are vastly different. Maybe when you have that you can have a world that feels a little safer.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, as she acknowledges, there are places that Della Mae no longer feel comfortable travelling. With the return of Smith \u2013 the band\u2019s founding guitarist left in 2011 to have her daughter \u2013 and with the arrival of mandolinist Maddie Witler, who identifies as queer and is bisexual, the band now has a major queer contingent. (Though Witler isn\u2019t joining their upcoming UK dates.)<strong> </strong>\u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d says Woodsmith, \u201cbut there are places where it is really and truly not safe for LGBTQ+ people and we\u2019re a bit more aware of the repercussions of what could happen.\u201d</p> <p>While they are encouraged by how many more female instrumentalists they see in bluegrass now compared to when they started, their sense of mission remains. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to us,\u201d says Ludiker, \u201cbecause without that touring doesn\u2019t feel as fulfilling.\u201d</p> <p>Her next plan is to form<strong> </strong>a non-profit organisation that subsidises female touring musicians and take away one of the main excuses used by the more traditional bluegrass bands for not hiring women. \u201cA lot of people have told me the reason is because they\u2019re on a budget and having a woman means an extra hotel room and not sharing with the men,\u201d says Ludiker. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll buy that hotel room for them, so now what\u2019s your reason? Because obviously it\u2019s not the lack of talent.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.dellamae.com/tour\">Della Mae\u2019s UK tour</a> begins at Caroline Street Social Club in Shipley on 25 August. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 August 2022 to reflect that Maddie Wither prefers to identify as queer and bisexual.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Martin Luther King Jr famously said, \u201cThe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\u201d President Obama was fond of the saying and used it often \u2013 but it could do with a second part. The arc of the moral universe does not bend on its own. It is bent in the right direction by protesters, campaigners and dissenters. It was their hands that forced it towards justice last week, when the former police officer Derek Chauvin was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">found guilty</a> of the second-degree murder of George Floyd. We cannot celebrate and take comfort in the verdict that was meted out without acknowledging the action outside the courtroom that secured it.</p> <p>But this is what some will do: claim the verdict to be a great victory, after denigrating the means by which it was achieved. The protests in the wake of Floyd\u2019s murder have been called the largest <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html\">in US and global history</a>. They reached more than 50 countries. In the US, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/black-lives-matter-90-million-finances-8a80cad199f54c0c4b9e74283d27366f\">tens of millions of dollars</a> were raised and invested in grassroots communities and advocacy in a diffuse, decentralised network that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/us/protest-personal-homes-doxxing.html\">lobbied politicians</a> and pushed through <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/voter-registration-surged-during-blm-protests-study-finds-n1236331\">voter registration</a>. It all made a deep impression on the public consciousness. Chauvin quite simply would not have been brought to trial on these charges, let alone been convicted, were it not for these tireless efforts.</p> <p>What will now unfold is an exercise in whitewashing, erasing those unruly, non-state actors from the history of the Chauvin verdict. His conviction will be framed as something that came about as a result of the integrity of the justice system. His crime will be seen as a policing malfunction that was caught, unfortunately too late for George Floyd, but in time for the US to learn and move forward. \u201cThank you, George Floyd, for sacrificing your life for justice,\u201d said Nancy Pelosi, after the verdict was announced. Floyd here is merely a passive martyr whose death gave the system an opportunity to redeem itself.</p> <p>But the system doesn\u2019t work. And more importantly, it wouldn\u2019t have worked had officialdom been trusted. From the moment a teenager\u2019s mobile phone camera began recording, when Floyd was being restrained, the evidence of Chauvin\u2019s crime was crowdsourced. The original police report, which called his death a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/george-floyd-police-report-murder-b1834832.html\">medical incident</a>\u201d, gives a chilling insight into the different path the case might have taken had there been no footage. The media then did its own citizen\u2019s investigation, unearthing Chauvin\u2019s long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-killing-officers-derek-chauvin-tou-thao-investigated\">record of complaints of misdemeanours</a>. The moral outrage for the murder did not come from politicians. It was brought to their doors by a movement of people who knew that, within the legal system, the dead Floyd would likely have no advocates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/22/derek-chauvin-verdict-police-race-us\">There\u2019s hope for racial justice in America. But it comes from the people \u2013 not the courts | Simon Balto</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some of those politicians are now shimmying to catch a bit of Floyd\u2019s halo. The New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, said that \u201cjustice was served\u201d after \u201cthe reality of racism in this nation finally hit a boiling point\u201d. But he <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-york-mayor-bill-de-blasio-defends-police-after-video-n1220246\">defended police</a> driving into protesters<strong> </strong>who had reached that boiling point, saying that it was \u201cinappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers\u201d. In the UK, Boris Johnson \u201cwelcomed\u201d the verdict, after spending last summer urging people not to support Black Lives Matter demonstrations, which he decided were \u201cin all probability going to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/jun/12/boris-johnson-we-should-not-support-black-lives-matter-protests-churchill-statue-video\">end in violence</a>\u201d. Sajid Javid, the former home secretary, tweeted, \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/sajidjavid/status/1384617003277684739\">Justice. Black lives matter</a>\u201d, seemingly forgetting that last year he said the organisation was \u201cnot a force for good\u201d and demanded protesters \u201c<a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/sajid-javid-protesters-police-chant-downing-street-a4456206.html\">show some goddamn respect</a>\u201d.</p> <p>But this is how progress is won: by not showing goddamn respect. It isn\u2019t handed over by the benign powers that govern us, but wrested from their hands through protest, riots and civil disobedience. Chauvin\u2019s conviction was not the only legal consequence of last year\u2019s mobilisations. From forcing Emmanuel Macron to put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/09/emmanuel-macron-announces-police-reform-consultation\">reform of the French police</a> on the table to catalysing <a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/06/the-philadelphia-inquirers-journalists-of-color-are-taking-a-sick-and-tired-day-after-buildings-matter-too-headline/\">change in newsrooms</a> in the US, the consequences were manifold. This type of dissent is responsible for many of the rights we all enjoy today, from universal suffrage in the UK to civil rights for black people in the US.</p> <p>But there is a broader reason why the protests were being written out of history the moment they began to have an impact. As such movements gain momentum, their reach becomes impossible to contain. The charge that Black Lives Matter is a radical movement is correct. For it to achieve its goals, for racial equity to be achieved, a wholesale rethinking of power relations \u2013 between boss and employee, border guard and migrant, ruler and ruled \u2013 must take place. A grand redistribution of wealth is essential. A fallen statue is not about a mindless moment of anger, it is a demand to fundamentally and honestly rethink a particular country\u2019s history and sense of self.</p> <p>The uncomfortable truth is that change comes about in ways that are disruptive and, yes, occasionally unsavoury. Those events are then sanitised and their significance minimised, so we can maintain a naive trust in the arc of history and those who govern us. Every legal system is as flawed and institutionally skewed as the country in which it exists. In the UK and the US, it has inbuilt biases in favour of the police and those who can afford the best legal representation. Those who cannot afford it, from marginalised communities, are subject to criminalisation, becoming forever felons in the eyes of the state.</p> <p>But the justice system is also sensitive to public opinion and the political environment, and its outcomes are often an interplay between external pressures and internal deficiencies. Accountability for George Floyd\u2019s death may have been delivered in a courtroom, but it began in the streets.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>"

Those of us who forget to bring these are handed coloured handkerchiefs and paper plates at the door of Fairfield Halls in Croydon, south London, to shake to the beat from our seats.</p> <p>The opening moments of Run It Back feature a towering set of speakers lit up with fairy lights as DJ Psykhomantus is wheeled to the centre of the traverse stage, a scaffold structure, with his mixer and decks in tow. An earthquake of a production follows, with sounds that switch from grime to jungle, soca, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/01/grime-afro-bashment-drill-how-black-british-music-became-more-fertile-than-ever\">bashment</a> and Afrobeats, sometimes within seconds, and with choreography to match.</p> <p>The volume is initially set at 10 and rockets off the chart with a bass so tremendous that it feels as if its vibrations have entered the body and settled beneath the skin. \u201cBass is the heart of it,\u201d says one performer, and speaks of how its \u201cfizzles\u201d with so much adrenaline that \u201ceven the dead have to move\u201d.

Directed by Coral Messam, it is created with Gail Babb and co-devised by Talawa Young People\u2019s Theatre. Performers include Bimpe Pacheco, George Owusu-Afriyie, Hayley Konadu, Yemurai Zvaraya, Verona Patterson, Johnson Adebayo, Montel Douglas, Azara Meghie and Mateus Daniel.

The place and value of women within this musical culture is a re-emerging theme and in this it is reminiscent of Debris Stevenson\u2019s grime musical <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/sep/26/poet-in-da-corner-review-grime-royal-court\">Poet in da Corner</a>, as well as Yasmin Joseph\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/jun/24/jouvert-review-harold-pinter-theatre-notting-hill-carnival\">J\u2019Ouvert,</a> though both these productions have a greater sense of story.

The women retaliate by performing the same misogynistic gestures on the men, rendering them absurd, and lip-syncing to Khia\u2019s My Neck, My Back (\u201cAll you ladies pop your pussy like this\u201d) to assert their sexual agency.</p> <p>The ending leaves us feeling elated and uneasy, with the N-word displayed on jackets in glittered letters. It seems less a reclamation than a symbol of unresolved conflict, and danger, as the group move silently in slow, disturbed mime. Despite the starkness of the finale, the show spills over with a visceral, rousing energy, and acts as an antidote to the quiet insularity of lockdown. \u201cMusic is freedom,\u201d a performer says, and it feels like it here.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.talawa.com/productions/run-it-back-2021\">Run It Back is at Fairfield Halls, Croydon</a>, until 18 September.</p></li> </ul>"

In addition to serving as a New York police captain, he was the Brooklyn borough president and a state senator. But he remains an unconventional, even enigmatic figure. There are questions surrounding <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/nyregion/eric-adams-residence.html\">his home address </a>and <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-local-correspondents/the-vegan-bodega-sandwiches-that-eric-adams-wants-to-see-in-the-world\">curiosity about his plant-based diet</a>, but information about his actual policies remains scarce.</p> <p>\u201cWhere Eric Adams has thrived, in many ways, is in really failing to lay out a vision,\u201d said Sochie Nnaemeka, director of the New York Working Families party. \u201cHis transition has been defined by personality, less [by] an agenda for the city.\u201d</p> <p>Progressives and advocates working across multiple sectors have voiced concerns at the slow emergence of Adams\u2019 plans and priorities, and worry about positions he has taken including increasing the use of the heavily criticized \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policy and resurrecting plainclothes police units.</p> <p>Adams\u2019 ascent comes at a crucial time in New York history, as the city seeks to emerge from the pandemic and the economic and social chaos that has come with it.</p> <p>New York\u2019s ballooning homelessness crisis, primarily caused by a lack of affordable housing, is one of the largest issues Adam must contend with. In 2020, <a href=\"https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/basic-facts-about-homelessness-new-york-city/\">more than 120,000 people</a>, including children, slept in the New York municipal shelter system, with homelessness reaching the highest levels since the Great Depression.</p> <p>Covid presented additional challenges, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/23/nyregion/homeless-shelters-covid-cases.html\">spreading rapidly among homeless populations</a>.</p> <p>Advocates have widely supported <a href=\"https://ericadams2021.com/erics-housing-plan/\">Adams\u2019 priority of increasing permanent, affordable housing</a> in a city which has some of America\u2019s most expensive rents. But many have raised concerns about Adams\u2019 main plan: converting 25,000 hotel rooms into permanent apartments, noting zoning and conversion requirements many hotels do not meet.</p> <p>Public housing, managed by the New York Public Housing Association, is another area where Adams has faced pushback. Adams <a href=\"https://www.gothamgazette.com/city/10536-democratic-mayoral-candidates-plans-rescue-nycha-public-housing\">supports privatizing public housing units</a> as well as selling air rights above public housing units. Activists have said such actions, presented as an opportunity to raise capital for blighted buildings, are ineffective and that oversight for private landlords when it comes to addressing housing issues like mold and lead paint would <a href=\"https://www.thecity.nyc/housing/2021/12/23/22852331/tenants-reach-nycha-deal-mold-monitor-rad\">become even more difficult.</a></p> <p>\u201cHis focus is going to be on his big-money donors.

In between the online schooling and Covid-test runs, the mask-sourcing and endless Zoom calls, the online grocery shopping and mapping the curve, I turned, in comfort, to my first love: poetry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/01/clementine-ford-pivots-to-love-for-how-long-can-you-be-the-provocative-feminist-voice\">Clementine Ford pivots to love: \u2018For how long can you be the provocative feminist voice?\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I wrote in fits and spurts \u2013 erratically, feverishly, snatching time whenever I had the inclination and the energy \u2013 which, granted, was not at all some days, weeks, <em>months</em>.</p> <p>From the most locked-down city in the world, I wrote in dog-eared notebooks and on the backs of old bills, penning the poems for my new collection, <a href=\"https://www.hachette.com.au/maxine-beneba-clarke/how-decent-folk-behave#:~:text=A%20vibrant%2C%20thought%2Dprovoking%20collection,Race%20and%20Carrying%20the%20World.&amp;text=On%20a%20daylight%20street%20in,under%20crushing%20weight%20of%20colony.\">How Decent Folk Behave</a>. Some were published as events unfolded, in a national paper I was freelancing for at the time. Others collected in small piles around our limited living space.</p> <p>Looking upwards from my window at the bottom of the world, I wrote about the bushfires that devoured our summers; about children marching out of school to bring attention to environmental catastrophe<em>. </em>I wrote about the epidemic of violence against women in Australia, and finding hope in the despair:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>hannah and them kids died brutal <br>we don\u2019t know \u2019em all from soap <br>but it aches my soul to muse on it <br>so babe, your mama needs to know <br>that a good man <br>exactly the man you\u2019ll be<br>will lead a bad man home.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>I wrote about the moment the Black Lives Matter movement galvanised across the world.</p> <p>When my memoir<a href=\"https://www.hachette.com.au/maxine-beneba-clarke/the-hate-race\"> The Hate Race</a><em> </em>was published in 2016, I likened writing about growing up as a Black child of migrants in Australia post-White Australia policy to \u201cwriting about a house burning down, while you\u2019re trapped inside the burning house\u201d. Mapping 2019-2021 in poetry felt similar in some ways, yet completely opposite in others. Sometimes you need to remove yourself from something in order to see it more clearly. And in this case, I was literally physically removed from the world. Instead of looking within myself for the lyrical journey, I was staring out at it.</p> <p>Art, at times of crisis, can be difficult to justify \u2013 can seem like an indulgence. I wrote about grappling with this too:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>painting gives pennies back to medicare \u2026 <br>old time jazz, that opera, eases congestion <br>in the hospitals, helps our old folks live longer in their homes <br>\u2026 poetry is why that kid so close to falling <br>through the cracks <br>even gets up <br>and goes to school \u2026 art is the heart of all that we are.</em></p> </blockquote>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What do we lose, when at crucial times in history, the artists down their tools?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019ve been asked about the emotional toll of making art which responds to such visceral events, with such immediacy. There is always an exhaustion which comes from sitting with trauma, or loss, or hopelessness. A heaviness. But what of the cost of <em>not</em> making the work? What do we lose, when at crucial times in history, the artists down their tools? There is a reason fascist regimes come for the artists. The poets weave together the threads of our stories. <em>When they come for the poets, they are coming for the truth of the people.<br><br></em>Using art to ensure the survival of story, culture and history is imbedded in many cultures. In my case, it is the Black transatlantic legacy I lean into. For centuries, those stolen, born into and descended from the transatlantic slave trade have found stunning artistic ways to express the unthinkable.</p> <p>Abducted from West Africa and trafficked through the Americas to serve as free labour for the western world, my ancestors were forbidden to speak their birth language or practise traditional customs, and forbidden to read and write English. They soon realised that a thing of beauty, of joy, of <em>poetry </em>would render certain facets of their being out of reach of their oppressors. Gospel music, for example, often contained stories of escape, or instructions and inspiration for rebellions. When plantation owners looked in on a congregation singing a rendition of Michael Row the Boat Ashore<em> </em>in mellow a capella harmonies, they probably weren\u2019t aware that Michael\u2019s boat was being rowed <em>towards freedom. </em>The lyrics of this song have even been adapted over time, to incorporate lines that mirror the Black struggle for civil rights over the centuries. Jamaican-American musician <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Qo3RmVE4Oo\">Harry Belafonte\u2019s 1962 version</a> contained the lyrics:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0bc465f598a4d0dcf821d855d8343724ac3d3cd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bc465f598a4d0dcf821d855d8343724ac3d3cd4/0_0_1524_2339/652.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of How Decent Folk Behave by Maxine Beneba Clarke\" width=\"652\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Mississippi kneel and pray, Hallelujah <br>Some more buses on the way, Hallelujah.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>In Brazil, enslaved Africans developed an art form now widely known as capoeira<em>. </em>From up at the \u201cbig house\u201d it looked like energetic dancing, but complicated combat manoeuvres were disguised within. It is this challenge I think of, when I put pen to paper, all these hundreds of years on \u2013 how to hold the reader inside the rhythm, to sing so beautifully some do not know I am singing about freedom.

     "body": "<p>A majority of people believe Black Lives Matter, the anti-racism movement that spread across the UK this summer, has increased racial tension, according to a poll.</p> <p>Just over half (55%) of UK adults believe the BLM protests that took place in big cities but also in the Shetland Islands and the Isle of Wight, increased racial tensions, according to a survey of more than 2,000 people by pollsters Opinium. Only 17% of the people polled in October disagreed. The polling also showed 44% of ethnic minorities felt BLM increased racial tensions.</p> <p>The findings, which BLM organisers said showed the movement has exposed existing fault lines, comes alongside parallel research indicating sharp rises in the number of black people saying they faced discrimination in the last year, rising from 74% in 2019 to 81%. In a possible sign of racism arising from the origin of Covid-19 in Wuhan, the proportion of Chinese people saying they faced discrimination over the same period rose from 68% to 76%, according to polling carried out in June.</p> <p>Opinium\u2019s annual survey of multicultural Britain also found that 71% of Asian people had suffered discrimination or abuse because of their ethnicity, rising to 81% among black people.</p> <p>\u201cA particularly worrying find is that the majority of BAME people have faced discrimination because of their race and ethnicity,\u201d said Mete Coban, the director of My Life My Say, a youth-led charity aimed at increasing engagement with democracy. \u201cAnother saddening finding is that 46% of BAME people have faced discrimination on multiple occasions, which is an increase from last year.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2020-11-27T11:18:15/embed.html\" data-alt=\"BLM chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2020-11-27T11:18:15/embed.html\">BLM chart</a> </figure>  <p>White people were more likely to believe that the BLM movement, which was given fresh momentum by global outrage at the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May, had increased racial tensions, Opinium found. Those citing that concern most were Conservative voters, with 78% saying they believed it had inflamed tensions and just 6% saying it hadn\u2019t.</p> <p>Race relations experts point out that senior Conservatives attacked BLM in forthright language, with the former chancellor Sajid Javid saying last month it was \u201cneo-Marxist\u201d and \u201cnot a force for good\u201d. Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, has urged schools not to support the \u201cpolitical\u201d movement in lessons.</p> <p>Asked about the survey, Adam Elliott-Cooper, a spokesman for BLM, said racial tensions in Britain long preceded the movement and that it had highlighted the issue.</p> <p>\u201cTo say that to challenge racism increases racial tension is a very misleading assumption,\u201d he said. \u201cBlack Lives Matter hasn\u2019t increased racial tension in the same way as the civil rights movement in the US didn\u2019t or the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa didn\u2019t. They haven\u2019t increased racial tension but they might have made it more apparent and exposed what is there.\u201d</p> <p>The resurgence of the BLM movement this year triggered a series of actions, which many felt were overdue, but others found controversial. These included the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/15/edward-colston-statue-replaced-by-sculpture-of-black-lives-matter-protester\">dumping of a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston</a> into Bristol\u2019s dock, and a wave of investigations into British institutions\u2019 slavery links. A 2017 book by Reni Eddo-Lodge called Why I\u2019m No Longer Talking to White People About Race, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/16/reni-eddo-lodge-first-black-british-author-top-uk-book-charts-why-i-m-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race\">shot back up the bestseller charts</a>.</p> <p>Prof Kalwant Bhopal, director of the Centre for Research in Race and Education at the University of Birmingham, said the results suggested BLM had made some white people \u201cfeel their privilege is being threatened and questioned\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they see something like BLM they do what they can to protect it and there is a backlash,\u201d she said. She added that the response of some institutions, such as universities, to pledge support for the goals of BLM, had created a \u201cmask of inclusion\u201d which obscured a reluctance to deliver real change. This was seen by some minority ethnic people as evidence of division, she said.</p>"

Graffiti, light projections, signs and memorials to black and brown lives lost to police violence transmuted the former Robert E Lee monument into a symbol of protest.</p> <p>The grassy circle where Lee once stood was informally renamed to honor Marcus David Peters, a black high school teacher fatally shot by police in 2018 during a mental health crisis. And a grieving community expressed its pain with memorials denouncing police violence, with street art, black ballerinas, small libraries and a community garden.</p> <p>On a street in an elite, white neighborhood where many black people had felt unwelcome in the presence of the statues, interracial and intergenerational gatherings and peaceful protests shifted the atmosphere \u2013 until state leaders erected a fence around the site at the beginning of 2021, says the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/auz_can/?hl=en\">Richmond muralist Austin \u201cAuz\u201d Miles</a>, who frequented the space.</p> <p>\u201cIt just became an activated space \u2026 with a community-like, homecoming feel,\u201d she says. \u201cIt felt all of a sudden like a safe space \u2026 where people were coming in and out and doing things, and displaying their art.

Their lawsuit had cited fears of diminished property values and loss of tax credits on their homes.</p> <p>But on 8 September, the Lee monument \u2013 its reimagining declared the most influential piece of protest art since the second world war by the New York Times \u2013 was the last Confederate statue on the street to come down. Several of the roadway\u2019s monuments had been removed in 2020 under emergency powers by Richmond\u2019s mayor, Levar Stoney, and angry crowds toppled a statue of Jefferson Davis, former president of the Confederate states.</p> <p>But the removal of the statues is not an ending. Now comes a new beginning and the debate on public memory and how that is expressed by a city\u2019s public art.</p> <p>The Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, one of the largest museums in the US for exhibition space, has been tapped by the state to lead work to redefine Monument Avenue, in collaboration with the city and other partners.</p> <p>Richmond residents, state and local politicians, artists, activists and historians have varying visions for Monument Avenue. Public art is widely viewed as a tool to tell a more complete and honest narrative of Richmond\u2019s struggles with equality. And how the city decides to uplift people and places with public art has the potential to be a nationwide model, or a litany of pitfalls to avoid, and it\u2019s imperative that Richmond get it right, says activist, community organizer and social worker Chelsea Higgs Wise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"881fbba1dcc914ce5756203f9185cad2c1523453\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/881fbba1dcc914ce5756203f9185cad2c1523453/0_192_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The area around the Robert E Lee statue in August 2020, at the height of racial justice protests.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The area around the Robert E Lee statue in August 2020, at the height of racial justice protests.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Tuite/ImageSpace/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA quarter of black people in the United States have roots from Richmond, Virginia, due to the domestic trade of enslaved Africans that took place here. So \u2026 what we are going through with telling our story is very much telling a national story,\u201d Higgs Wise says. \u201cAnd if we have yet to reckon with our history \u2013 and have yet to see that the removal of a large monument does not a reconciliation process make \u2013 then how are we supposed to model what it looks like for the rest of the south and the country?\u201d</p> <p>Richmond has earned failing marks on its art projects in the past. The placement of a statue of Arthur Ashe on Monument Avenue in 1996, the likeness of a black man alongside that of Confederates, was widely regarded as tone deaf. Ashe himself is deservedly revered, Richmonders say, but the design of the statue (which depicts Ashe raising a tennis racket and books above children) and its scale compared with others on the street, is questionable, adds Higgs Wise.</p> <p>\u201cUpon first look, unfortunately you\u2019re unsure if he\u2019s raising his tennis racket to be excited or if he\u2019s going to bring it down on the children that are below him,\u201d she says.</p> <p>City government can often be slow to act on initiatives proposed by artists and embracing new art traditions, says <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sillygenius/?hl=en\">Taron Sparks, a Richmond muralist known as \u201cSilly Genius\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of older people on [the public art commission] \u2026 and they\u2019re mostly coming from the fine art world,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s this extra layer of red tape with doing projects in the city.\u201d</p> <p>But Richmond has done better recently. This week the Dr Martin Luther King Memorial Commission unveiled the Emancipation and Freedom Monument in a popular James River park, a short stroll from the American Civil War Museum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b14bee8dc8f6de298cc7e22fe21925f17a8462ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b14bee8dc8f6de298cc7e22fe21925f17a8462ae/0_79_2820_1693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children play near the Emancipation and Freedom Monument, designed by Thomas Jay Warren, on the day it was unveiled in Richmond, Virginia, on 22 September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children play near the Emancipation and Freedom Monument, designed by Thomas Jay Warren, on the day it was unveiled in Richmond, Virginia, on 22 September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jay Paul/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 12ft work depicts a man and woman recently freed from bondage, and honors notable black Virginians on its base.

Artists and architects should \u201csee themselves as resources, facilitators and collaborators\u201d, instead of imposing their visions on communities, <a href=\"https://www.pps.org/article/collaborative-creative-placemaking-good-public-art-depends-on-good-public-spaces\">wrote the national urban planning experts Cynthia Nikitin and Fred Kent.</a></p> <p>They added that widely used public art spaces often emphasize \u201cflexibility, changeability [and] evolution\u201d, seemingly speaking to the organic acts of reclamation that sprang up around the Lee monument. Poor examples of public art are \u201cstatic sculpture gardens\u201d as opposed to \u201cmulti-use public destinations\u201d, they continued.</p> <p>The VMFA has been praised as an obvious choice to lead artistic efforts on Monument Avenue, and the institution has stressed that it will involve community leaders, city residents, urban planners, historians and archivists.</p> <p>The VMFA also has the credibility of celebrating black legacy with artist <a href=\"https://www.vmfa.museum/about/rumors-of-war/\">Kenhinde Wiley\u2019s Rumors of War</a> and its exhibitions. Though Northam had asked for more than $10m to be granted to the VMFA for planning and initial construction on Monument Avenue, lawmakers reduced the amount to $1m over two years, and say they will return to the discussion when the museum presents a plan next September.</p> <p>But Allan-Charles Chipman, who ran for Richmond city council in 2020, and others say they fear that as a large institution, the VMFA won\u2019t be able to evoke the communal, multi-use and grassroots energy on Monument Avenue in 2020. And the museum should keep in mind that the graffiti on the plinths and other pieces were legitimate art, Chipman adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7173f39d7b24b5341f1c893b22c2cfba460b89ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7173f39d7b24b5341f1c893b22c2cfba460b89ca/0_72_2850_1710/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The image of the late congressman John Lewis is projected on the statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee in Richmond, Virginia, in July 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The image of the late congressman John Lewis is projected on the statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee in Richmond, Virginia, in July 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jay Paul/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI do not want to erase the reimagining that\u2019s already happened, because this would be a different conversation if the monuments and pedestals were clearly blank slates,\u201d he says. \u201cI would like to see the powers that be get behind, [and] really lead, support and amplify the art and the expressions that have already taken place there.\u201d</p> <p>The powers that be have already gotten it wrong, says Princess Blanding, the sister of Marcus David Peters, who is running for governor as an independent. Blanding criticizes the Library of Virginia for collecting and temporarily storing the items people left around the monument, just before the statue came down. The library is awaiting instructions from the Virginia department of general services on next steps.</p> <p>While the institution has been praised for protecting the works, Blanding and others say that the community should have been consulted on the future of these memorials to black lives, and have concerns about how they will be kept and honored.</p> <p>\u201cWhile people were celebrating and prepping for this big hurrah, for this symbolic gesture [the Lee removal], they literally had people there collecting these memorials,\u201d Blanding says. \u201cIt hurts on a deep level because even though it was named for my brother, that was a space for grieving families.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0198185de8bfa1f988f245534e251e8269091112\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0198185de8bfa1f988f245534e251e8269091112/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert E Lee Statue, Richmond, USA - 30 Aug 2020Mandatory Credit: Photo by Chris Tuite/ImageSPACE/REX/Shutterstock (10760454as) General View of the Robert E Lee Statue and surrounding area on August 30, 2020 in Richmond, Virginia.

Briefly, there is a battle between Usain Bolt the diplomat and Usain Bolt the competitor. The competitor wins. \u201cMe and a friend were talking about this the other day,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018should I be upset?\u2019 Because I know over the years everyone has tried to make spikes different and better but \u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>Bolt stresses he is not worried about the current crop shredding his 100m world record of 9.58sec or his 200m best of 19.19sec. Yet he sounds uneasy about where the arms race in shoe technology will lead. \u201cHow can I argue if World Athletics decide that it\u2019s legal? I can\u2019t do anything about it. The rules are the rules. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be fully happy, but it\u2019s just one of those things.\u201d</p> \n<p>He wants to make one thing absolutely clear: he would have gone a whole lot faster in the new wave of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/feb/22/super-spikes-seismic-shift-athletics-track-nike-air-zoom-victory-tokyo-olympics\" title=\"\">super spikes</a> \u2013 which feature a superlight, energy-returning foam and are said to be worth at least a tenth of a second over 100m. He is just not sure by how much. \u201cWe have guessed and we have talked about it, but I don\u2019t know for sure,\u201d he says. \u201cBut definitely much faster. Below 9.5 seconds for sure.

If a track athlete decides to do it, they should be able to voice their opinion.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is rare for Bolt to grant an exclusive interview with a British newspaper and rarer still to hear him so reflective on so many subjects, including fame and falling short. Such sentiments are not usually associated with someone who won 134 of his 146 races between 2008 and 2017, winning eight Olympic gold medals and 11 world titles along the way. But when Bolt looks back at his career he believes he was capable of winning 200m gold at the 2004 Athens Olympics, when he was 17.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"93980f61dcafeaf2bcc1151a39f7fd72fad3eaf4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93980f61dcafeaf2bcc1151a39f7fd72fad3eaf4/0_130_5906_3545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Usain Bolt in 800m training: \u2018I have no regrets.

He believes people forget that, as a 16-year-old, he ran 20.13sec to finish 2003 ranked ninth in the world. But after moving to Kingston, and discovering Burger King and nightclubs, he did not always want to train. That, and a subsequent injury, meant he didn\u2019t emerge out of the heats in Athens.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn 2003 I was running faster than almost everybody,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I had run in the world championships that year I would have probably medalled. And if I\u2019d continued on that road, I would have run 19 seconds earlier in my career, so for sure I could have won gold in Athens if I\u2019d dedicated myself more.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cBut it was tough for me because even in high school I was famous. Everyone knew who I was in Jamaica. And I didn\u2019t have somebody who had already been through it to say: \u2018You have to take this seriously, because this is what you could do.\u2019 It was just my coach telling me to train hard.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I try to talk to the younger athletes now and explain to them \u2018get serious early man\u2019. Because the possibilities are endless.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The women\u2019s finals will be without a doubt more interesting.

But he was like, \u2018It\u2019s going to be harder than before \u2013 coming back is not going to be a cakewalk.\u2019 </p> \n<p>\u201cWhen I look back I have no regrets. I did extremely well in my career. True, it didn\u2019t end on the greatest note but the legacy I left is wonderful.\u201d</p> \n<p>For years Bolt has been asked whether he will run again. Until now the answer has always been no. But on 13 July he will return to the track over 800m, a distance he has never run professionally, in a promotion for the US firm CarMax. The challenge, which will be streamed live on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/usainbolt\" title=\"\">Bolt\u2019s Facebook page</a>, is lighthearted \u2013 can he do two laps of his home track in Kingston quicker than a CarMax customer receives a live <a href=\"https://www.carmax.com/usainly-fast-offers\">online appraisal offer</a>, a process that typically takes under two minutes? \u2013 but he says he is taking it seriously.</p> \n<p>\u201cI train every day of the week. I still do a lot of cardio. And I\u2019m on my Peleton too. Now I just need to sharpen up at the track and get my lung capacity up.\u201d</p> \n<p>You do look in shape, I say. He laughs. \u201cI have tried to stay fit because my friends told me that when I retired I would get fat and I was like \u2018no way\u2019. So I can\u2019t let myself go when they have bet me it will happen in the next six to eight years. For me, it\u2019s a pride thing. I\u2019m not going to let them win. I\u2019m not going to give them the satisfaction.\u201d</p> \n<p>So how fast could he run 800m? \u201cMy personal best is around 2:05, but when I put my spikes on I reckon I can take five seconds off.\u201d</p> \n<p>Given he is only 34, could he yet be tempted to race properly again? \u201cNo, no, definitely not. This is just a challenge. Even now, I need something to challenge myself.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da7992f807280616ebad1d1ecbc50d9dd4b9714a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da7992f807280616ebad1d1ecbc50d9dd4b9714a/0_458_1239_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Usain Bolt and Kasi Bennett\" width=\"1000\" height=\"872\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Usain Bolt and his partner Kasi Bennett after announcing the birth of their twins, Saint Leo Bolt and Thunder Bolt.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For the past three Olympics, Bolt has been the closest thing sport has had to a religious experience. Even the mere mention of his name would create a wall of sound at the stadiums in Beijing, London and Rio, while his familiar burst of unanswerable speed and joy somehow always seemed to make jaws drop and smile at the same time. Bolt acknowledges that Tokyo will be a very different and difficult experience for athletes trapped in the bubble, as well as the few spectators permitted. But he believes a combination of a fast track and hot conditions will lead to spectacular performances.</p> \n<p>Unsurprisingly, it is the 100m and 200m that excites him the most, but his answer comes with a twist. \u201cThe women\u2019s finals will be without a doubt more interesting,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m looking forward to the most. The women have really stepped up and they\u2019ve led the way for a few years now.\u201d</p> \n<p>He talks about the protagonists with a coach\u2019s eye, noting how the Jamaican favourite Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce has changed her stride pattern to make herself faster and how Britain\u2019s Dina Asher-Smith looks far stronger than when she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/02/dina-asher-smith-wins-world-200m-golg-world-athletics-championships\" title=\"\">won 200m gold</a> at the 2019 world championships.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/jun/30/gabby-thomas-offers-latest-hint-womens-sprint-records-may-finally-fall\">Gabby Thomas offers latest hint women\u2019s sprint records may finally fall | Andy Bull</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cDina has already proven herself to be one of top athletes in the world,\u201d Bolt says. \u201cBut she keeps pushing to be the best and to beat the best. You see she puts in the work. She has the dedication. If a conversation is happening about who is going to win Olympic gold, she\u2019s a part of it.\u201d</p> \n<p>But when asked who he would put his money on for the 100m, he opts for his compatriot. \u201cShelly\u2011Ann has the edge because of her experience, as long as she just doesn\u2019t put too much pressure on herself. But Dina is her closest challenger.\u201d</p> \n<p>Before Covid struck, Bolt had intended to go to Tokyo as a fan, watching as many sports as possible \u2013 with fencing particularly on his bucket list. Instead, he will be in Kingston, watching while playing with his three children, Olympia Lightning Bolt, who turned one in May, and two-month-old twins Thunder Bolt and Saint Leo Bolt. He would love them to go into sports but says that a fourth child, which could create an unbeatable mixed 4x400m relay team, is not going to happen.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you\u2019re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>When asked what parenthood has taught him most, Bolt instantly replies \u201cpatience\u201d.

For the good of the country, now is the time to step aside.\u201d</p> <p>While serving as majority leader, McConnell blocked Barack Obama from filling a vacancy left by the death of the conservative justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016, contending that it would be inappropriate to confirm a supreme court nominee during a presidential election year.</p> <p>McConnell and his fellow Senate Republicans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/mar/20/republicans-opposition-supreme-court-nominee-merrick-garland\">refused to consider</a> Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland, who now serves as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/21/merrick-garland-attorney-general-justice-department-confirmation\">Biden\u2019s attorney general</a>. That enabled Donald Trump, the winner of the November 2016 election, to appoint the conservative justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017.</p> <p>Democrats accused McConnell of hypocrisy last year when he allowed the Senate to confirm Trump\u2019s conservative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/26/amy-coney-barrett-confirmed-supreme-court-justice-vote\">nominee Amy Coney Barrett</a> to replace the liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/18/ruth-bader-ginsburg-supreme-court-justice-dies-aged-87\">died in September</a>, about six weeks before the 2020 presidential election.</p> <p>Christopher Kang, co-founder and chief counsel of Demand Justice, told the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2021/may/28/should-joe-biden-reform-the-supreme-court-politics-weekly-extra-podcast\">Politics Weekly Extra podcast:</a> \u201cI think certainly that looking back, and even at the time, a lot of people <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/25/us/politics/rbg-retirement-obama.html\">thought</a> that the prudent thing for Justice Ginsburg to do to ensure her legacy would have been to retire.</p> <p>\u201cI think this is the same conversation that a lot of progressives are having right now with respect to Justice Breyer, who is one of those three Democratic-appointed justices on the supreme court. He\u2019s 82 years old. He could retire and we believe he should retire now and make way for the first Black woman to serve on the supreme court.</p> <p>Kang, who served in the Obama White House, added: \u201cBut it\u2019s challenging because supreme court justices are nominated right now for life and the decision when to retire is completely up to them.</p> <p>\u201cI was not part of the decision-making process at the time with respect to whether or not to reach out to Justice Ginsburg. I understand that the White House chose at the time not to do that but I think certainly looking at the impact of what happened, we could be in a very different place.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>Activists from Black Lives Matter\u2019s UK affiliate have said they were not behind an attempt to register the name as a new UK political party.</p> <p>A notice of the application to register a UK-wide political party under the name Black Lives Matter was published by the Electoral Commission on Monday. </p> <p>Sources from Black Lives Matter\u2019s UK affiliate \u2013 now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/23/blm-uk-gains-legal-status-with-renaming-as-black-liberation-movement-uk\">officially registered</a> as a community benefit society under the name Black Liberation Movement UK \u2013 denied involvement. Speaking on behalf of the group, Lemara Francis said: \u201cBLM is proud to be a political organisation, but has no plans to set up a political party.</p> <p>\u201cBLM UK launched in 2016. We have been doing grassroots community work and direct action across the UK for the last four years. We are part of the global BLM network working to end racism and anti-black violence.</p> <p>\u201cThis year, the surge in support for Black Lives Matter has seen a range of new individuals and groups acting under the BLM banner. Not all of them share the goals of the wider BLM movement.\u201d</p> <p>There was further confusion after several rightwing newspapers quoted denials from activists organising under the name Black Lives Matter who were not from the movement\u2019s officially recognised UK affiliate. </p> <p>The Guardian has also contacted a number of other groups organising under the name to ask if they were behind the registration.</p> <p>According to the Electoral Commission\u2019s notice of application, as well as using the Black Lives Matter name, various proposed descriptions for the party include: Black Lives Matter/All Lives Matter; Black Lives Matter for the GLA; Black Lives Matter Great Britain; Black Lives Matter (United Kingdom); The Black Lives Matterparty; Black Lives Matter party of Wales; Black Lives Matter party of Scotland.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the commission said that an application to register a political party could not be made without providing details of a financial scheme to fund it, a constitution setting out its organisation and structure, details of who would fill the roles of party leader, treasurer, nominating officer, and at least two other officials, and a non-refundable \u00a3150 application submission fee.</p> <p>Black Lives Matter first emerged in the US in 2013 as a response to police and vigilante <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/george-zimmerman-trial-trayvon-martin\">killings of black men</a> and youths. Various groups have been organising in the UK under the slogan since around 2016, but there is only one recognised affiliate of the US movement in the country.</p> <p>In September, that group officially registered as a community benefit society under the name Black Liberation Movement UK \u2013 with the legal status a condition of its receiving \u00a31.2m in donations that had been donated to the cause via a GoFundMe appeal. The name change was partly down to a number of companies having already registered under the various permutations of the slogan.</p> <p>Last week BLM UK activists said that despite the change of name they would continue to organise under the Black Lives Matter slogan. <br></p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Police brutality in Nigeria has sparked huge national protests. There should be international outrage too<br></p>",
     "body": "<p>Last Sunday, wearing a face shield, a protective mask and a waist-pouch full of hand sanitiser, I stood in front of the Nigerian high commission in London with hundreds of fellow Nigerians. We held up placards, raised our fists and chanted: \u201cEnd Sars,\u201d over and over again.</p> \n<p>The cry had first begun in Nigeria, when a video emerged of special anti-robbery squad (Sars) police officers shooting a man on the streets of Lagos. Though the date of the video is unknown, as is the name of the victim, Nigerians are no strangers to police brutality. It has either happened to you, or to someone you know. The police are not<em> </em>your friends, we often joke, with our special blend of black humour.</p> \n<p>And yet somehow, something was different this time. Musicians like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iRuntown/status/1312740945612484615\">Runtown</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/falzthebahdguy?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Falz</a> tweeted about a protest. The next day, the streets were full of young people chanting \u201cEnd Sars\u201d. Almost everyone had a story about being assaulted by a Sars officer, of being extorted, sexually harassed, or wrongfully detained.</p> \n<p>Soon, US celebrities such as P Diddy, Trey Songz and Viola Davis had picked up the hashtag and were tweeting their support. In the UK, actor John Boyega, who is of Nigerian descent, also used his social media page to support the protests. What these stars realised, before most of the western media did, was that this was another iteration of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> \n<p>Nigerian police officers are black, you may say. How can this be a BLM issue? Well, imagine New Zealand police officers shooting, maiming and killing unarmed white citizens because they were well dressed, because they had flashy phones, because they worked in the tech industry and therefore assumed they must be involved in fraud (all reasons used by Sars). Imagine if there were video footage of all these atrocities happening in leafy Christchurch. There would be global outrage. International sanctions. World leaders rushing to condemn these acts.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"876d904a-766b-4590-b9bd-a5f9f79d5ffd\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0MwlFIPy0OI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet the world seems curiously indifferent when the victims are black. Part of the reason African leaders get away with atrocities on African soil is because they know the world will turn a blind eye to them. Murderous despots will still be granted visas to Paris, London and New York. They will spend their loot on property and gaudy Rolexes, propping up foreign economies instead of building their own.</p> \n<p>The Black Lives Matter movement began because the deaths of innocent African American men and women were ignored, in the same way the deaths of young Nigerians at the hands of Sars have been ignored.</p> \n<p>Black lives matter everywhere that black lives are found: be it on the streets of the US, in rubber dinghies on the Mediterranean Sea, or in the towns and cities of Nigeria. Nigerians cried over the killing of George Floyd. And we hope in America, in Brazil, in Britain, in France, in China, in India, the African diaspora will also stand with us as we mourn the protester <a href=\"https://www.channelstv.com/2020/10/10/endsars-protester-jimoh-isiaq-killed-in-ogbomosho-seven-others-injured/\">Jimoh Isiaq</a>, who was shot last Saturday, and others killed by Sars.</p> \n<p>When one of us hurts, we all hurt. When one of us wins, we all win. This was the Pan-African dream of Marcus Garvey, of WEB Du Bois, of Constance Agatha Cummings-John, of Edward Wilmot Blyden, of Abdias do Nascimento, of Kwame Nkrumah and of many others.</p> \n<p>The protests continue daily in Nigeria. There will also be <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CGX4FvfB5Y5/\">one in London</a> on Sunday. The government has promised to dissolve the Sars unit and replace it with a Swat team, but many people feel it\u2019s just renaming rather than resolving the problem. The mistrust is warranted. The Nigerian government has promised to disband Sars before. Protesters continue to ask for tangible steps, such as the release of all detained protesters and the setting up of an independent body to investigate police misconduct.</p> \n<p>Already, heroes have emerged. The Feminist Coalition has raised millions of naira for protesters\u2019 legal and health bills. The podcaster FK Abudu and a host of Nigerian lawyers, such as Moe Odele and Tola Onayemi, are coordinating the release of protesters who have been wrongfully detained. Young Nigerians have marched in the sun and in the rain, and have done so peacefully, picking up their litter at the end of each day.</p> \n<p>Yet there are no leaders in the #EndSARS movement: as protesters reiterate, this is an organic, spontaneous eruption of the will of a young Nigerian population. No one knows what the movement will lead to. Some say it is a Nigerian version of the Arab spring. I say, we don\u2019t want a spring. Spring is a brief season that passes away. We want a new Nigeria that will last for generations.</p> \n<p>What can people in the rest of the world do? If you engage with Nigerian culture, if you dance to Afrobeats stars like Wizkid and Burna Boy, if you eat jollof rice and watch Nollywood movies on Netflix, then please show your support for #EndSARS. Black lives matter everywhere that black lives are found.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Chibundu Onuzo is author of The Spider King\u2019s Daughter and Welcome to Lagos</p>"

Experts point to several possible explanations, including bias from judges and other officials, and young people of color being detained for more serious offenses and having fewer resources and alternatives to incarceration in their communities.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fitting that in 2020, the year that juxtaposed Covid and racial justice protests, we saw this shrinking of the system \u2013 but also a resistance to doing so for young Black people,\u201d said Patricia Soung, a juvenile attorney and former director of youth justice policy for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund in California.</p> \n  <p><strong>By May 2020, detention centers were releasing white youths at a 17% higher rate than Black youths</strong>, according to a monthly <a href=\"https://www.aecf.org/blog/survey-amid-pandemic-youth-detention-population-fell-24-in-one-month-matchi/\">survey of juvenile justice agencies</a> in more than 30 states conducted by the Annie E Casey Foundation.</p> \n  <p>And in the months since, while the number of white youths has remained historically low, the number of Black and Latino youths has risen slightly, said Tom Woods, a senior associate and juvenile justice data analyst for the Casey Foundation.</p> \n  <p>The racial gap in detention is worsening even though teens, including those of color, were arrested less often in 2020, data shows. Police have generally taken a more hands-off approach due to the virus and, because classes have gone virtual, young people have interacted less with school-based officers.</p> \n  <p><strong>Read more of Eli Hager\u2019s report here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/08/us-juvenile-detention-race-marshall-project\">Racial inequality in US youth detention wider than ever, experts say</a></strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/08/us-juvenile-detention-race-marshall-project\">Racial inequality in US youth detention wider than ever, experts say</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60460ca48f08168521f5f61e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-08T11:39:14.433Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A quick foreign snap here from Reuters. <strong>The US mission in Saudi Arabia has condemned drone and missile attacks launched by Yemen\u2019s Houthi movement</strong> on Saudi Arabia on Sunday, including at a facility vital to petroleum exports.</p> \n  <p>The mission, in an Arabic-language post on Twitter on Monday, said \u201cthe heinous Houthi assaults on civilians and vital infrastructure\u201d demonstrated lack of respect for human life and disregard for peace efforts.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/USAinKSA/status/1368880406511165440\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">\u062a\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u062c\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0648\u062b\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0629. \u062a\u064f\u0638\u0647\u0631 \u0627\u0639\u062a\u062f\u0627\u0621\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0648\u062b\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0646\u064a\u0639\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0646\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u062a\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u062d\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0647\u0645 \u0644\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0639\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0647\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645\u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u064a \u0644\u062a\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645. <a href=\"https://t.co/fMSMAAgJ84\">pic.twitter.com/fMSMAAgJ84</a></p>\u2014 U.S. Mission to KSA (@USAinKSA) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USAinKSA/status/1368880406511165440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 8, 2021</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60460a8e8f08a73fb523806d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-08T11:37:33.402Z\">11.37am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Jury selection for Derek Chauvin trial over death of George Floyd expected to last three weeks</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The process of the trial for the killing of George Floyd will start with jury selection</strong>. It could be a lengthy process, writes Amy Forliti of the Associated Press. Twelve Hennepin County residents will be picked after an extensive grilling about their views on police and the justice system.</p> \n  <p><strong>Derek Chauvin</strong> is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd\u2019s death. <strong>Picking a jury is expected to take at least three weeks</strong>, as prosecutors and defense attorneys try to weed out people who may be biased against them.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want jurors who are completely blank slates, because that would mean they\u2019re not in tune at all with the world,\u201d Susan Gaertner, a former prosecutor, said. \u201cBut what you want is jurors who can set aside opinions that have formed prior to walking into the courtroom and give both sides a fair hearing.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Floyd was killed last year after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck for about nine minutes. His death sparked Black Lives Matter protests in Minneapolis and beyond, and led to a nationwide reckoning on race. Chauvin and three other officers were fired; the others face an August trial on aiding and abetting charges.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a97556f27367ab3168e6781fb95f63cbd0184fac\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a97556f27367ab3168e6781fb95f63cbd0184fac/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The George Floyd Memorial is seen in September last year, outside of Cup Foods located at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The George Floyd Memorial is seen in September last year, outside of Cup Foods located at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amy Harris/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Chauvin\u2019s attorney, Eric Nelson, argued that pretrial publicity of the case and the subsequent violent unrest in Minneapolis would make it impossible to find an impartial jury in Hennepin County. But Judge Peter Cahill said last year that moving the trial probably wouldn\u2019t cure the problem of a potentially tainted jury pool because \u201cno corner of the State of Minnesota\u201d has been shielded from pretrial publicity.<br></p> \n  <p>The potential jurors were sent questionnaires to determine how much they have heard about the case and whether they\u2019ve formed any opinions. Besides biographical and demographic information, jurors were asked about prior contacts with police, whether they have protested against police brutality and whether they believe the justice system is fair. Some of the questions get very specific, such as how often a potential juror has watched the bystander video of Floyd\u2019s arrest, or whether they carried a sign at a protest and what that sign said.</p> \n  <p>Unlike typical jury selection proceedings, this jury pool will be questioned one by one instead of in a group. The judge, defense attorney and prosecutors will all get to ask questions. The defense can object to up to 15 potential jurors without giving a reason; prosecutors can block up to nine with no reason given. Both sides can also argue to dismiss an unlimited number of jurors \u201cfor cause,\u201d meaning they must provide a reason why they believe that juror shouldn\u2019t serve. </p> \n  <p>Even if a juror says they have had a negative interaction with the police, or a negative opinion about Black Lives Matter, the key will be trying to find out whether they can put those past experiences or opinions aside and be fair.</p> \n  <p>Opening arguments are not expected until 29 March at the earliest.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-604606748f08a73fb5238041\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-08T11:16:30.124Z\">11.16am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Darryl Fears and Jared Goyette are covering the developments in the trial of Derek Chauvin for the Washington Post, and here\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/a-silent-march-and-symbolic-coffin-on-the-eve-of-the-trial-for-george-floyds-death/2021/03/07/8331b4aa-7f66-11eb-9ca6-54e187ee4939_story.html\">how they reported</a> yesterday\u2019s silent protest in Minneapolis.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A Sunday afternoon march drew a few thousand people to the Hennepin County Government Center, which these days is encircled by concrete barriers and multiple layers of security fencing.

Under his leadership, the Spurs organization became the league standard for professionalism, respectability and doing things the \u201cright way\u201d, a reputation that rubbed off on San Antonio greats like David Robinson, Manu Ginobli, Kawhi Leonard, Tony Parker, Avery Johnson, Sean Elliott, LaMarcus Aldridge, Patty Mills, DeMar DeRozan, Rudy Gay and countless others.</p> <p>But what makes Coach Popovich really special, as well as unique, is the way he used his voice and his platform to speak out on injustice, racism, police brutality and the rest of societal ills that plague American society, not only on a daily, personal basis, but a systemic basis. As a white man, in the state of Texas of all places, this not only requires a lot of courage but commands a lot of respect.</p> <p>Pop had a knack for utilizing NBA press conferences and post-game interviews to express his thoughts and opinions on various topics, often without prompting or provocation. </p> <p>After George Floyd was murdered, Coach Popovich\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/06/gregg-popovich-nba-san-antonio-spurs-racism-george-floyd?src=rss\">heartfelt address</a> said what a lot of people needed to hear.</p> <p>\u201cIn a strange, counterintuitive sort of way, the best teaching moment of this recent tragedy, I think, was the look on the officer\u2019s face, [during Floyd\u2019s death]. For white people to see how nonchalant, how casual, just how everyday-going-about-his job, so much so that he could just put his left hand in his pocket, wriggle his knee around a little bit to teach this person some sort of a lesson \u2013 and that it was his right and his duty to do it, in his mind.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019m just embarrassed as a white person to know that that can happen. To actually watch a lynching. We\u2019ve all seen books, and you look in the books and you see black people hanging off of trees. And you...are amazed. But we just saw it again. I never thought I\u2019d see that, with my own eyes, in real-time.\u201d</p> <p>In 2017, Popovich spoke at length at Spurs media day about systemic racism and politics, saying the country under <a href=\"https://www.ksat.com/news/2017/09/25/watch-popovich-blasts-president-trump-says-our-country-is-embarrassment-to-world/\">Trump had become \u201can embarrassment to the world</a>\u201d: \u201cObviously, race is the elephant in the room and we all understand that. Unless it is talked about constantly, it\u2019s not going to get better. Why do we have to talk about that?\u2019 Well, because it\u2019s uncomfortable. There has to be an uncomfortable element in the discourse for anything to change.</p> <p>\u201cThe disgusting tenure and tone and all the comments \u2026 have been xenophobic, homophobic, racist, misogynistic. I live in a country where half the people ignored that to elect someone.\u201d</p> <p>Asked to <a href=\"https://www.ksat.com/sports/2020/01/20/popovich-reflects-on-legacy-of-mlk-fears-roll-back-of-race-situation-in-country/\">reflect on the life of Dr Martin Luther King Jr</a> and race relations in the country, part of Popovich\u2019s answer focused on the country\u2019s leadership.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems like a lot of roll back in that regard, especially as we look at the race situation in our country. Everybody wants to forget about it but it should be there, front and center, constantly,\u201d Popovich said.</p> <p>\u201cRace is still the unanswered dilemma that everyone continues to ignore. Dr. King did not ignore it, and it\u2019s a big fear now that we have a group in power that is very willing to ignore it. It\u2019s not just with their words, but their actions prove it, and that is scary.\u201d</p> <p>Now. Coach Popovich wasn\u2019t the first and definitely won\u2019t be the last in sports to verbally spank the former US president or call out the blatant and the prevailing racism and bigotry that is currently running rampant not only throughout the Republican Party but America as a whole, yet he\u2019s certainly one of the most important and unique for a number of reasons:</p> <p><strong>1)</strong> Coach Popovich is a graduate of the Air Force Academy and works in a military town.</p> <p><strong>2)</strong> The aforementioned standard that he and the Spurs organization has set would appear to be in direct opposition to his public chastisement of the America.</p> <p><strong>3)</strong> Coach Popovich was making these statements in the ultra-red state of Texas, arguably the most conservative of the conservative states based on the state legislature and the congressional delegation, one that has voted Republican in 10 straight presidential elections and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/mapdata-2016/2016-election/results/map/president/\">saw 52.6% of voters punch for Trump</a>.</p> <p>For my book <a href=\"http://www.akashicbooks.com/catalog/police-brutality-and-white-supremacy-the-fight-against-american-traditions/\">Police Brutality and White Supremacy: The Fight Against American Traditions</a>, I interviewed former NBA player Rex Chapman, who is white. He spoke to the power of white people in particular speaking out on injustice.</p> <p>\u201cA big part of it makes me sad that we have to have white people speaking out in order for it to resonate with a lot of white America,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cIt hurts my heart when I see my friends Steve Kerr, Steve Nash, Stan Van Gundy, Greg Popovich picking their spots, because they\u2019re still in the NBA. I know the tightrope they do have to walk on some issues, but some of the stuff they\u2019ve said Black people have been saying for decades. I\u2019m proud of them for saying it now Proud to call them my friends. I\u2019m proud to be of the group of white people who genuinely want to be allies in this fight.\u201d</p> <p>The reality is, there are segments of people in America who will give one big collective eye roll to hearing any Black person talk about systemic racism, police brutality, white supremacy, and bigotry. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s LeBron James, Colin Kaepernick, Barack Obama or anyone else. But they will hear it from someone like Coach Popovich. They will think about it. Reflect on it. And not be immediately offended or dismiss that he is \u2018playing the race card\u2019.</p> <p>Coach Popovich said that it\u2019s up to white people to call out racism no matter what the consequences and didn\u2019t even really receive any backlash for his comments, not even in an ultra-conservative place like Texas. And that\u2019s what makes him unique and special. Yes, Popovich\u2019s coaching milestone is historic and worthy of celebration, but his activism off the court will endure longer as the standard for all white people who truly want to be allies in this fight against racism and white supremacy.</p>"

     "body": "<p>On Monday 2 March 1981, Leila Hassan Howe led a 20,000-person march through the streets of London. It was designed, she said, to \u201ccause maximum disruption\u201d and so, for eight hours, on a working day, the protesters marched; when they stopped the traffic on Blackfriars Bridge the police were so angry they tried to end it there. When they continued down Fleet Street \u2013 then synonymous with the British media \u2013 Hassan Howe says that \u201cpeople were throwing banana skins at us\u201d. Yet neither the police nor overt racism in the home of the press could stop them.</p> <p>The protest that Hassan Howe helped organise \u2013 with her partner, the journalist, activist and publisher Darcus Howe \u2013 was dubbed the National Black People\u2019s Day of Action. And it was unlike anything seen in Britain before. Today it is considered to be a turning point in black British identity.</p> <p>The poet Linton Kwesi Johnson would later talk of the \u201csense of power\u201d and optimism the march gave him, while for the playwright Kwame Kwei-Armah watching the event on TV \u201cwas my first experience of us, as a black community, standing up \u2026 This was black Britain.\u201d The publisher <a href=\"https://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/article/gallery/test-diane-julie-abbott-politician/\">Eric Huntley</a>, who, with his late wife Jessica, founded the publishers Bogle-L\u2019Ouverture, was so moved he told Hassan Howe he had previously \u201calways intended to go back to Guyana. But after the day of action, that was over.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bea2975f2e79100ab52b87031de9dad3f14eff4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bea2975f2e79100ab52b87031de9dad3f14eff4/0_0_4295_2847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The National Black People\u2019s Day of Action near Hyde Park on 2 March 1981.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The National Black People\u2019s Day of Action near Hyde Park on 2 March 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hassan Howe had helped arrange the march in response to the deaths of 13 young black people who had been trapped in a house fire in New Cross, south-east London, six weeks earlier. The blaze started during a birthday party for the 16-year-old Yvonne Ruddock, and she was among those who died that night.<strong> </strong>Many people suspected that the fire was the result of a racist arson attack; the area was notorious for far-right violence (<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/new-cross-fire-black-peoples-day-of-action_uk_5e582608c5b6450a30bc0ac3\">three years earlier</a> the local Moonshot club had been firebombed, and the National Front was implicated). But rather than seriously investigating the suspicion of racist violence, the police were said to be rounding up young black people and trying to get them to confess. Meanwhile the media and government were silent. \u201cThirteen dead, nothing said\u201d was the chant shouted by protesters highlighting this indifference to the loss of black lives. The march, then, was a response to the urgent need to take a stand and transform a Britain in which, for years, the black community had felt under attack.</p> <p>Hassan Howe says she realised how pivotal the moment could be at the very first meeting called at the Moonshot to discuss the response to the fire. She expected 50 people to turn up; more than 300 arrived. \u201cThere was a lot of anger, people saying \u2018enough is enough\u2019,\u201d she recalls. In 1981 there was \u201ca political consciousness, a militancy in the community and we had to take a stand\u201d. Looking back it is no surprise that, just a month later, a full-scale revolt took place in Brixton, south London, in the form of the 1981 uprisings.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In preparation for the journey, her father said: 'Everything you\u2019ve been taught about Africa and Africans isn\u2019t true'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Black power, a global grassroots movement to restore pride in being black, had begun to mobilise for change. In the UK this translated into a \u201cself-help\u201d movement for black communities, aiming to bring them together to challenge racism and its impact, while demanding justice from the state. Black power organisations such as the Black Parents Movement, Black Youth Movement and Race Today Collective spent months holding meetings and travelling around the country before the national demonstration. \u201cBlack British identity was forged in black power,\u201d says Hassan Howe.</p> <p>She was born in London in 1948 to a working-class English mother and a father from Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania) who worked as a halal butcher; her parents met before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/16/windrush-scandal-the-long-betrayal-archived-documents-david-olusoga\">Empire Windrush</a> even docked. Most of her mother\u2019s family had never met a black person before, and on hearing the news that she was dating Ramadhan Hassan, Hassan Howe\u2019s aunt asked her mother, Lilian Ivy Watson: \u201cOh Lily, what have you gone and done?\u201d He had come to Britain as a seaman and had strong ties to the east African community. Although her mother didn\u2019t like it, their home was a \u201chaven for anyone from east Africa\u201d arriving in London and people would turn up \u201cany time of day or night\u201d, says Hassan Howe.</p> <p>Ramadhan Hassan was a devout Muslim who ensured his daughter was brought up in the faith. When she was 10, her parents divorced and her father was granted custody. He decided to take his daughter to live in Zanzibar, partly to educate her about the continent. Hassan Howe was initially devastated about moving to Africa and was in floods of tears at the thought of being separated from her mother.</p> <p>In preparation for the journey, her father told her: \u201cEverything you\u2019ve been taught about Africa and Africans isn\u2019t true.\u201d They travelled through Egypt \u2013 taking a riverboat down the Nile \u2013 Sudan and Kenya, staying with families her father had supported in London. In Zanzibar a wealthy Arab family offered to have Hassan Howe come to live with them, to \u201craise her in Islam\u201d, and she went to live with the Souds and their five children. It was a privileged life: her father would visit, and Hassan Howe was happy until revolution struck the island in 1964.</p> <p>Zanzibar gained independence from the British empire in December 1963 and Hassan Howe remembers the celebrations when the British left. But the Soud household was part of the wealthy Arab elite that the British had empowered at the expense of the African population, and, when the sultan was overthrown in January 1964, they moved in with relatives for safety.</p> <p>\u201cOne day two men with guns came to the house and asked for me,\u201d says Hassan Howe. \u201cEverybody thought that was the end, and we were all praying.\u201d She was taken to the Revolutionary Council, who met in a stadium in the capital. Once there she was handed a telegram \u2013 it was from her mother telling her to \u201cget on the last plane that leaves Zanzibar\u201d. The Foreign Office had refused to evacuate Hassan Howe because she was a Zanzibar national but had agreed to ensure her safe passage if her family could pay for a flight.</p> <p>She returned to London to live with her mother and stepfather. But the England she came back to in 1964 was different to the one she had left. Mass immigration dominated the political scene, and hostility toward the black population was rife. At Plaistow Grammar school, she was one of only three black girls. \u201cIt was just horrendous. My life was just made hell. We\u2019d just be sitting there and you\u2019d get a tirade from other students against immigrants and against immigration. No one would play with us in the playground. It was a very isolated and lonely existence.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was unbelievable: we\u2019d leave our house and when you\u2019d hit Railton Road the police would stop you</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Home was no better: her white stepfather had \u201cvery racial views\u201d and black people were not allowed into her parents\u2019 working men\u2019s club. \u201cPeople were born in east London, worked in east London and died in east London,\u201d she says. Her time abroad meant, even if she wanted to, she \u201ccould not become a half-white, half-black East End girl, trying to accommodate a lot of the racism\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, reading became her salvation. Particularly the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/15/the-fire-this-time-legacy-of-james-baldwin\">James Baldwin</a>. At 18 she wrote a telegram to the African American author, an \u201coutpouring of me talking about race and racism and that his book [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/04/james-baldwin-the-fire-next-time-steve-shapiro\">The Fire Next Time</a>] had given me hope and experiences I could relate to\u201d. She still vividly remembers the reply she received: \u201c\u2018Keep the faith\u2019, signed \u2018Jimmy\u2019\u201d. When Baldwin died, the magazine she was editing at the time, Race Today, organised a memorial in Brixton town hall in February 1988, headlined by Maya Angelou.</p> <p>The Daily Telegraph became the unlikely key to her life as an activist, thanks to an advert for a job at the Institute of Race Relations. In 1971, she started working with the influential writer and activist Ambalavaner Sivanandan in the library. The institute was, she says, a \u201ccolonial, academic institution\u201d at the time, but the library had copies of newspapers from global liberation movements including the American Black Panther, and the latest information on racism in Britain \u2013 so British black power activists were frequent visitors.</p> <p>In 1971, Hassan Howe joined the Black Unity and Freedom party (BUFP) to fight for racial justice, and to challenge the idea that black people were \u201cthird-class citizens\u201d. After joining she was expected to sell 100 copies of the organisation\u2019s newspaper. She also taught maths and English to children, part of the grassroots <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/12/racism-schools-government-reforms-targets\">black supplementary school movement</a> that taught black children when the state was failing to do so.</p> <p>The BUFP demonstrated against police brutality, immigration legislation and in solidarity with global movements. But with Sivanandan, Hassan Howe decided to take action closer to home \u2013 to overthrow the Institute of Race Relations board \u2013 including the Booker brothers, whose wealth came from Caribbean plantations, as well as patrons who had been enriched by British colonies in Africa. First they \u201cpacked the membership\u201d by signing up left-leaning members of the public, so by 1972 they had enough members to pass a motion at the AGM to sack the council. The takeover meant the institute\u2019s magazine, Race Today, could also take an altogether more radical turn \u2013 hiring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/03/darcus-howe-obituary\">Darcus Howe</a> as editor in 1973.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce69e4f798412495c341084360ef7a6dea8e4921\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce69e4f798412495c341084360ef7a6dea8e4921/56_6_1128_1583/713.jpg\" alt=\"Race Today, February/March 1982 issue.\" width=\"713\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Race Today, February/March 1982 issue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Leila Hassan Howe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hassan Howe had first met Darcus in 1971 when he arrived at the library to do research. She next saw him at the interview for the editorship \u2013 which, \u201ctypically\u201d, she says, he only agreed to if he was offered the job in advance. The pair began a relationship in 1977 that was to last until Darcus Howe\u2019s death in 2017, marrying in 1989. Together they transformed Race Today into a beacon of black radical thought and practice. This began in the dead of night in August 1974. Hassan Howe, Darcus and other members of the staff loaded the equipment of the magazine into a post van \u2013 assisted by the British Black Panther Olive Morris. Then they drove to a squat in Brixton, where \u201cwe broke down the door, changed the locks and moved in\u201d.</p> <p>The move was to show how the magazine was now on the \u201cfront lines\u201d of Brixton to \u201crecord and recognise\u201d the struggles of the black working class. Darcus wanted to use the magazine to shift how society viewed black people \u201cfrom victims to protagonists. That we could shape our own history, we were not reliant on others, we could do it for ourselves\u201d. The pair were heavily influenced by the renowned intellectual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/02/beyond-a-boundary-broke-cricket-barriers\">CLR James</a>, Darcus Howe\u2019s uncle, who lived above the offices in Brixton, to use the power of a magazine to assist the burgeoning black power movement.</p> <p>Hassan Howe herself was deputy editor from 1973 and took over as editor in 1986. The magazine covered everything from politics to sport. I was educated by the black literature curated by the community and copies of Race Today were an essential part of this. Topics such as black nurses striking over pay conditions; Asian workers withdrawing their labour in Midlands factories; and the uprisings of black youth against the police were urgent to the community.</p> <p>The police were a persistent subject. Hassan Howe says the way \u201cthey policed us in colonial societies was the same way they policed here, which was with brute force\u201d. In 1981 the issue came to a head when the Metropolitan police force initiated Operation Swamp 81; in five days in April, they stopped and searched almost 1,000 people in Brixton. Hassan Howe says: \u201cIt was unbelievable: we\u2019d leave our house and when you\u2019d hit Railton Road they would stop you. Anybody going into Brixton. Old people, young people, people like me.\u201d Such tactics reminded her of apartheid-era South Africa \u2013 and the tension built for days. It erupted on 11 April, after a crowd wrongly believed that police were trying to arrest a stabbing victim, Michael Bailey. For two days the police lost control of Brixton as the youth rebelled against years of perceived abuse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/oct/01/paul-stephenson-the-hero-who-refused-to-leave-a-pub-and-helped-desegregate-britain\">Paul Stephenson: the hero who refused to leave a pub \u2013 and helped desegregate Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hassan Howe recalls that the rebellion was well organised.

Georgia\u2019s citizen\u2019s arrest law, which was enacted in 1863 to allow white citizens to capture slaves fleeing north, and was later used to justify hundreds of lynchings, was cited by a prosecutor last year who initially declined to arrest Arbery\u2019s assailants.</p> <p>Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, was jogging when he was chased and then gunned to death by three white men. His pursuers said they suspected him of robberies.</p> <p>The bill approved on Wednesday would strike citizen\u2019s arrest from state law, but would still allow security officers, private investigators, and off-duty officers to detain someone they believe has committed a crime. Kemp called the latter provisions a \u201ccritical balance\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI look forward to signing it into law as we continue to send a clear message that the Peach state will not tolerate sinister acts of vigilantism in our communities,\u201d Kemp said in a statement.</p> <p>Civil rights advocates have celebrated the bill\u2019s passage, and are pushing for similar reforms in other states. All 50 states have some form of citizen\u2019s arrest statute.</p> <p>Republicans have sided with Democrats in support of the bill, but critics say state Republicans\u2019 support for it serves to mask lawmakers\u2019 recent moves to heavily restrict voting access and limit Black citizens\u2019 ability to vote.</p> <p>Carl Gilliard, a Democrat who had long lobbied for the 1863 law\u2019s repeal, called it \u201coutdated and antiquated\u201d, saying it was steeped in racism.</p> <p>The Rev James Woodall, state president of the Georgia NAACP, called the repeal of the law \u201ca monumental moment in Georgia history\u201d.</p> <p>The father and son who pursued Arbery \u2013 Greg and Travis McMichael \u2013 were not arrested or charged until more than two months after Arbery\u2019s death.

But she thaws quickly, chatting to me as she moves through the house she shares with her partner, the activist Janaya Khan, and her six-year-old son. The camera comes on, and she eases into herself, breaking off briefly to message a friend who is going through a bereavement, and joking with Khan about needing too much coffee to get through the day.</p> <p>She is not a naturally guarded person. \u201cI was one of the first people in my friends group to go to therapy,\u201d she says. \u201cI grew up with a father who was in 12-step AA. I\u2019ve sat in those rooms and heard grown men cry. I\u2019ve always seen vulnerability as the way towards transformation and healing, and that\u2019s difficult because we don\u2019t live in a world that cares for Black people\u2019s vulnerability.\u201d</p> <p>Vulnerability defined her 90s childhood and drove her to activism. \u201cSome of this is personality and some of this is nurturing,\u201d she says. The third of four siblings, she was raised by a mother who was preoccupied by working and paying the bills. The man she thought of as her father \u201cwasn\u2019t there a lot and was a big headache for my mother,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She grew up feeling different from her siblings, then discovered that she was \u2013 her biological father was someone her mother had known during a brief separation from her siblings\u2019 father. Cullors didn\u2019t meet this man until she was 12. She never refers to the man she grew up with as her stepfather, but as \u201cthe father that raised me.\u201d For all his faults, she says, \u201cwhen it comes to his children, his words of affirmation are words that keep me going still. He never made me feel different or apart.\u201d</p> <p>Still, meeting her biological father explained a lot. Until then, she says, she felt \u201cpretty much like an alien the whole time. I love my family and siblings, but I was nothing like them. They\u2019re all introverts. I was rambunctious, loud, extrovert \u2013 wild hair and wild clothes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"991f7187059fd5007ba8f9eb6f310c240d5232b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/991f7187059fd5007ba8f9eb6f310c240d5232b6/0_0_5662_3632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cullors speaks at a Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign rally in Los Angeles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"641\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cullors speaks at a Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign rally in Los Angeles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Tullberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her difference was further accentuated by her sexuality. Cullors came out as queer at 16, and was promptly kicked out by her mother \u2013 a woman who, according to Cullors, \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe in queerness and transness.\u201d \u201cWe have very different accounts of what happened when I came out as queer,\u201d Cullors says. \u201cMy account is that I was kicked out. Her account is: \u2018I never kicked you out.\u2019 I was pretty much houseless during my last two years of high school.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a straightforward falling-out, though. Cullors\u2019 mother still checked in on her \u201call the time.\u201d \u201cI was hurt but I have so much compassion for my mom because of everything she went through as a parent.\u201d</p> <p>Poverty and policing moulded the rest of her personality. \u201cIt felt like we were being hunted as kids,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember waking up in the middle of the night and hearing the helicopters and seeing them shining their light in our window.\u201d The light was trained on her brother Monte and his friends hanging out outside.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone talks about the war on drugs; we don\u2019t talk about the war on gangs,\u201d she says, recalling a time in the 90s when disproportionate resources were mobilised towards inner-city gang policing. Helicopter policing is \u201cfucking expensive,\u201d she says, and a sign that the campaign was \u201cessentially the federal government declaring a war on brown and Black children and calling them domestic terrorists. We were living in a literal war zone. That is the context that made me an abolitionist.\u201d</p> <p>Monte was arrested in 1999 at the age of 19, and spent six years in LA prisons, after which he emerged with stories of torture, beatings, starvation and bed-chaining. His family lost him within the prison complex, where he would be moved between jails without notification or explanation. When they asked to visit or speak to him, Cullors says, information about his whereabouts was withheld. \u201cThey would do this thing where they would beat the shit out of somebody, almost kill them, then they would hide them in the jails for months. So you couldn\u2019t get a hold of your loved one, because they didn\u2019t want any proof of what they did. My brother was tortured multiple times.\u201d</p> <p>Against this tumultuous backdrop, Cullors was labelled \u201cgifted\u201d at a young age, and sent to a school in a white, affluent area. Travelling between her poor, working-class life and her new school jolted Cullors into outrage. \u201cIn my adolescent brain I was like: \u2018OK, I\u2019m living in this neighbourhood, experiencing policing on a daily basis. And then I go to a completely different neighbourhood during the day for school with people who are living a completely different life \u2013 they have no understanding of the police state.\u2019 I have access to all these resources. I\u2019m also realising that you can live differently. People have access to grocery stores and green space and I don\u2019t. I was like: \u2018This is unacceptable. It is unacceptable that I come home to police sirens and helicopter policing and that I go to school, where all these white kids are doing every drug under the sun and nothing is happening to them. Why not them, when they\u2019re actually the ones dealing the drugs?\u2019 I\u2019m talking about massive amounts of drugs that I would not have had access to if it wasn\u2019t for white communities. That wasn\u2019t right.\u201d</p> <p>In her early teens, she began to read the works of the civil rights <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/04/your-silence-will-not-protect-you-by-audre-lorder-review\">activist Audre Lorde</a> and autobiographies of Black Panther members, coming to the conclusion that there was a golden age of civic rights activism in the 60s and 70s that she missed out on. When she was 16, she went to a social justice camp run by the National Conference for Community and Justice. \u201cIt changed my life.\u201d Two hundred young people from across LA county were there, being taught about civil rights, identity and how to challenge racism and patriarchy. In the camp, she was introduced to the first civil rights organisation that she was a part of, the Bus Riders Union, a movement that challenges discriminatory policies affecting the overwhelmingly low-income African American, Latino and Asian users of public transport in Los Angeles county. That introduction was \u201cthe pivotal moment\u201d, she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70fee44aa511359530e5e97bfc61b3a1946f0dfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70fee44aa511359530e5e97bfc61b3a1946f0dfb/0_0_3000_2116/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(From left) Alicia Garza, Cullors and Opal Tometi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BLM founders \u2026 (from left) Alicia Garza, Cullors and Opal Tometi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She ended up staying at the Bus Riders Union for 11 years. She learned how to take on the state, and began to leverage it for her first passion \u2013 fighting and reforming the police. It was in 2013, while she was transitioning to abolition work, that Cullors first tweeted the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, after George Zimmerman was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/zimmerman-acquitted-killing-trayvon-martin\">acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin</a> in Florida. Then came her call to action, alongside fellow activists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/17/black-lives-matter-alicia-garza-leadership-today-doesnt-look-like-martin-luther-king\">Alicia Garza</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/24/opal-tometi-co-founder-of-black-lives-matter-i-do-this-because-we-deserve-to-live\">Opal Tometi</a>. At first, she says, \u201cwe didn\u2019t feel like owners of it. We didn\u2019t call ourselves co-founders of BLM until like a year later. The only reason we started to call ourselves co-founders is because it started to be co-opted. It started to be Black men using BLM as a way to tell their message, which was largely anti-woman or often anti-queer and trans. Or devoid of the conversation of feminism. And we were like: \u2018We\u2019ve gotta intervene.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>By 2014, Black Lives Matter had local chapters across the US. \u201cWhat we did, Alicia, Opal and I, is create infrastructure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/28/patrisse-khan-cullors-black-lives-matter-interview\">so that we could have language and a framework</a> around why police violence, vigilante violence, incarceration, were the greatest dangers to our community. We created a language around queerness and transness as not the enemy to Black people. My specific role was bringing people together, going across the country and world to talk about the tactic of protest, the tactic of what we call \u2018shutting shit down\u2019, of lifting up Blackness and being OK with saying: \u2018Black lives matter.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But BLM had grown too quickly. \u201cAt a certain point,\u201d she says, \u201cpeople wanted to start giving us money and we didn\u2019t have a legal infrastructure and we weren\u2019t sure we wanted one.\u201d Then George Floyd died under the knee of a policeman in the summer of 2020, and donations skyrocketed. BLMGNF took in just over $90m (\u00a367m) that year.</p> <p>Cullors and other BLM leaders have since come under intense scrutiny, with claims that too little of the money raised has reached those in need, while large sums have circulated around an opaque network of companies, some of them with links to Cullors.</p> <p>She concedes today that her executive position did not match her skills. \u201cI was trained,\u201d she says, \u201cto take a moment and help build a campaign around it.\u201d The problems started afterwards. Not only is Cullors better at motivation than management, she is also prone to abstractions. \u201cI\u2019m really interested in the best and possible ways we can access joy, healing, beauty and transformation,\u201d she says, when I ask what drives her.</p> <p>We run out of time just as Cullors is about to get into the difficulties of her time at the helm of BLM and agree to chat again the day after. When we speak the next morning, she seems wearier, more deflated than the day before.</p> <p>She has been thinking about a recent article in New York magazine headlined: \u201c<a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/01/black-lives-matter-finances.html\">The BLM mystery: where did the money go?</a>\u201d. It noted that in November 2020, 10 chapters of the BLMGNF had called for greater financial accountability, complaining that there was \u201cno acceptable process of either public or internal transparency about the unknown millions of dollars donated to BLMGNF\u201d. The article went on to imply that Cullors had turned her back on high-risk protest and activism in favour of collaborations with corporate sponsors, and of questionable transactions between her other organisations and BLM, none of which has been proven.</p> <p>It did, however, concede: \u201cThe deals could have reasonable explanations.\u201d As for Cullors\u2019 property portfolio, the magazine said: \u201cThere is no evidence that Cullors used money sent to BLMGNF to purchase personal property.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked multiple jobs across many organisations my entire life,\u201d Cullors <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9468847/BLM-founder-defends-3MILLION-property-portfolio-claims-questions-tactic-terror.html\">previously stated</a>. \u201cI\u2019m also a published author, writer, producer, professor, public speaker and performance artist \u2026 I work hard to provide for my family.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>Cullors had been \u201ccrying to a girlfriend\u201d about the New York magazine story, she says now, before she starts crying with me too.</p> <p>Attempts at greater transparency in the two years before she left BLM failed, she admits. \u201cI think it\u2019s because Black people in general have a hard time with money. It\u2019s a trigger point for us.\u201d She also thinks that they didn\u2019t do \u201cthe best job of telling our story. A lot of that has to do with being socialised as a woman and just wanting to do the work, not bragging about what we\u2019ve done, what we\u2019ve accomplished. Which is, I want to say on record, a great error. I do want to make it really clear that millions of dollars were put back into the community.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3b44563b0ba43e0e5b4a56b153eb3af3c218db1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b44563b0ba43e0e5b4a56b153eb3af3c218db1c/0_0_3500_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I do want to make it really clear that millions of dollars were put back into the community.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I do want to make it really clear that millions of dollars were put back into the community.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Cheung/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And she still thinks she can make a contribution, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/30/abolitionists-still-have-work-to-do-in-america\">as she focuses on police abolition</a>. \u201cI was thrust into a global spotlight, but at the end of the day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/24/patrisse-khan-cullors-activist-black-lives-matter-interview\">I\u2019m a local community organiser</a>.

That is drama and trauma. I have enough of that. Let me go be an influencer on TikTok.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Cullors seems constantly to be treading a fine line between humility and hurt, between letting go but also claiming what is due to her. \u201cYou\u2019re catching me at a place of deep, deep self-reflection,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I look forward to many more years ahead where I can look back with more fondness.

     "body": "<p>When George Floyd was in high school, his teacher Bertha Dinkins prophetically told the teen: \u201cI want to read about you in the newspaper\u2026 that you have made history and done something to change society\u201d. She could never have foretold that Floyd would become a household name because the world watched a video of police officer Derek Chauvin slowly choke him to death with his knee on his neck in 2020.</p> <p>The killing sparked the largest protests ever against racial injustice, prompting society to discuss racism in ways it has not done for more than a generation. <em>His Name </em><em>Is George Floyd</em> (written by two <em>Washington Post</em> reporters) attempts to use the life and death of Floyd as a vehicle to examine the bigotry that lies at the heart of the present-day US.</p> <p>Figures that spark protests are often barely drawn in two dimensions: we have a name, an image and little else. We know Emmett Till \u2013 whose lynching in 1955 is credited with sparking the civil rights movement after his mother displayed his disfigured body in an open casket \u2013 as a 14-year-old killed for supposedly whistling at a white woman. Trayvon Martin \u2013 whose killing by George Zimmerman in 2012 ignited the Black Lives Matter movement \u2013 is the teenager in a hoodie who died for going to a shop to buy Skittles.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The authors make a valiant effort to use Floyd\u2019s story to educate society about the ills of structural racism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In this age of misinformation, where the victims of police killings are made out to be the problem, this humanising of Floyd is necessary. The book does not paint him as a saint but explains his flaws in the context of his experiences. Yes, he was an addict, a convict, and even made a porn movie. But these are not separate from his role as a father, friend and the backbone of his family and community. It is welcome that Floyd<strong> </strong>is no longer an anonymous Black man and you can feel the devastation of his family, friends and community in the interviews that pepper the book.</p> <p>Samuels and Olorunnipa\u2019s greatest triumph is placing Floyd\u2019s life in the context of white supremacy. Before we get to Floyd, we learn about his ancestors\u2019 struggles as tenant farmers in the period after slavery was abolished, known as \u201creconstruction\u201d. Rather than abolition marking an end to racism, we grasp how the logic of racism continued<strong>.</strong> Racist laws and segregation became the tools for keeping the Black population oppressed. Floyd\u2019s great-grandfather was stripped of the land and money he had managed to accumulate in tobacco farming, leaving the family in the poverty that was passed down through the generations.</p> <p>The authors<strong> </strong>reflect on the irony of Floyd being killed after allegedly buying cigarettes with a fake $20 bill, given his family\u2019s history with tobacco. Throughout, Floyd\u2019s life is used to discuss issues such as racial terrorism, housing segregation, mass incarceration and racism in schooling. The point is driven home that his life and death were a result of the racism built into American society. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2020/08/29/david-smith-death-minneapolis-police-kneeling/\">David Smith</a> was killed by Minneapolis police in 2010, in an almost identical manner to Floyd, but there was no public outcry.</p> <p>There is a way in which all the attention on Floyd\u2019s death has in some way limited the conversation: we all agree that his murder was indefensible,<strong> </strong>Derek Chauvin went to prison, minimal policing reforms occurred\u2026 and now we can move on. <em>His Name </em><em>Is George Floyd</em> adds to this narrative by focusing on this one event and its aftermath. The lack of any global context severely limits our understanding of racism, which,<strong> </strong>as Malcolm X explained, is \u201cnot just an American problem, but a world problem\u201d.</p> <p>The focus on Floyd also follows the unfortunate pattern of highlighting the plight of Black men, reinforcing how we are drawn to the spectacle.

The Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka was told to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/naomiosaka/status/1305959039902257152\">\u201ckeep politics out of sport\u201d</a> when she brought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/01/naomi-osaka-us-open-misaki-doi\">seven face masks with the names of different victims of police brutality</a> to the US Open. Almost 2,000 people complained to Ofcom \u2013 which has yet to decide whether to investigate \u2013 about the BLM necklace worn by Alesha Dixon on Britain\u2019s Got Talent (only a few weeks after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/17/ofcom-dismisses-complaints-over-blm-dance-on-britains-got-talent\">the programme received 24,500 complaints \u2013 later dismissed by the regulator \u2013 about a performance by the dance group Diversity</a> that was inspired by the police killing of George Floyd).</p> <p>The framing of these moments as radical and political rather than sincere and teachable has raised other questions, such as: are black lives allowed to matter in public spaces \u2013 public spaces that are normally the home of white privilege?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0a6c71b8ae10e16c5815980160db62802371c6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0a6c71b8ae10e16c5815980160db62802371c6a/0_0_1080_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yvonne Orji had the black power fist shaved into her hair for the Emmys\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Nuff said\u2019 ...

The fashion historian Darnell-Jamal Lisby says BLM clothes are perceived as threatening because they \u201cshake the belief that conditioned the world to believe that white people are superior\u201d. He says they \u201cdisrupt a system that privileges those who benefited from the oppression of black people\u201d. As such, the wearing of BLM clothing is suppressed (as in the case of Hamilton) or heavily criticised (as Dixon experienced).</p> <p>Last month\u2019s Emmys were especially powerful not only because of the number of celebrities wearing BLM clothes, but also because the intimate nature of the ceremony (with nominees filmed at home) made their clothes feel more personal than if they were on a red carpet.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/23/sterling-k-brown-black-panther-marvel-people-oj-simpson-this-is-us\">Sterling K Brown</a> of This Is Us wore a dinner jacket over a T-shirt emblazoned with a BLM logo and a black power fist. Yvonne Orji, best known for Insecure, had the fist shaved into her hair. Killing Eve\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/modooborahae/status/1307899586170753027\">Sandra Oh</a> wore a beautiful purple jacket with \u201cBlack lives are precious\u201d written on it in Korean.</p> <p>The T-shirt worn by the Watchmen writer Damon Lindelof was affecting, too. It bore the words \u201cRemember Tulsa \u201921\u201d, which referenced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/01/tulsa-massacre-1921-oklahoma-lawsuit\">the 1921 Tulsa massacre</a>, in which as many as 300 black residents of the city in Oklahoma were killed by white mobs.

Last month Chauvin was convicted of second-degree murder and two other felonies and faces up to 40 years in prison. Three other officers involved in the arrest are awaiting trial.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the first anniversary of Floyd\u2019s death, Joe Biden will meet the Floyd family at the White House as negotiations continue in Congress over police reform legislation. The foundation will also host a \u201ccelebration of life\u201d event at a downtown park in Minneapolis.</p> <p>\u201cWe will celebrate the life and legacy of George Floyd through Black culture, art, history and support of local businesses,\u201d organizers said, adding there will be performances from a number of local and \u201cGrammy award-winning artists\u201d.</p> <p>On Friday the foundation awarded a $25,000 scholarship to Fayetteville State University, a historically Black college in North Carolina.</p> <p>Bridgett Floyd presented the check to the university and said: \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about \u2013 generational stamps.

While ending or restricting qualified immunity is largely seen as a must-have for police reform advocates, it is staunchly <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/14/police-reform-police-unions-qualified-immunity-democratic-party-420122\">opposed by police unions</a>.</p> <p>\u201cMy concern is, and I\u2019ve communicated this to the White House, is that we come with a toothless bill to meet a hard deadline,\u201d Sharpton, president of the National Action Network, told <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/05/22/biden-floyd-police-reform-deadline-490206\">Politico</a>. \u201cI\u2019d rather have a bill with teeth late than a toothless bill on time.\u201d</p> <p>Since Floyd\u2019s killing, at least 17 states, including Minnesota, have enacted legislation to ban or restrict the use of chokeholds and neck restraints by police officers, according to data provided to the Associated Press by the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p> <p>Before then, only two states, Tennessee and Illinois, had bans on such police hold techniques. A majority of the bans enacted over the past year are in states controlled politically by Democrats.</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>"

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/03/george-floyd-justice-in-policing-act-us-house-democrats\">George Floyd Justice in Policing Act</a> has not passed. We need it to pass.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chauvin knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes. He was sentenced on Friday to 22 and a half years in prison, a penalty applauded by activists across the US.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll over the United States,\u201d said Ellison, a former congressman, \u201cstates are looking at police reform. We need them to act. We need departments to act. We need prosecutors and we need other police officers to look inside and say, \u2018What can we do to build greater trust and greater cooperation with our communities that we protect and serve every day?\u2019</p> \n<p>\u201c\u2026 From a larger perspective, we have got a lot of lifting to do. And when it comes to Congress, I think they could lead the way by passing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. I think it\u2019s essential, and the country needs it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The act named for Floyd <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/03/george-floyd-justice-in-policing-act-us-house-democrats\">passed the Democratic-controlled House</a> but has stalled in the Senate. Key provisions include ending qualified immunity for police officers, which Republicans oppose, and establishing a national standard for the use of force.</p> \n<p>Some Republicans have sought to link a rise in violent crime to efforts for police reform. Senior White House adviser Cedric Richmond, another former congressman, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union: \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to conflate the two.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd we support the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. But we also support investing in these cities, so that they can replenish their law enforcement and we can tackle gun violence, where the guns are coming from, who\u2019s using the guns. How do we do it in a comprehensive manner, so that we employ violent crime interrupters?</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd so we want to do it in a very smart way. And we need the police to have a better relationship with the communities. We need constitutional policing, and we need our communities to trust our police.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd so I\u2019m glad that they\u2019re still negotiating and working together, both Democrats and Republicans.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a3419bc-ca21-444c-a129-db974820d580\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7Z4AXlHBtJw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In Ellison\u2019s home state on Saturday, Democrats and Republicans reached agreement on a public safety bill that includes police accountability measures.</p> \n<p>While some details remained to be finalized, leaders said the compromise settled major issues after months of talks. It has been the most contentious piece of budget negotiations before a Wednesday deadline to avoid a government shutdown.</p> \n<p>The Democratic-controlled Minnesota House included several policing provisions in its public safety budget bill, in the hope of building on a package approved in the aftermath Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>The 223-page draft bill includes provisions regulating the use of no-knock warrants, a police misconduct database, and the creation of an office of missing and murdered indigenous relatives and a task force for missing and murdered Black women.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t include some of the important police reform and accountability measures pushed by the House,\u201d Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman said, \u201cbut it is a step forward in delivering true public safety and justice for all Minnesotans despite divided government.\u201d</p> \n<p>Democrats advocated for limits on pretextual traffic stops, where police pull over a driver for a minor violation, such as expired tabs or something hanging from the rearview mirror. That push intensified after an officer in suburban Brooklyn Center shot and killed Daunte Wright after stopping him for driving with expired tabs. That proposal is not part of the agreement.</p> \n<p>Republicans who control the Minnesota Senate called some Democratic proposals \u201canti-police\u201d, focusing on those pushing to abolish the police and on violent protests following Floyd\u2019s killing.</p> \n<p>The agreement includes $2m for violent crime enforcement teams, a Republican-backed provision.</p>"

But their actions, considered to be one of the most significant and symbolic acts of public dissent in Britain this century, sent shock waves that are still being felt nationally and globally.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"100867103aa74884c9fbd045ae68ef47b3e2368f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/100867103aa74884c9fbd045ae68ef47b3e2368f/0_21_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left to right: Milo Ponsford, 26, Sage Willoughby, 22, Jake Skuse, 33, and Rhian Graham, 30.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left to right: Milo Ponsford, 26, Sage Willoughby, 22, Jake Skuse, 33, and Rhian Graham, 30.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The toppling of Colston \u2013 which came just two weeks after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/29/george-floyd-death-benjamin-crump-jasmine-rand\">murder of George Floyd</a> by Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, sparked antiracist protests around the world \u2013 exploded like a cultural hand grenade.</p> <p>It catalysed a nationwide reassessment of the symbols of Britain\u2019s imperialist past. Within six months nearly 70 tributes to slave traders, colonialists and racists were removed across the UK, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/29/tributes-to-slave-traders-and-colonialists-removed-across-uk\">Guardian</a> tally found, as conversations intensified over which historical figures were appropriate for public veneration.</p> <p>Reverberations were felt as far away as the US where, at the funeral of Floyd himself, Rev Al Sharpton referenced the protest as symbolic of changing attitudes to race, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve seen grandchildren of slave masters tearing down slave masters statue; over in England they put it in the river.\u201d</p> <p>And it triggered outrage on the right. Dozens of so-called \u201cstatue defender\u201d protests across the UK culminated in a chaotic rally by football fans around the statue of Winston Churchill in Trafalgar Square. Impassioned commentators compared protesters to a \u201cwoke Taliban\u201d and warned of efforts to erase British history.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot now try to edit or censor our past,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/12/boris-johnson-says-removing-statues-is-to-lie-about-our-history-george-floyd\">the prime minister tweeted</a>.</p> <p>But as much as it was a trigger for a broader debate, the toppling of Colston\u2019s statue was also the culmination of a uniquely Bristolian story. Erected in 1895, 174 years after Colston\u2019s death, the bronze likeness celebrated a man regarded by some as the city\u2019s philanthropic patron saint.</p> <p>He had given his name to three schools in the city and half a dozen roads, and a number of Bristol\u2019s most ancient institutions owed their existence to his largesse.</p> <p>Every year celebrations were held in Bristol cathedral in Colston\u2019s name. Leading pupils from the schools that bore his name were taken on pilgrimages to see a clump of his hair and his nails preserved like relics in the city\u2019s Merchants Hall.</p> <p>A plaque attached to the plinth on which Colston\u2019s statue stood celebrated him as \u201cone of the most virtuous and wise sons\u201d of Bristol.</p> <p>But concerns had long been raised over his presence. Looming over the heart of south-west England\u2019s most multicultural city, Colston had served as a potent reminder that its wealth was raised off the backs of enslaved people.</p> <p>Giving expert evidence in the trial, the historian David Olusoga described how Colston had made his fortune as shareholder, and eventual head, of Britain\u2019s most-important slave-owning enterprise, the Royal African Company. During his tenure, it kidnapped and enslaved an estimated 85,000 Africans, including 12,000 children.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, it was symbolic of power and lack of respect, and the position of black people as a community,\u201d Ros Martin, a playwright and activist for many years with the Countering Colston campaign, told the Guardian.</p> <p>She said she felt the trial was an \u201cappalling injustice\u201d but that she felt buoyed up by \u201cthe fact that [the defendants] are four young white people feeling empathy and showing empathy and getting people to think\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s moving beyond being a bystander, which is required from all of us,\u201d Martin said.</p> <p>Throughout the 10-day trial, the public gallery was packed with locals, many of whom cheered videos shown in court of the moment Colston fell. Martin was there, and other supporters and friends of the defendants.</p> <p>But others, such as Douglas Peden, a local lawyer, and his two daughters, had come to watch history play out in the courtroom. \u201cIt\u2019s the symbolism of it,\u201d Peden said, admitting he also supported the defendants. \u201cIt\u2019s property and ownership up against freedom of expression.\u201d</p> <p>The feeling was reflected elsewhere in Bristol. Outside a pub in Bristol city centre after court one evening Jodie Lily, from Exeter, told the Guardian she knew at least 10 people who were present when the statue was toppled. \u201cIt\u2019s only those four because they got their faces,\u201d she said. \u201cThat piece of shit should have been taken down.\u201d</p> <p>The bare facts of the case were not in question. Giving evidence, the defendants proudly recounted the roles they played. But they denied criminal damage, arguing their acts were justified by the offence caused in Bristol by the statue.</p> <p>It was a high-risk legal strategy, given that support for the toppling of Colston was not universal, even in Bristol. A week after the statue was felled, a counter protest by the empty plinth drew a 300-strong crowd, including a banner reading \u201call lives matter\u201d.</p> <p>Concerns were felt across the UK. Polling by <a href=\"https://policyexchange.org.uk/historymatterspolling/\">Policy Exchange</a> found nearly half of people opposed the way the statue was toppled, compared with a quarter in support, while <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/philosophy/survey-results/daily/2020/06/08/1ab21/1\">YouGov found</a> that although a slim majority supported Colston\u2019s removal, just more than one in 10 thought it was done in the right way.</p> <p>Nevertheless, change has since come in the wake of Colston\u2019s toppling. Colston Hall, Bristol\u2019s major events venue, changed its name \u2013 finally fulfilling an undertaking first made in 2017 \u2013 to the Bristol Beacon.</p> <p>Colston\u2019s name was removed from pubs, buildings and roads. The 275-year-old Colston society was disbanded and his image was removed from stained glass windows.</p> <p>But at the same time, culture war battle lines were drawn, and the government sensed a populist win. Skuse, Graham, Ponsford and Milo have been cleared but <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/police-crime-sentencing-and-courts-bill-2021-factsheets/police-crime-sentencing-and-courts-bill-2021-criminal-damage-to-memorials-factsheet\">new measures in the government\u2019s police and crime bill</a> will allow courts to send people found guilty of damaging a memorial to prison for 10 years.</p> <p>As critics <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/new-crime-bill-makes-protecting-statues-more-important-than-punishing-rape-says-labour-12248534\">have pointed out</a>, someone caught defacing a statue could, under the proposals, be jailed for longer than someone found guilty of rape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b22e486d5080796c53b138e116057ac0d4affae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b22e486d5080796c53b138e116057ac0d4affae/0_168_5031_3019/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The toppled statue lies on display in M Shed museum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The toppled statue lies on display in M Shed museum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Polly Thomas/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As for Colston himself, since being fished out of the River Avon by Bristol council, his statue has found his way to the city\u2019s M Shed museum, where it has been transformed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/04/edward-colston-statue-potent-historical-artefact-david-olusoga\">according to Olusoga</a>, into \u201cthe most important artefact\u201d of the story of Britain\u2019s relationship with its brutal slave history.</p> <p>There, the statue of the old slave trader lies supine, with red paint daubed on its eyes, mouth and hands.

Ky\u2019s Instagram account features her using wire, wool and needles to create political hair art structures that symbolise police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>\u201cThe purpose of my art has always been to fight for equality, to empower people and to promote the beauty of blackness,\u201d Ky, 25, says. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine stopping using my art to fight.\u201d</p> <p>Ky takes inspiration from the coifs of pre-colonial Africa, where certain tribes would mould their hair to express power and strength. These hairstyles were documented in photographs by white travellers and anthropologists and rendered by artists.</p> <p>Tulloch mentions a cover of Harper\u2019s Bazaar featuring an illustration by the artist Aaron Douglas from 1927 with a Mangbetu woman whose hair is \u201cfanned out into a broad trump\u201d, and a sculpture by Dora Gordine from 1928 featuring \u201cthe head of a black woman from Guadeloupe, her seemingly natural hair moulded \u2026 to create a high crown\u201d.</p> <p>For Ky, hair sculpture is a perfect merging of art and activism. \u201cUsing a creative way to speak about important topics is a very efficient way to raise awareness,\u201d she says.</p>"

Mattingly accused \u201cthe media, celebrities, sports figures, attorneys, and politicians\u201d of spreading \u201cblatant lies about the situation without any accountability\u201d, adding that while he was \u201cgrateful to my friends\u201d at Post Hill, \u201cI have decided it is best that I explore other publishing options for my book\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/apr/01/remembering-breonna-taylor-through-art-it-keeps-her-alive\">'It keeps her alive': remembering Breonna Taylor through art</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Post Hill Press publisher Anthony Ziccardi <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/police-officer-in-breonna-taylor-shooting-seeks-new-book-publisher-11629318016\">told the Wall Street Journal</a> that after the press had informed Mattingly that it couldn\u2019t distribute the book without Simon &amp; Schuster, \u201che thought it was best to find another publisher who could fully distribute the book. We wish him success.\u201d</p> <p>Mattingly compared himself to the US senator Josh Hawley, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/18/josh-hawley-book-publisher-simon-schuster\">whose book was dropped by Simon &amp; Schuster after his role in the Capitol riots</a>, saying he was \u201cnot the first person to be cancelled by the publishing industry for going against the \u2018woke\u2019 narrative\u201d. Hawley subsequently found a new home for his title with the conservative press Regnery.</p> <p>\u201cWhether you\u2019re a United States senator or a cop from Louisville, the left doesn\u2019t want your story to be told if you stand in its way,\u201d wrote Mattingly. </p> <p>He did not reveal whether a new publisher has picked up his book.</p>"

And probably, regrettably, a bit of intolerance was shown,\u201d Hamm said.</p> <p>Around one in five Australians have recently experienced a form of major discrimination, described in the report as including \u201ctypes of serious unfair treatment, such as being unfairly denied a promotion or job, or discouraged from continuing education\u201d.</p> <p>Young people and Aboriginal people were the groups that reported experiencing the most discrimination, with a sharp rise in reported discrimination towards Indigenous people in December 2019 onwards:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v15/index.html?key=15z1ekRyQxWxDnJiqZfyiQfOlAD0nqA_pHeKDv--fbrs&amp;location=docsdata\" data-alt=\"% of people in minority groups who report experiencing at least one form of major discrimination in the past two years\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v15/index.html?key=15z1ekRyQxWxDnJiqZfyiQfOlAD0nqA_pHeKDv--fbrs&location=docsdata\">% of people in minority groups who report experiencing at least one form of major discrimination in the past two years</a> </figure>  <p>Hamm said the Black Lives Matter movement has been a \u201cpinch point\u201d for racial intolerance.</p> <p>\u201cWhile we\u2019ve gone a long way to advance on a lot of issues, the anchor point hasn\u2019t really moved in 30 years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have more Aboriginal people in custody per head of population than we did in the 1990s. The rate of average death in custody hasn\u2019t improved. If you take that as a starting point, then you can see why it\u2019s sensitive to people. But some people take the view of \u2018what\u2019s the problem?\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cI think the Black Lives Matter movement really was a pinch point on that. The timing of it, in terms of when Covid was really happening, could not have been worse in regard of how did the Aboriginal protest movements across Australia look, at a time when everybody was being told to socially distance, was being told that we had to close borders, we had to not go outside, and all of a sudden you\u2019ve got all these people on the streets protesting.</p> <p>\u201cI think the other thing is that people are reporting it, or the mechanisms to seek out the reporting of it have improved. So there\u2019s a combination of things.\u201d</p> <p>The survey also measured \u201ceveryday\u201d discrimination, defined as \u201cmore chronic, routine, and relatively minor experiences of unfair treatment\u201d, like \u201cbeing treated with less respect and courtesy, receiving poorer service than others at restaurants or stores, or being called names\u201d.</p> <p>Everyday discrimination was highest for Aboriginal people among the groups surveyed, with a sharp rise from December 2018 onwards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v15/index.html?key=1aoxk8YbQpJfJ-DYI1ldpxHsx4AWJgmAKmZuPVnrEf4k&amp;location=docsdata\" data-alt=\"% of people in minority groups who report experiencing one or more forms of everyday discrimination at least weekly\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v15/index.html?key=1aoxk8YbQpJfJ-DYI1ldpxHsx4AWJgmAKmZuPVnrEf4k&location=docsdata\">% of people in minority groups who report experiencing one or more forms of everyday discrimination at least weekly</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe rise in direct discrimination at the personal level \u2013 that\u2019s the really worrying one,\u201d Hamm said. \u201cThat fundamentally says there are people who have taken it upon themselves to be obnoxious to another person, for no other reason than they feel entitled to.\u201d</p> <p>The report examined how intersectionality influences discrimination, or where people identify with multiple, intersecting groups at the same time. Those who belong to more than one minority group tend to experience more discrimination and have lower scores for personal wellbeing:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v15/index.html?key=1QrS33kJsEJMj9w1BrtdLmYAmiuNBiWFZAyOTu4kdARw&amp;location=docsdata\" data-alt=\"Discrimination and wellbeing by number of minority groups\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v15/index.html?key=1QrS33kJsEJMj9w1BrtdLmYAmiuNBiWFZAyOTu4kdARw&location=docsdata\">Discrimination and wellbeing by number of minority groups</a> </figure>  <p>LGBTIQ+ Indigenous people experienced the highest rates of discrimination out of any intersectional groups.</p> <p>Hamm said political and social leadership is needed to reverse these trends.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things that comes with political leadership, should you ever seek high office, is having a moral and ethical compass, and it\u2019s not simply responding to what you think the community wants, but it\u2019s sometimes saying: this is where we need to go, regardless of what the majority might think. That\u2019s real leadership,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYou are expected and indeed you should be doing it because you actually have a vision of how things might be better.\u201d</p> <p>The report found that most Australians are not highly prejudiced, but a \u201csizeable minority are\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMany Australians continued to have little to no contact with certain minority groups, and lack of contact was associated with higher prejudice,\u201d it said.</p>"
