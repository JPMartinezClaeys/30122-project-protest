     "body": "<p>A majority of people believe Black Lives Matter, the anti-racism movement that spread across the UK this summer, has increased racial tension, according to a poll.</p> <p>Just over half (55%) of UK adults believe the BLM protests that took place in big cities but also in the Shetland Islands and the Isle of Wight, increased racial tensions, according to a survey of more than 2,000 people by pollsters Opinium. Only 17% of the people polled in October disagreed. The polling also showed 44% of ethnic minorities felt BLM increased racial tensions.</p> <p>The findings, which BLM organisers said showed the movement has exposed existing fault lines, comes alongside parallel research indicating sharp rises in the number of black people saying they faced discrimination in the last year, rising from 74% in 2019 to 81%. In a possible sign of racism arising from the origin of Covid-19 in Wuhan, the proportion of Chinese people saying they faced discrimination over the same period rose from 68% to 76%, according to polling carried out in June.</p> <p>Opinium\u2019s annual survey of multicultural Britain also found that 71% of Asian people had suffered discrimination or abuse because of their ethnicity, rising to 81% among black people.</p> <p>\u201cA particularly worrying find is that the majority of BAME people have faced discrimination because of their race and ethnicity,\u201d said Mete Coban, the director of My Life My Say, a youth-led charity aimed at increasing engagement with democracy. \u201cAnother saddening finding is that 46% of BAME people have faced discrimination on multiple occasions, which is an increase from last year.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2020-11-27T11:18:15/embed.html\" data-alt=\"BLM chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2020-11-27T11:18:15/embed.html\">BLM chart</a> </figure>  <p>White people were more likely to believe that the BLM movement, which was given fresh momentum by global outrage at the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May, had increased racial tensions, Opinium found. Those citing that concern most were Conservative voters, with 78% saying they believed it had inflamed tensions and just 6% saying it hadn\u2019t.</p> <p>Race relations experts point out that senior Conservatives attacked BLM in forthright language, with the former chancellor Sajid Javid saying last month it was \u201cneo-Marxist\u201d and \u201cnot a force for good\u201d. Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, has urged schools not to support the \u201cpolitical\u201d movement in lessons.</p> <p>Asked about the survey, Adam Elliott-Cooper, a spokesman for BLM, said racial tensions in Britain long preceded the movement and that it had highlighted the issue.</p> <p>\u201cTo say that to challenge racism increases racial tension is a very misleading assumption,\u201d he said. \u201cBlack Lives Matter hasn\u2019t increased racial tension in the same way as the civil rights movement in the US didn\u2019t or the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa didn\u2019t. They haven\u2019t increased racial tension but they might have made it more apparent and exposed what is there.\u201d</p> <p>The resurgence of the BLM movement this year triggered a series of actions, which many felt were overdue, but others found controversial. These included the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/15/edward-colston-statue-replaced-by-sculpture-of-black-lives-matter-protester\">dumping of a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston</a> into Bristol\u2019s dock, and a wave of investigations into British institutions\u2019 slavery links. A 2017 book by Reni Eddo-Lodge called Why I\u2019m No Longer Talking to White People About Race, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/16/reni-eddo-lodge-first-black-british-author-top-uk-book-charts-why-i-m-no-longer-talking-to-white-people-about-race\">shot back up the bestseller charts</a>.</p> <p>Prof Kalwant Bhopal, director of the Centre for Research in Race and Education at the University of Birmingham, said the results suggested BLM had made some white people \u201cfeel their privilege is being threatened and questioned\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they see something like BLM they do what they can to protect it and there is a backlash,\u201d she said. She added that the response of some institutions, such as universities, to pledge support for the goals of BLM, had created a \u201cmask of inclusion\u201d which obscured a reluctance to deliver real change. This was seen by some minority ethnic people as evidence of division, she said.</p>"

     "body": "<p>All but one plinth is now bare on Monument Avenue in Richmond, Virginia.</p> <p>Where once stood enormous statues glorifying Confederate leaders, on a thoroughfare that memorialized a white supremacist past in the former capital of the Confederacy, there is now empty space. The only monument that remains is of a black man: the Richmond native and renowned tennis player and activist Arthur Ashe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/09/statute-robert-e-lee-richmod-removed-comment\">It\u2019s shameful that it took so long to bring down the statue of Robert E Lee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now, Richmond is poised to determine what will join Ashe\u2019s statue on the avenue\u2019s malls: another symbolic step toward reconciling the city\u2019s ties with slavery and the Lost Cause of the US civil war.</p> <p>Decades-long demands from activists to remove each homage in bronze to Confederates reached their greatest furor at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020. Graffiti, light projections, signs and memorials to black and brown lives lost to police violence transmuted the former Robert E Lee monument into a symbol of protest.</p> <p>The grassy circle where Lee once stood was informally renamed to honor Marcus David Peters, a black high school teacher fatally shot by police in 2018 during a mental health crisis. And a grieving community expressed its pain with memorials denouncing police violence, with street art, black ballerinas, small libraries and a community garden.</p> <p>On a street in an elite, white neighborhood where many black people had felt unwelcome in the presence of the statues, interracial and intergenerational gatherings and peaceful protests shifted the atmosphere \u2013 until state leaders erected a fence around the site at the beginning of 2021, says the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/auz_can/?hl=en\">Richmond muralist Austin \u201cAuz\u201d Miles</a>, who frequented the space.</p> <p>\u201cIt just became an activated space \u2026 with a community-like, homecoming feel,\u201d she says. \u201cIt felt all of a sudden like a safe space \u2026 where people were coming in and out and doing things, and displaying their art. I felt sad when they put the gates up and no one could continue to beautify it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0252a3ccc16bfd7c49b7dc024048c08d2dc96809\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0252a3ccc16bfd7c49b7dc024048c08d2dc96809/0_0_4391_2927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The likeness of the tennis star and civil rights activist Arthur Ashe is the only statue remaining on Monument Avenue.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The likeness of the tennis star and civil rights activist Arthur Ashe is the only statue remaining on Monument Avenue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Helber/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Governor Ralph Northam\u2019s office says the fence, which remains, was erected so the state could expeditiously remove Lee, pending the resolution of a legal battle that lasted for more than a year, with a group of Monument Avenue residents who aimed to protect the statue. Their lawsuit had cited fears of diminished property values and loss of tax credits on their homes.</p> <p>But on 8 September, the Lee monument \u2013 its reimagining declared the most influential piece of protest art since the second world war by the New York Times \u2013 was the last Confederate statue on the street to come down. Several of the roadway\u2019s monuments had been removed in 2020 under emergency powers by Richmond\u2019s mayor, Levar Stoney, and angry crowds toppled a statue of Jefferson Davis, former president of the Confederate states.</p> <p>But the removal of the statues is not an ending. Now comes a new beginning and the debate on public memory and how that is expressed by a city\u2019s public art.</p> <p>The Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, one of the largest museums in the US for exhibition space, has been tapped by the state to lead work to redefine Monument Avenue, in collaboration with the city and other partners.</p> <p>Richmond residents, state and local politicians, artists, activists and historians have varying visions for Monument Avenue. Public art is widely viewed as a tool to tell a more complete and honest narrative of Richmond\u2019s struggles with equality. And how the city decides to uplift people and places with public art has the potential to be a nationwide model, or a litany of pitfalls to avoid, and it\u2019s imperative that Richmond get it right, says activist, community organizer and social worker Chelsea Higgs Wise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"881fbba1dcc914ce5756203f9185cad2c1523453\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/881fbba1dcc914ce5756203f9185cad2c1523453/0_192_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The area around the Robert E Lee statue in August 2020, at the height of racial justice protests.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The area around the Robert E Lee statue in August 2020, at the height of racial justice protests.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Tuite/ImageSpace/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA quarter of black people in the United States have roots from Richmond, Virginia, due to the domestic trade of enslaved Africans that took place here. So \u2026 what we are going through with telling our story is very much telling a national story,\u201d Higgs Wise says. \u201cAnd if we have yet to reckon with our history \u2013 and have yet to see that the removal of a large monument does not a reconciliation process make \u2013 then how are we supposed to model what it looks like for the rest of the south and the country?\u201d</p> <p>Richmond has earned failing marks on its art projects in the past. The placement of a statue of Arthur Ashe on Monument Avenue in 1996, the likeness of a black man alongside that of Confederates, was widely regarded as tone deaf. Ashe himself is deservedly revered, Richmonders say, but the design of the statue (which depicts Ashe raising a tennis racket and books above children) and its scale compared with others on the street, is questionable, adds Higgs Wise.</p> <p>\u201cUpon first look, unfortunately you\u2019re unsure if he\u2019s raising his tennis racket to be excited or if he\u2019s going to bring it down on the children that are below him,\u201d she says.</p> <p>City government can often be slow to act on initiatives proposed by artists and embracing new art traditions, says <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sillygenius/?hl=en\">Taron Sparks, a Richmond muralist known as \u201cSilly Genius\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of older people on [the public art commission] \u2026 and they\u2019re mostly coming from the fine art world,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s this extra layer of red tape with doing projects in the city.\u201d</p> <p>But Richmond has done better recently. This week the Dr Martin Luther King Memorial Commission unveiled the Emancipation and Freedom Monument in a popular James River park, a short stroll from the American Civil War Museum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b14bee8dc8f6de298cc7e22fe21925f17a8462ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b14bee8dc8f6de298cc7e22fe21925f17a8462ae/0_79_2820_1693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children play near the Emancipation and Freedom Monument, designed by Thomas Jay Warren, on the day it was unveiled in Richmond, Virginia, on 22 September.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children play near the Emancipation and Freedom Monument, designed by Thomas Jay Warren, on the day it was unveiled in Richmond, Virginia, on 22 September.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jay Paul/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 12ft work depicts a man and woman recently freed from bondage, and honors notable black Virginians on its base. In 2017, a sculpture celebrating the Richmond native and nationally recognized businesswoman and civic leader Maggie L Walker was placed on Broad Street, Richmond\u2019s largest thoroughfare.</p> <p>Successful works of public art,<strong> </strong>especially monuments and memorials, often depend on community involvement in planning. Artists and architects should \u201csee themselves as resources, facilitators and collaborators\u201d, instead of imposing their visions on communities, <a href=\"https://www.pps.org/article/collaborative-creative-placemaking-good-public-art-depends-on-good-public-spaces\">wrote the national urban planning experts Cynthia Nikitin and Fred Kent.</a></p> <p>They added that widely used public art spaces often emphasize \u201cflexibility, changeability [and] evolution\u201d, seemingly speaking to the organic acts of reclamation that sprang up around the Lee monument. Poor examples of public art are \u201cstatic sculpture gardens\u201d as opposed to \u201cmulti-use public destinations\u201d, they continued.</p> <p>The VMFA has been praised as an obvious choice to lead artistic efforts on Monument Avenue, and the institution has stressed that it will involve community leaders, city residents, urban planners, historians and archivists.</p> <p>The VMFA also has the credibility of celebrating black legacy with artist <a href=\"https://www.vmfa.museum/about/rumors-of-war/\">Kenhinde Wiley\u2019s Rumors of War</a> and its exhibitions. Though Northam had asked for more than $10m to be granted to the VMFA for planning and initial construction on Monument Avenue, lawmakers reduced the amount to $1m over two years, and say they will return to the discussion when the museum presents a plan next September.</p> <p>But Allan-Charles Chipman, who ran for Richmond city council in 2020, and others say they fear that as a large institution, the VMFA won\u2019t be able to evoke the communal, multi-use and grassroots energy on Monument Avenue in 2020. And the museum should keep in mind that the graffiti on the plinths and other pieces were legitimate art, Chipman adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7173f39d7b24b5341f1c893b22c2cfba460b89ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7173f39d7b24b5341f1c893b22c2cfba460b89ca/0_72_2850_1710/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The image of the late congressman John Lewis is projected on the statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee in Richmond, Virginia, in July 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The image of the late congressman John Lewis is projected on the statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee in Richmond, Virginia, in July 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jay Paul/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI do not want to erase the reimagining that\u2019s already happened, because this would be a different conversation if the monuments and pedestals were clearly blank slates,\u201d he says. \u201cI would like to see the powers that be get behind, [and] really lead, support and amplify the art and the expressions that have already taken place there.\u201d</p> <p>The powers that be have already gotten it wrong, says Princess Blanding, the sister of Marcus David Peters, who is running for governor as an independent. Blanding criticizes the Library of Virginia for collecting and temporarily storing the items people left around the monument, just before the statue came down. The library is awaiting instructions from the Virginia department of general services on next steps.</p> <p>While the institution has been praised for protecting the works, Blanding and others say that the community should have been consulted on the future of these memorials to black lives, and have concerns about how they will be kept and honored.</p> <p>\u201cWhile people were celebrating and prepping for this big hurrah, for this symbolic gesture [the Lee removal], they literally had people there collecting these memorials,\u201d Blanding says. \u201cIt hurts on a deep level because even though it was named for my brother, that was a space for grieving families.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0198185de8bfa1f988f245534e251e8269091112\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0198185de8bfa1f988f245534e251e8269091112/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert E Lee Statue, Richmond, USA - 30 Aug 2020Mandatory Credit: Photo by Chris Tuite/ImageSPACE/REX/Shutterstock (10760454as) General View of the Robert E Lee Statue and surrounding area on August 30, 2020 in Richmond, Virginia.

Northam also proposed dedicating $9m toward memorializing the burial ground and jail sites, which are marked by few signs and small memorials, despite a history of national significance.</p> <p>What is clear is that the world \u201cshould hold Virginia to the fire on how we tell our history\u201d, Higgs Wise says. \u201cAnd how we fund it, to be very honest.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The fastest man in history is pondering just how much more destructive he could have been in the super spikes that have swung a wrecking ball at so many world records. Briefly, there is a battle between Usain Bolt the diplomat and Usain Bolt the competitor. The competitor wins. \u201cMe and a friend were talking about this the other day,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018should I be upset?\u2019 Because I know over the years everyone has tried to make spikes different and better but \u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>Bolt stresses he is not worried about the current crop shredding his 100m world record of 9.58sec or his 200m best of 19.19sec. Yet he sounds uneasy about where the arms race in shoe technology will lead. \u201cHow can I argue if World Athletics decide that it\u2019s legal? I can\u2019t do anything about it. The rules are the rules. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be fully happy, but it\u2019s just one of those things.\u201d</p> \n<p>He wants to make one thing absolutely clear: he would have gone a whole lot faster in the new wave of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/feb/22/super-spikes-seismic-shift-athletics-track-nike-air-zoom-victory-tokyo-olympics\" title=\"\">super spikes</a> \u2013 which feature a superlight, energy-returning foam and are said to be worth at least a tenth of a second over 100m. He is just not sure by how much. \u201cWe have guessed and we have talked about it, but I don\u2019t know for sure,\u201d he says. \u201cBut definitely much faster. Below 9.5 seconds for sure. Without a doubt.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/aug/03/usain-bolts-talent-for-speed-becomes-more-apparent-now-it-is-denied-to-us\">Usain Bolt's talent for speed becomes more apparent now it is denied to us | Jonathan Liew</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is a punchy statement, but the greatest and most popular athlete of his generation is only just getting started. When asked about Britain\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/20/adam-gemili-warns-ioc-tokyo-olympics-taking-knee-ban\" title=\"\">Adam Gemili\u2019s pledge to take a knee</a> on the podium at the Olympics in support of Black Lives Matter he doesn\u2019t procrastinate or play the politician. \u201cIf you believe in something, then you should do it. It\u2019s something that we need to make the world aware of, what\u2019s going on with racism.\u201d</p> \n<p>While the International Olympic Committee recently reiterated that protests on the field of play and the podium are banned Bolt suggests they are swimming against the tide. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it big in football now. If a track athlete decides to do it, they should be able to voice their opinion.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is rare for Bolt to grant an exclusive interview with a British newspaper and rarer still to hear him so reflective on so many subjects, including fame and falling short. Such sentiments are not usually associated with someone who won 134 of his 146 races between 2008 and 2017, winning eight Olympic gold medals and 11 world titles along the way. But when Bolt looks back at his career he believes he was capable of winning 200m gold at the 2004 Athens Olympics, when he was 17.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"93980f61dcafeaf2bcc1151a39f7fd72fad3eaf4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93980f61dcafeaf2bcc1151a39f7fd72fad3eaf4/0_130_5906_3545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Usain Bolt in 800m training: \u2018I have no regrets.

He believes people forget that, as a 16-year-old, he ran 20.13sec to finish 2003 ranked ninth in the world. But after moving to Kingston, and discovering Burger King and nightclubs, he did not always want to train. That, and a subsequent injury, meant he didn\u2019t emerge out of the heats in Athens.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn 2003 I was running faster than almost everybody,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I had run in the world championships that year I would have probably medalled. And if I\u2019d continued on that road, I would have run 19 seconds earlier in my career, so for sure I could have won gold in Athens if I\u2019d dedicated myself more.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cBut it was tough for me because even in high school I was famous. Everyone knew who I was in Jamaica. And I didn\u2019t have somebody who had already been through it to say: \u2018You have to take this seriously, because this is what you could do.\u2019 It was just my coach telling me to train hard.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I try to talk to the younger athletes now and explain to them \u2018get serious early man\u2019. Because the possibilities are endless.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The women\u2019s finals will be without a doubt more interesting. I think the women have led the way for a few years now</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>There is a second confession. After Bolt\u2019s career ended with him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/13/greatness-usain-bolt-burnished-injury-final-appearance\" title=\"\">tumbling to the track</a> after tearing his hamstring during the 2017 world championships in London, he was twice tempted to make a comeback. \u201cIt was something I thought about in the first and second year after I retired,\u201d he says. \u201cI even went to my coach. But he was like, \u2018It\u2019s going to be harder than before \u2013 coming back is not going to be a cakewalk.\u2019 </p> \n<p>\u201cWhen I look back I have no regrets. I did extremely well in my career. True, it didn\u2019t end on the greatest note but the legacy I left is wonderful.\u201d</p> \n<p>For years Bolt has been asked whether he will run again. Until now the answer has always been no. But on 13 July he will return to the track over 800m, a distance he has never run professionally, in a promotion for the US firm CarMax. The challenge, which will be streamed live on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/usainbolt\" title=\"\">Bolt\u2019s Facebook page</a>, is lighthearted \u2013 can he do two laps of his home track in Kingston quicker than a CarMax customer receives a live <a href=\"https://www.carmax.com/usainly-fast-offers\">online appraisal offer</a>, a process that typically takes under two minutes? \u2013 but he says he is taking it seriously.</p> \n<p>\u201cI train every day of the week. I still do a lot of cardio. And I\u2019m on my Peleton too. Now I just need to sharpen up at the track and get my lung capacity up.\u201d</p> \n<p>You do look in shape, I say. He laughs. \u201cI have tried to stay fit because my friends told me that when I retired I would get fat and I was like \u2018no way\u2019. So I can\u2019t let myself go when they have bet me it will happen in the next six to eight years. For me, it\u2019s a pride thing. I\u2019m not going to let them win. I\u2019m not going to give them the satisfaction.\u201d</p> \n<p>So how fast could he run 800m? \u201cMy personal best is around 2:05, but when I put my spikes on I reckon I can take five seconds off.\u201d</p> \n<p>Given he is only 34, could he yet be tempted to race properly again? \u201cNo, no, definitely not. This is just a challenge. Even now, I need something to challenge myself.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da7992f807280616ebad1d1ecbc50d9dd4b9714a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da7992f807280616ebad1d1ecbc50d9dd4b9714a/0_458_1239_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Usain Bolt and Kasi Bennett\" width=\"1000\" height=\"872\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Usain Bolt and his partner Kasi Bennett after announcing the birth of their twins, Saint Leo Bolt and Thunder Bolt.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For the past three Olympics, Bolt has been the closest thing sport has had to a religious experience. Even the mere mention of his name would create a wall of sound at the stadiums in Beijing, London and Rio, while his familiar burst of unanswerable speed and joy somehow always seemed to make jaws drop and smile at the same time. Bolt acknowledges that Tokyo will be a very different and difficult experience for athletes trapped in the bubble, as well as the few spectators permitted. But he believes a combination of a fast track and hot conditions will lead to spectacular performances.</p> \n<p>Unsurprisingly, it is the 100m and 200m that excites him the most, but his answer comes with a twist. \u201cThe women\u2019s finals will be without a doubt more interesting,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m looking forward to the most. The women have really stepped up and they\u2019ve led the way for a few years now.\u201d</p> \n<p>He talks about the protagonists with a coach\u2019s eye, noting how the Jamaican favourite Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce has changed her stride pattern to make herself faster and how Britain\u2019s Dina Asher-Smith looks far stronger than when she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/02/dina-asher-smith-wins-world-200m-golg-world-athletics-championships\" title=\"\">won 200m gold</a> at the 2019 world championships.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/jun/30/gabby-thomas-offers-latest-hint-womens-sprint-records-may-finally-fall\">Gabby Thomas offers latest hint women\u2019s sprint records may finally fall | Andy Bull</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cDina has already proven herself to be one of top athletes in the world,\u201d Bolt says. \u201cBut she keeps pushing to be the best and to beat the best. You see she puts in the work. She has the dedication. If a conversation is happening about who is going to win Olympic gold, she\u2019s a part of it.\u201d</p> \n<p>But when asked who he would put his money on for the 100m, he opts for his compatriot. \u201cShelly\u2011Ann has the edge because of her experience, as long as she just doesn\u2019t put too much pressure on herself. But Dina is her closest challenger.\u201d</p> \n<p>Before Covid struck, Bolt had intended to go to Tokyo as a fan, watching as many sports as possible \u2013 with fencing particularly on his bucket list. Instead, he will be in Kingston, watching while playing with his three children, Olympia Lightning Bolt, who turned one in May, and two-month-old twins Thunder Bolt and Saint Leo Bolt. He would love them to go into sports but says that a fourth child, which could create an unbeatable mixed 4x400m relay team, is not going to happen.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you\u2019re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>When asked what parenthood has taught him most, Bolt instantly replies \u201cpatience\u201d. That could turn out to be good news for track and field. For while most of his current attention is on a fledgling music career, he hints he may yet have unfinished business with the sport he dominated for so long.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the past my biggest problem was being patient with athletes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when you have kids you have to be a lot more patient. That has made me think about coaching. I have sat with my coach and started picking his brain about different things \u2013 how he writes his programme and stuff like that \u2013 so you never know. Maybe in the future I will take on the challenge. Let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Police brutality in Nigeria has sparked huge national protests. There should be international outrage too<br></p>",
     "body": "<p>Last Sunday, wearing a face shield, a protective mask and a waist-pouch full of hand sanitiser, I stood in front of the Nigerian high commission in London with hundreds of fellow Nigerians. We held up placards, raised our fists and chanted: \u201cEnd Sars,\u201d over and over again.</p> \n<p>The cry had first begun in Nigeria, when a video emerged of special anti-robbery squad (Sars) police officers shooting a man on the streets of Lagos. Though the date of the video is unknown, as is the name of the victim, Nigerians are no strangers to police brutality. It has either happened to you, or to someone you know. The police are not<em> </em>your friends, we often joke, with our special blend of black humour.</p> \n<p>And yet somehow, something was different this time. Musicians like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iRuntown/status/1312740945612484615\">Runtown</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/falzthebahdguy?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Falz</a> tweeted about a protest. The next day, the streets were full of young people chanting \u201cEnd Sars\u201d. Almost everyone had a story about being assaulted by a Sars officer, of being extorted, sexually harassed, or wrongfully detained.</p> \n<p>Soon, US celebrities such as P Diddy, Trey Songz and Viola Davis had picked up the hashtag and were tweeting their support. In the UK, actor John Boyega, who is of Nigerian descent, also used his social media page to support the protests. What these stars realised, before most of the western media did, was that this was another iteration of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> \n<p>Nigerian police officers are black, you may say. How can this be a BLM issue? Well, imagine New Zealand police officers shooting, maiming and killing unarmed white citizens because they were well dressed, because they had flashy phones, because they worked in the tech industry and therefore assumed they must be involved in fraud (all reasons used by Sars). Imagine if there were video footage of all these atrocities happening in leafy Christchurch. There would be global outrage. International sanctions. World leaders rushing to condemn these acts.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"876d904a-766b-4590-b9bd-a5f9f79d5ffd\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0MwlFIPy0OI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet the world seems curiously indifferent when the victims are black. Part of the reason African leaders get away with atrocities on African soil is because they know the world will turn a blind eye to them. Murderous despots will still be granted visas to Paris, London and New York. They will spend their loot on property and gaudy Rolexes, propping up foreign economies instead of building their own.</p> \n<p>The Black Lives Matter movement began because the deaths of innocent African American men and women were ignored, in the same way the deaths of young Nigerians at the hands of Sars have been ignored.</p> \n<p>Black lives matter everywhere that black lives are found: be it on the streets of the US, in rubber dinghies on the Mediterranean Sea, or in the towns and cities of Nigeria. Nigerians cried over the killing of George Floyd. And we hope in America, in Brazil, in Britain, in France, in China, in India, the African diaspora will also stand with us as we mourn the protester <a href=\"https://www.channelstv.com/2020/10/10/endsars-protester-jimoh-isiaq-killed-in-ogbomosho-seven-others-injured/\">Jimoh Isiaq</a>, who was shot last Saturday, and others killed by Sars.</p> \n<p>When one of us hurts, we all hurt. When one of us wins, we all win. This was the Pan-African dream of Marcus Garvey, of WEB Du Bois, of Constance Agatha Cummings-John, of Edward Wilmot Blyden, of Abdias do Nascimento, of Kwame Nkrumah and of many others.</p> \n<p>The protests continue daily in Nigeria. There will also be <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CGX4FvfB5Y5/\">one in London</a> on Sunday. The government has promised to dissolve the Sars unit and replace it with a Swat team, but many people feel it\u2019s just renaming rather than resolving the problem. The mistrust is warranted. The Nigerian government has promised to disband Sars before. Protesters continue to ask for tangible steps, such as the release of all detained protesters and the setting up of an independent body to investigate police misconduct.</p> \n<p>Already, heroes have emerged. The Feminist Coalition has raised millions of naira for protesters\u2019 legal and health bills. The podcaster FK Abudu and a host of Nigerian lawyers, such as Moe Odele and Tola Onayemi, are coordinating the release of protesters who have been wrongfully detained. Young Nigerians have marched in the sun and in the rain, and have done so peacefully, picking up their litter at the end of each day.</p> \n<p>Yet there are no leaders in the #EndSARS movement: as protesters reiterate, this is an organic, spontaneous eruption of the will of a young Nigerian population. No one knows what the movement will lead to. Some say it is a Nigerian version of the Arab spring. I say, we don\u2019t want a spring. Spring is a brief season that passes away. We want a new Nigeria that will last for generations.</p> \n<p>What can people in the rest of the world do? If you engage with Nigerian culture, if you dance to Afrobeats stars like Wizkid and Burna Boy, if you eat jollof rice and watch Nollywood movies on Netflix, then please show your support for #EndSARS. Black lives matter everywhere that black lives are found.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Chibundu Onuzo is author of The Spider King\u2019s Daughter and Welcome to Lagos</p>"

Experts point to several possible explanations, including bias from judges and other officials, and young people of color being detained for more serious offenses and having fewer resources and alternatives to incarceration in their communities.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fitting that in 2020, the year that juxtaposed Covid and racial justice protests, we saw this shrinking of the system \u2013 but also a resistance to doing so for young Black people,\u201d said Patricia Soung, a juvenile attorney and former director of youth justice policy for the Children\u2019s Defense Fund in California.</p> \n  <p><strong>By May 2020, detention centers were releasing white youths at a 17% higher rate than Black youths</strong>, according to a monthly <a href=\"https://www.aecf.org/blog/survey-amid-pandemic-youth-detention-population-fell-24-in-one-month-matchi/\">survey of juvenile justice agencies</a> in more than 30 states conducted by the Annie E Casey Foundation.</p> \n  <p>And in the months since, while the number of white youths has remained historically low, the number of Black and Latino youths has risen slightly, said Tom Woods, a senior associate and juvenile justice data analyst for the Casey Foundation.</p> \n  <p>The racial gap in detention is worsening even though teens, including those of color, were arrested less often in 2020, data shows. Police have generally taken a more hands-off approach due to the virus and, because classes have gone virtual, young people have interacted less with school-based officers.</p> \n  <p><strong>Read more of Eli Hager\u2019s report here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/08/us-juvenile-detention-race-marshall-project\">Racial inequality in US youth detention wider than ever, experts say</a></strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/08/us-juvenile-detention-race-marshall-project\">Racial inequality in US youth detention wider than ever, experts say</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60460ca48f08168521f5f61e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-08T11:39:14.433Z\">11.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A quick foreign snap here from Reuters. <strong>The US mission in Saudi Arabia has condemned drone and missile attacks launched by Yemen\u2019s Houthi movement</strong> on Saudi Arabia on Sunday, including at a facility vital to petroleum exports.</p> \n  <p>The mission, in an Arabic-language post on Twitter on Monday, said \u201cthe heinous Houthi assaults on civilians and vital infrastructure\u201d demonstrated lack of respect for human life and disregard for peace efforts.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/USAinKSA/status/1368880406511165440\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">\u062a\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u062c\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0648\u062b\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0629. \u062a\u064f\u0638\u0647\u0631 \u0627\u0639\u062a\u062f\u0627\u0621\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0648\u062b\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0646\u064a\u0639\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0646\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u062a\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u062d\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0647\u0645 \u0644\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0639\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0647\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645\u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u064a \u0644\u062a\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645. <a href=\"https://t.co/fMSMAAgJ84\">pic.twitter.com/fMSMAAgJ84</a></p>\u2014 U.S. Mission to KSA (@USAinKSA) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USAinKSA/status/1368880406511165440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 8, 2021</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-60460a8e8f08a73fb523806d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-08T11:37:33.402Z\">11.37am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Jury selection for Derek Chauvin trial over death of George Floyd expected to last three weeks</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The process of the trial for the killing of George Floyd will start with jury selection</strong>. It could be a lengthy process, writes Amy Forliti of the Associated Press. Twelve Hennepin County residents will be picked after an extensive grilling about their views on police and the justice system.</p> \n  <p><strong>Derek Chauvin</strong> is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd\u2019s death. <strong>Picking a jury is expected to take at least three weeks</strong>, as prosecutors and defense attorneys try to weed out people who may be biased against them.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want jurors who are completely blank slates, because that would mean they\u2019re not in tune at all with the world,\u201d Susan Gaertner, a former prosecutor, said. \u201cBut what you want is jurors who can set aside opinions that have formed prior to walking into the courtroom and give both sides a fair hearing.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Floyd was killed last year after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck for about nine minutes. His death sparked Black Lives Matter protests in Minneapolis and beyond, and led to a nationwide reckoning on race. Chauvin and three other officers were fired; the others face an August trial on aiding and abetting charges.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a97556f27367ab3168e6781fb95f63cbd0184fac\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a97556f27367ab3168e6781fb95f63cbd0184fac/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The George Floyd Memorial is seen in September last year, outside of Cup Foods located at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The George Floyd Memorial is seen in September last year, outside of Cup Foods located at 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amy Harris/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Chauvin\u2019s attorney, Eric Nelson, argued that pretrial publicity of the case and the subsequent violent unrest in Minneapolis would make it impossible to find an impartial jury in Hennepin County. But Judge Peter Cahill said last year that moving the trial probably wouldn\u2019t cure the problem of a potentially tainted jury pool because \u201cno corner of the State of Minnesota\u201d has been shielded from pretrial publicity.<br></p> \n  <p>The potential jurors were sent questionnaires to determine how much they have heard about the case and whether they\u2019ve formed any opinions. Besides biographical and demographic information, jurors were asked about prior contacts with police, whether they have protested against police brutality and whether they believe the justice system is fair. Some of the questions get very specific, such as how often a potential juror has watched the bystander video of Floyd\u2019s arrest, or whether they carried a sign at a protest and what that sign said.</p> \n  <p>Unlike typical jury selection proceedings, this jury pool will be questioned one by one instead of in a group. The judge, defense attorney and prosecutors will all get to ask questions. The defense can object to up to 15 potential jurors without giving a reason; prosecutors can block up to nine with no reason given. Both sides can also argue to dismiss an unlimited number of jurors \u201cfor cause,\u201d meaning they must provide a reason why they believe that juror shouldn\u2019t serve. </p> \n  <p>Even if a juror says they have had a negative interaction with the police, or a negative opinion about Black Lives Matter, the key will be trying to find out whether they can put those past experiences or opinions aside and be fair.</p> \n  <p>Opening arguments are not expected until 29 March at the earliest.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-604606748f08a73fb5238041\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-03-08T11:16:30.124Z\">11.16am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Darryl Fears and Jared Goyette are covering the developments in the trial of Derek Chauvin for the Washington Post, and here\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/a-silent-march-and-symbolic-coffin-on-the-eve-of-the-trial-for-george-floyds-death/2021/03/07/8331b4aa-7f66-11eb-9ca6-54e187ee4939_story.html\">how they reported</a> yesterday\u2019s silent protest in Minneapolis.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A Sunday afternoon march drew a few thousand people to the Hennepin County Government Center, which these days is encircled by concrete barriers and multiple layers of security fencing.

Under his leadership, the Spurs organization became the league standard for professionalism, respectability and doing things the \u201cright way\u201d, a reputation that rubbed off on San Antonio greats like David Robinson, Manu Ginobli, Kawhi Leonard, Tony Parker, Avery Johnson, Sean Elliott, LaMarcus Aldridge, Patty Mills, DeMar DeRozan, Rudy Gay and countless others.</p> <p>But what makes Coach Popovich really special, as well as unique, is the way he used his voice and his platform to speak out on injustice, racism, police brutality and the rest of societal ills that plague American society, not only on a daily, personal basis, but a systemic basis. As a white man, in the state of Texas of all places, this not only requires a lot of courage but commands a lot of respect.</p> <p>Pop had a knack for utilizing NBA press conferences and post-game interviews to express his thoughts and opinions on various topics, often without prompting or provocation. </p> <p>After George Floyd was murdered, Coach Popovich\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/06/gregg-popovich-nba-san-antonio-spurs-racism-george-floyd?src=rss\">heartfelt address</a> said what a lot of people needed to hear.</p> <p>\u201cIn a strange, counterintuitive sort of way, the best teaching moment of this recent tragedy, I think, was the look on the officer\u2019s face, [during Floyd\u2019s death]. For white people to see how nonchalant, how casual, just how everyday-going-about-his job, so much so that he could just put his left hand in his pocket, wriggle his knee around a little bit to teach this person some sort of a lesson \u2013 and that it was his right and his duty to do it, in his mind.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019m just embarrassed as a white person to know that that can happen. To actually watch a lynching. We\u2019ve all seen books, and you look in the books and you see black people hanging off of trees. And you...are amazed. But we just saw it again. I never thought I\u2019d see that, with my own eyes, in real-time.\u201d</p> <p>In 2017, Popovich spoke at length at Spurs media day about systemic racism and politics, saying the country under <a href=\"https://www.ksat.com/news/2017/09/25/watch-popovich-blasts-president-trump-says-our-country-is-embarrassment-to-world/\">Trump had become \u201can embarrassment to the world</a>\u201d: \u201cObviously, race is the elephant in the room and we all understand that. Unless it is talked about constantly, it\u2019s not going to get better. Why do we have to talk about that?\u2019 Well, because it\u2019s uncomfortable. There has to be an uncomfortable element in the discourse for anything to change.</p> <p>\u201cThe disgusting tenure and tone and all the comments \u2026 have been xenophobic, homophobic, racist, misogynistic. I live in a country where half the people ignored that to elect someone.\u201d</p> <p>Asked to <a href=\"https://www.ksat.com/sports/2020/01/20/popovich-reflects-on-legacy-of-mlk-fears-roll-back-of-race-situation-in-country/\">reflect on the life of Dr Martin Luther King Jr</a> and race relations in the country, part of Popovich\u2019s answer focused on the country\u2019s leadership.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems like a lot of roll back in that regard, especially as we look at the race situation in our country. Everybody wants to forget about it but it should be there, front and center, constantly,\u201d Popovich said.</p> <p>\u201cRace is still the unanswered dilemma that everyone continues to ignore. Dr. King did not ignore it, and it\u2019s a big fear now that we have a group in power that is very willing to ignore it. It\u2019s not just with their words, but their actions prove it, and that is scary.\u201d</p> <p>Now. Coach Popovich wasn\u2019t the first and definitely won\u2019t be the last in sports to verbally spank the former US president or call out the blatant and the prevailing racism and bigotry that is currently running rampant not only throughout the Republican Party but America as a whole, yet he\u2019s certainly one of the most important and unique for a number of reasons:</p> <p><strong>1)</strong> Coach Popovich is a graduate of the Air Force Academy and works in a military town.</p> <p><strong>2)</strong> The aforementioned standard that he and the Spurs organization has set would appear to be in direct opposition to his public chastisement of the America.</p> <p><strong>3)</strong> Coach Popovich was making these statements in the ultra-red state of Texas, arguably the most conservative of the conservative states based on the state legislature and the congressional delegation, one that has voted Republican in 10 straight presidential elections and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/mapdata-2016/2016-election/results/map/president/\">saw 52.6% of voters punch for Trump</a>.</p> <p>For my book <a href=\"http://www.akashicbooks.com/catalog/police-brutality-and-white-supremacy-the-fight-against-american-traditions/\">Police Brutality and White Supremacy: The Fight Against American Traditions</a>, I interviewed former NBA player Rex Chapman, who is white. He spoke to the power of white people in particular speaking out on injustice.</p> <p>\u201cA big part of it makes me sad that we have to have white people speaking out in order for it to resonate with a lot of white America,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cIt hurts my heart when I see my friends Steve Kerr, Steve Nash, Stan Van Gundy, Greg Popovich picking their spots, because they\u2019re still in the NBA. I know the tightrope they do have to walk on some issues, but some of the stuff they\u2019ve said Black people have been saying for decades. I\u2019m proud of them for saying it now Proud to call them my friends. I\u2019m proud to be of the group of white people who genuinely want to be allies in this fight.\u201d</p> <p>The reality is, there are segments of people in America who will give one big collective eye roll to hearing any Black person talk about systemic racism, police brutality, white supremacy, and bigotry. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s LeBron James, Colin Kaepernick, Barack Obama or anyone else. But they will hear it from someone like Coach Popovich. They will think about it. Reflect on it. And not be immediately offended or dismiss that he is \u2018playing the race card\u2019.</p> <p>Coach Popovich said that it\u2019s up to white people to call out racism no matter what the consequences and didn\u2019t even really receive any backlash for his comments, not even in an ultra-conservative place like Texas. And that\u2019s what makes him unique and special. Yes, Popovich\u2019s coaching milestone is historic and worthy of celebration, but his activism off the court will endure longer as the standard for all white people who truly want to be allies in this fight against racism and white supremacy.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>The march she led in 1981 helped forge a black British identity. She talks about revolution, police brutality and Black Lives Matter</p>",
     "body": "<p>On Monday 2 March 1981, Leila Hassan Howe led a 20,000-person march through the streets of London. It was designed, she said, to \u201ccause maximum disruption\u201d and so, for eight hours, on a working day, the protesters marched; when they stopped the traffic on Blackfriars Bridge the police were so angry they tried to end it there. When they continued down Fleet Street \u2013 then synonymous with the British media \u2013 Hassan Howe says that \u201cpeople were throwing banana skins at us\u201d. Yet neither the police nor overt racism in the home of the press could stop them.</p> <p>The protest that Hassan Howe helped organise \u2013 with her partner, the journalist, activist and publisher Darcus Howe \u2013 was dubbed the National Black People\u2019s Day of Action. And it was unlike anything seen in Britain before. Today it is considered to be a turning point in black British identity.</p> <p>The poet Linton Kwesi Johnson would later talk of the \u201csense of power\u201d and optimism the march gave him, while for the playwright Kwame Kwei-Armah watching the event on TV \u201cwas my first experience of us, as a black community, standing up \u2026 This was black Britain.\u201d The publisher <a href=\"https://www.blackhistorymonth.org.uk/article/gallery/test-diane-julie-abbott-politician/\">Eric Huntley</a>, who, with his late wife Jessica, founded the publishers Bogle-L\u2019Ouverture, was so moved he told Hassan Howe he had previously \u201calways intended to go back to Guyana. But after the day of action, that was over.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bea2975f2e79100ab52b87031de9dad3f14eff4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bea2975f2e79100ab52b87031de9dad3f14eff4/0_0_4295_2847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The National Black People\u2019s Day of Action near Hyde Park on 2 March 1981.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The National Black People\u2019s Day of Action near Hyde Park on 2 March 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hassan Howe had helped arrange the march in response to the deaths of 13 young black people who had been trapped in a house fire in New Cross, south-east London, six weeks earlier. The blaze started during a birthday party for the 16-year-old Yvonne Ruddock, and she was among those who died that night.<strong> </strong>Many people suspected that the fire was the result of a racist arson attack; the area was notorious for far-right violence (<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/new-cross-fire-black-peoples-day-of-action_uk_5e582608c5b6450a30bc0ac3\">three years earlier</a> the local Moonshot club had been firebombed, and the National Front was implicated). But rather than seriously investigating the suspicion of racist violence, the police were said to be rounding up young black people and trying to get them to confess. Meanwhile the media and government were silent. \u201cThirteen dead, nothing said\u201d was the chant shouted by protesters highlighting this indifference to the loss of black lives. The march, then, was a response to the urgent need to take a stand and transform a Britain in which, for years, the black community had felt under attack.</p> <p>Hassan Howe says she realised how pivotal the moment could be at the very first meeting called at the Moonshot to discuss the response to the fire. She expected 50 people to turn up; more than 300 arrived. \u201cThere was a lot of anger, people saying \u2018enough is enough\u2019,\u201d she recalls. In 1981 there was \u201ca political consciousness, a militancy in the community and we had to take a stand\u201d. Looking back it is no surprise that, just a month later, a full-scale revolt took place in Brixton, south London, in the form of the 1981 uprisings.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In preparation for the journey, her father said: 'Everything you\u2019ve been taught about Africa and Africans isn\u2019t true'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Black power, a global grassroots movement to restore pride in being black, had begun to mobilise for change. In the UK this translated into a \u201cself-help\u201d movement for black communities, aiming to bring them together to challenge racism and its impact, while demanding justice from the state. Black power organisations such as the Black Parents Movement, Black Youth Movement and Race Today Collective spent months holding meetings and travelling around the country before the national demonstration. \u201cBlack British identity was forged in black power,\u201d says Hassan Howe.</p> <p>She was born in London in 1948 to a working-class English mother and a father from Zanzibar (now part of Tanzania) who worked as a halal butcher; her parents met before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/16/windrush-scandal-the-long-betrayal-archived-documents-david-olusoga\">Empire Windrush</a> even docked. Most of her mother\u2019s family had never met a black person before, and on hearing the news that she was dating Ramadhan Hassan, Hassan Howe\u2019s aunt asked her mother, Lilian Ivy Watson: \u201cOh Lily, what have you gone and done?\u201d He had come to Britain as a seaman and had strong ties to the east African community. Although her mother didn\u2019t like it, their home was a \u201chaven for anyone from east Africa\u201d arriving in London and people would turn up \u201cany time of day or night\u201d, says Hassan Howe.</p> <p>Ramadhan Hassan was a devout Muslim who ensured his daughter was brought up in the faith. When she was 10, her parents divorced and her father was granted custody. He decided to take his daughter to live in Zanzibar, partly to educate her about the continent. Hassan Howe was initially devastated about moving to Africa and was in floods of tears at the thought of being separated from her mother.</p> <p>In preparation for the journey, her father told her: \u201cEverything you\u2019ve been taught about Africa and Africans isn\u2019t true.\u201d They travelled through Egypt \u2013 taking a riverboat down the Nile \u2013 Sudan and Kenya, staying with families her father had supported in London. In Zanzibar a wealthy Arab family offered to have Hassan Howe come to live with them, to \u201craise her in Islam\u201d, and she went to live with the Souds and their five children. It was a privileged life: her father would visit, and Hassan Howe was happy until revolution struck the island in 1964.</p> <p>Zanzibar gained independence from the British empire in December 1963 and Hassan Howe remembers the celebrations when the British left. But the Soud household was part of the wealthy Arab elite that the British had empowered at the expense of the African population, and, when the sultan was overthrown in January 1964, they moved in with relatives for safety.</p> <p>\u201cOne day two men with guns came to the house and asked for me,\u201d says Hassan Howe. \u201cEverybody thought that was the end, and we were all praying.\u201d She was taken to the Revolutionary Council, who met in a stadium in the capital. Once there she was handed a telegram \u2013 it was from her mother telling her to \u201cget on the last plane that leaves Zanzibar\u201d. The Foreign Office had refused to evacuate Hassan Howe because she was a Zanzibar national but had agreed to ensure her safe passage if her family could pay for a flight.</p> <p>She returned to London to live with her mother and stepfather. But the England she came back to in 1964 was different to the one she had left. Mass immigration dominated the political scene, and hostility toward the black population was rife. At Plaistow Grammar school, she was one of only three black girls. \u201cIt was just horrendous. My life was just made hell. We\u2019d just be sitting there and you\u2019d get a tirade from other students against immigrants and against immigration. No one would play with us in the playground. It was a very isolated and lonely existence.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was unbelievable: we\u2019d leave our house and when you\u2019d hit Railton Road the police would stop you</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Home was no better: her white stepfather had \u201cvery racial views\u201d and black people were not allowed into her parents\u2019 working men\u2019s club. \u201cPeople were born in east London, worked in east London and died in east London,\u201d she says. Her time abroad meant, even if she wanted to, she \u201ccould not become a half-white, half-black East End girl, trying to accommodate a lot of the racism\u201d.</p> <p>Instead, reading became her salvation. Particularly the work of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/15/the-fire-this-time-legacy-of-james-baldwin\">James Baldwin</a>. At 18 she wrote a telegram to the African American author, an \u201coutpouring of me talking about race and racism and that his book [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/04/james-baldwin-the-fire-next-time-steve-shapiro\">The Fire Next Time</a>] had given me hope and experiences I could relate to\u201d. She still vividly remembers the reply she received: \u201c\u2018Keep the faith\u2019, signed \u2018Jimmy\u2019\u201d. When Baldwin died, the magazine she was editing at the time, Race Today, organised a memorial in Brixton town hall in February 1988, headlined by Maya Angelou.</p> <p>The Daily Telegraph became the unlikely key to her life as an activist, thanks to an advert for a job at the Institute of Race Relations. In 1971, she started working with the influential writer and activist Ambalavaner Sivanandan in the library. The institute was, she says, a \u201ccolonial, academic institution\u201d at the time, but the library had copies of newspapers from global liberation movements including the American Black Panther, and the latest information on racism in Britain \u2013 so British black power activists were frequent visitors.</p> <p>In 1971, Hassan Howe joined the Black Unity and Freedom party (BUFP) to fight for racial justice, and to challenge the idea that black people were \u201cthird-class citizens\u201d. After joining she was expected to sell 100 copies of the organisation\u2019s newspaper. She also taught maths and English to children, part of the grassroots <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/12/racism-schools-government-reforms-targets\">black supplementary school movement</a> that taught black children when the state was failing to do so.</p> <p>The BUFP demonstrated against police brutality, immigration legislation and in solidarity with global movements. But with Sivanandan, Hassan Howe decided to take action closer to home \u2013 to overthrow the Institute of Race Relations board \u2013 including the Booker brothers, whose wealth came from Caribbean plantations, as well as patrons who had been enriched by British colonies in Africa. First they \u201cpacked the membership\u201d by signing up left-leaning members of the public, so by 1972 they had enough members to pass a motion at the AGM to sack the council. The takeover meant the institute\u2019s magazine, Race Today, could also take an altogether more radical turn \u2013 hiring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/03/darcus-howe-obituary\">Darcus Howe</a> as editor in 1973.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce69e4f798412495c341084360ef7a6dea8e4921\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce69e4f798412495c341084360ef7a6dea8e4921/56_6_1128_1583/713.jpg\" alt=\"Race Today, February/March 1982 issue.\" width=\"713\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Race Today, February/March 1982 issue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Leila Hassan Howe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hassan Howe had first met Darcus in 1971 when he arrived at the library to do research. She next saw him at the interview for the editorship \u2013 which, \u201ctypically\u201d, she says, he only agreed to if he was offered the job in advance. The pair began a relationship in 1977 that was to last until Darcus Howe\u2019s death in 2017, marrying in 1989. Together they transformed Race Today into a beacon of black radical thought and practice. This began in the dead of night in August 1974. Hassan Howe, Darcus and other members of the staff loaded the equipment of the magazine into a post van \u2013 assisted by the British Black Panther Olive Morris. Then they drove to a squat in Brixton, where \u201cwe broke down the door, changed the locks and moved in\u201d.</p> <p>The move was to show how the magazine was now on the \u201cfront lines\u201d of Brixton to \u201crecord and recognise\u201d the struggles of the black working class. Darcus wanted to use the magazine to shift how society viewed black people \u201cfrom victims to protagonists. That we could shape our own history, we were not reliant on others, we could do it for ourselves\u201d. The pair were heavily influenced by the renowned intellectual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/02/beyond-a-boundary-broke-cricket-barriers\">CLR James</a>, Darcus Howe\u2019s uncle, who lived above the offices in Brixton, to use the power of a magazine to assist the burgeoning black power movement.</p> <p>Hassan Howe herself was deputy editor from 1973 and took over as editor in 1986. The magazine covered everything from politics to sport. I was educated by the black literature curated by the community and copies of Race Today were an essential part of this. Topics such as black nurses striking over pay conditions; Asian workers withdrawing their labour in Midlands factories; and the uprisings of black youth against the police were urgent to the community.</p> <p>The police were a persistent subject. Hassan Howe says the way \u201cthey policed us in colonial societies was the same way they policed here, which was with brute force\u201d. In 1981 the issue came to a head when the Metropolitan police force initiated Operation Swamp 81; in five days in April, they stopped and searched almost 1,000 people in Brixton. Hassan Howe says: \u201cIt was unbelievable: we\u2019d leave our house and when you\u2019d hit Railton Road they would stop you. Anybody going into Brixton. Old people, young people, people like me.\u201d Such tactics reminded her of apartheid-era South Africa \u2013 and the tension built for days. It erupted on 11 April, after a crowd wrongly believed that police were trying to arrest a stabbing victim, Michael Bailey. For two days the police lost control of Brixton as the youth rebelled against years of perceived abuse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/oct/01/paul-stephenson-the-hero-who-refused-to-leave-a-pub-and-helped-desegregate-britain\">Paul Stephenson: the hero who refused to leave a pub \u2013 and helped desegregate Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hassan Howe recalls that the rebellion was well organised.

Then the co-founder of Black Lives Matter (BLM) turns away from the webcam and starts to sob, hand to her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m crying because I was prepared for rightwing attacks. I wasn\u2019t prepared for Black people to attack me. And I think that\u2019s probably the hardest thing in this position, to lose your own people. The people that you love the most, the people that you do this work for. The human being feels betrayed, the leader feels like: \u2018Yeah, welcome to Black leadership. This is the fucking hazing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s almost 10 years since Cullors, 38, helped to launch what has been described as the largest global protest movement in history. In that time she has gone from local community organiser to international activism A-lister. But with celebrity has come controversy, including complaints about a lack of transparency about the huge sums of money that have flowed BLM\u2019s way. She has also been called a hypocrite for amassing a property portfolio inconsistent with her beliefs as a self-described \u201ctrained Marxist.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-01-13/patrisse-cullors-black-lives-matter\">She has called these attacks</a>: \u201cNot just a character assassination campaign, but a campaign to actually get me assassinated.\u201d</p> <p>She has had plenty of time to brood on all this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/27/black-lives-matter-cofounder-patrisse-cullors\">since she stepped down as executive director</a> of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation (BLMGNF) last May. But she has also written a book, An Abolitionist\u2019s Handbook: 12 Steps to Changing Yourself and the World. The central assumption is that the police cannot be reformed \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/07/us-cities-defund-police-transferring-money-community\">they must be defunded, disarmed, disbanded</a> and replaced by other systems of public safety.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been an abolitionist for 20 years, even before I started identifying as an abolitionist,\u201d Cullors says. \u201cWhat I hadn\u2019t seen was a more robust conversation about how we practise abolition. What does it mean when we say ending the police state, no more jails? What does that mean as an everyday practice? The values that are in that book. I practise them every day.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"112c393bbc5feb1e966667b8e34bd6997db94b52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/112c393bbc5feb1e966667b8e34bd6997db94b52/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstration in Baltimore in 2015 over the death of Freddie Gray.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstration in Baltimore in 2015 over the death of Freddie Gray.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Burton/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When we begin the first of our two chats on Zoom, it is early morning in her home town of LA, and she is cool and slightly formal, reluctant to turn on her camera. But she thaws quickly, chatting to me as she moves through the house she shares with her partner, the activist Janaya Khan, and her six-year-old son. The camera comes on, and she eases into herself, breaking off briefly to message a friend who is going through a bereavement, and joking with Khan about needing too much coffee to get through the day.</p> <p>She is not a naturally guarded person. \u201cI was one of the first people in my friends group to go to therapy,\u201d she says. \u201cI grew up with a father who was in 12-step AA. I\u2019ve sat in those rooms and heard grown men cry. I\u2019ve always seen vulnerability as the way towards transformation and healing, and that\u2019s difficult because we don\u2019t live in a world that cares for Black people\u2019s vulnerability.\u201d</p> <p>Vulnerability defined her 90s childhood and drove her to activism. \u201cSome of this is personality and some of this is nurturing,\u201d she says. The third of four siblings, she was raised by a mother who was preoccupied by working and paying the bills. The man she thought of as her father \u201cwasn\u2019t there a lot and was a big headache for my mother,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She grew up feeling different from her siblings, then discovered that she was \u2013 her biological father was someone her mother had known during a brief separation from her siblings\u2019 father. Cullors didn\u2019t meet this man until she was 12. She never refers to the man she grew up with as her stepfather, but as \u201cthe father that raised me.\u201d For all his faults, she says, \u201cwhen it comes to his children, his words of affirmation are words that keep me going still. He never made me feel different or apart.\u201d</p> <p>Still, meeting her biological father explained a lot. Until then, she says, she felt \u201cpretty much like an alien the whole time. I love my family and siblings, but I was nothing like them. They\u2019re all introverts. I was rambunctious, loud, extrovert \u2013 wild hair and wild clothes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"991f7187059fd5007ba8f9eb6f310c240d5232b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/991f7187059fd5007ba8f9eb6f310c240d5232b6/0_0_5662_3632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cullors speaks at a Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign rally in Los Angeles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"641\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cullors speaks at a Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign rally in Los Angeles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Tullberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her difference was further accentuated by her sexuality. Cullors came out as queer at 16, and was promptly kicked out by her mother \u2013 a woman who, according to Cullors, \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe in queerness and transness.\u201d \u201cWe have very different accounts of what happened when I came out as queer,\u201d Cullors says. \u201cMy account is that I was kicked out. Her account is: \u2018I never kicked you out.\u2019 I was pretty much houseless during my last two years of high school.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a straightforward falling-out, though. Cullors\u2019 mother still checked in on her \u201call the time.\u201d \u201cI was hurt but I have so much compassion for my mom because of everything she went through as a parent.\u201d</p> <p>Poverty and policing moulded the rest of her personality. \u201cIt felt like we were being hunted as kids,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember waking up in the middle of the night and hearing the helicopters and seeing them shining their light in our window.\u201d The light was trained on her brother Monte and his friends hanging out outside.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone talks about the war on drugs; we don\u2019t talk about the war on gangs,\u201d she says, recalling a time in the 90s when disproportionate resources were mobilised towards inner-city gang policing. Helicopter policing is \u201cfucking expensive,\u201d she says, and a sign that the campaign was \u201cessentially the federal government declaring a war on brown and Black children and calling them domestic terrorists. We were living in a literal war zone. That is the context that made me an abolitionist.\u201d</p> <p>Monte was arrested in 1999 at the age of 19, and spent six years in LA prisons, after which he emerged with stories of torture, beatings, starvation and bed-chaining. His family lost him within the prison complex, where he would be moved between jails without notification or explanation. When they asked to visit or speak to him, Cullors says, information about his whereabouts was withheld. \u201cThey would do this thing where they would beat the shit out of somebody, almost kill them, then they would hide them in the jails for months. So you couldn\u2019t get a hold of your loved one, because they didn\u2019t want any proof of what they did. My brother was tortured multiple times.\u201d</p> <p>Against this tumultuous backdrop, Cullors was labelled \u201cgifted\u201d at a young age, and sent to a school in a white, affluent area. Travelling between her poor, working-class life and her new school jolted Cullors into outrage. \u201cIn my adolescent brain I was like: \u2018OK, I\u2019m living in this neighbourhood, experiencing policing on a daily basis. And then I go to a completely different neighbourhood during the day for school with people who are living a completely different life \u2013 they have no understanding of the police state.\u2019 I have access to all these resources. I\u2019m also realising that you can live differently. People have access to grocery stores and green space and I don\u2019t. I was like: \u2018This is unacceptable. It is unacceptable that I come home to police sirens and helicopter policing and that I go to school, where all these white kids are doing every drug under the sun and nothing is happening to them. Why not them, when they\u2019re actually the ones dealing the drugs?\u2019 I\u2019m talking about massive amounts of drugs that I would not have had access to if it wasn\u2019t for white communities. That wasn\u2019t right.\u201d</p> <p>In her early teens, she began to read the works of the civil rights <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/04/your-silence-will-not-protect-you-by-audre-lorder-review\">activist Audre Lorde</a> and autobiographies of Black Panther members, coming to the conclusion that there was a golden age of civic rights activism in the 60s and 70s that she missed out on. When she was 16, she went to a social justice camp run by the National Conference for Community and Justice. \u201cIt changed my life.\u201d Two hundred young people from across LA county were there, being taught about civil rights, identity and how to challenge racism and patriarchy. In the camp, she was introduced to the first civil rights organisation that she was a part of, the Bus Riders Union, a movement that challenges discriminatory policies affecting the overwhelmingly low-income African American, Latino and Asian users of public transport in Los Angeles county. That introduction was \u201cthe pivotal moment\u201d, she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70fee44aa511359530e5e97bfc61b3a1946f0dfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70fee44aa511359530e5e97bfc61b3a1946f0dfb/0_0_3000_2116/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(From left) Alicia Garza, Cullors and Opal Tometi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"705\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BLM founders \u2026 (from left) Alicia Garza, Cullors and Opal Tometi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She ended up staying at the Bus Riders Union for 11 years. She learned how to take on the state, and began to leverage it for her first passion \u2013 fighting and reforming the police. It was in 2013, while she was transitioning to abolition work, that Cullors first tweeted the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, after George Zimmerman was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/zimmerman-acquitted-killing-trayvon-martin\">acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin</a> in Florida. Then came her call to action, alongside fellow activists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/17/black-lives-matter-alicia-garza-leadership-today-doesnt-look-like-martin-luther-king\">Alicia Garza</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/24/opal-tometi-co-founder-of-black-lives-matter-i-do-this-because-we-deserve-to-live\">Opal Tometi</a>. At first, she says, \u201cwe didn\u2019t feel like owners of it. We didn\u2019t call ourselves co-founders of BLM until like a year later. The only reason we started to call ourselves co-founders is because it started to be co-opted. It started to be Black men using BLM as a way to tell their message, which was largely anti-woman or often anti-queer and trans. Or devoid of the conversation of feminism. And we were like: \u2018We\u2019ve gotta intervene.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>By 2014, Black Lives Matter had local chapters across the US. \u201cWhat we did, Alicia, Opal and I, is create infrastructure <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/28/patrisse-khan-cullors-black-lives-matter-interview\">so that we could have language and a framework</a> around why police violence, vigilante violence, incarceration, were the greatest dangers to our community. We created a language around queerness and transness as not the enemy to Black people. My specific role was bringing people together, going across the country and world to talk about the tactic of protest, the tactic of what we call \u2018shutting shit down\u2019, of lifting up Blackness and being OK with saying: \u2018Black lives matter.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>But BLM had grown too quickly. \u201cAt a certain point,\u201d she says, \u201cpeople wanted to start giving us money and we didn\u2019t have a legal infrastructure and we weren\u2019t sure we wanted one.\u201d Then George Floyd died under the knee of a policeman in the summer of 2020, and donations skyrocketed. BLMGNF took in just over $90m (\u00a367m) that year.</p> <p>Cullors and other BLM leaders have since come under intense scrutiny, with claims that too little of the money raised has reached those in need, while large sums have circulated around an opaque network of companies, some of them with links to Cullors.</p> <p>She concedes today that her executive position did not match her skills. \u201cI was trained,\u201d she says, \u201cto take a moment and help build a campaign around it.\u201d The problems started afterwards. Not only is Cullors better at motivation than management, she is also prone to abstractions. \u201cI\u2019m really interested in the best and possible ways we can access joy, healing, beauty and transformation,\u201d she says, when I ask what drives her.</p> <p>We run out of time just as Cullors is about to get into the difficulties of her time at the helm of BLM and agree to chat again the day after. When we speak the next morning, she seems wearier, more deflated than the day before.</p> <p>She has been thinking about a recent article in New York magazine headlined: \u201c<a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/01/black-lives-matter-finances.html\">The BLM mystery: where did the money go?</a>\u201d. It noted that in November 2020, 10 chapters of the BLMGNF had called for greater financial accountability, complaining that there was \u201cno acceptable process of either public or internal transparency about the unknown millions of dollars donated to BLMGNF\u201d. The article went on to imply that Cullors had turned her back on high-risk protest and activism in favour of collaborations with corporate sponsors, and of questionable transactions between her other organisations and BLM, none of which has been proven.</p> <p>It did, however, concede: \u201cThe deals could have reasonable explanations.\u201d As for Cullors\u2019 property portfolio, the magazine said: \u201cThere is no evidence that Cullors used money sent to BLMGNF to purchase personal property.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked multiple jobs across many organisations my entire life,\u201d Cullors <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9468847/BLM-founder-defends-3MILLION-property-portfolio-claims-questions-tactic-terror.html\">previously stated</a>. \u201cI\u2019m also a published author, writer, producer, professor, public speaker and performance artist \u2026 I work hard to provide for my family.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>Cullors had been \u201ccrying to a girlfriend\u201d about the New York magazine story, she says now, before she starts crying with me too.</p> <p>Attempts at greater transparency in the two years before she left BLM failed, she admits. \u201cI think it\u2019s because Black people in general have a hard time with money. It\u2019s a trigger point for us.\u201d She also thinks that they didn\u2019t do \u201cthe best job of telling our story. A lot of that has to do with being socialised as a woman and just wanting to do the work, not bragging about what we\u2019ve done, what we\u2019ve accomplished. Which is, I want to say on record, a great error. I do want to make it really clear that millions of dollars were put back into the community.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3b44563b0ba43e0e5b4a56b153eb3af3c218db1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b44563b0ba43e0e5b4a56b153eb3af3c218db1c/0_0_3500_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I do want to make it really clear that millions of dollars were put back into the community.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I do want to make it really clear that millions of dollars were put back into the community.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Cheung/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And she still thinks she can make a contribution, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/30/abolitionists-still-have-work-to-do-in-america\">as she focuses on police abolition</a>. \u201cI was thrust into a global spotlight, but at the end of the day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/mar/24/patrisse-khan-cullors-activist-black-lives-matter-interview\">I\u2019m a local community organiser</a>. I can sustain local organising work. I think being the face of a global movement was turning me into something I didn\u2019t want to be. I didn\u2019t want to be a shark. I don\u2019t have the emotional bandwidth.\u201d She is also done with the internecine conflict between Black movements that she sees happening on social media. \u201cIf I were a young person watching, I\u2019d be like: \u2018Keep me away from that shit. That is drama and trauma. I have enough of that. Let me go be an influencer on TikTok.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Cullors seems constantly to be treading a fine line between humility and hurt, between letting go but also claiming what is due to her. \u201cYou\u2019re catching me at a place of deep, deep self-reflection,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I look forward to many more years ahead where I can look back with more fondness. I think right now I have a lot of hurt and resentment and I feel like I\u2019ve been treated as the fall guy for a movement that is much bigger than me. And some will say: \u2018Well you let yourself be Time 100, you let yourself be in the forefront and you\u2019re about to be on the cover of the Guardian \u2013 kinda comes with the territory.\u2019 True.\u201d</p> <p>But then comes a final plea: \u201cWe need to treat our leaders better.\u201d</p> <p><em>Patrisse Cullors will launch An Abolitionist Handbook</em><em> at <a href=\"https://thewowfoundation.com/festival/wow-london-22\">the WOW festival in London</a> on 11 March.

     "body": "<p>When George Floyd was in high school, his teacher Bertha Dinkins prophetically told the teen: \u201cI want to read about you in the newspaper\u2026 that you have made history and done something to change society\u201d. She could never have foretold that Floyd would become a household name because the world watched a video of police officer Derek Chauvin slowly choke him to death with his knee on his neck in 2020.</p> <p>The killing sparked the largest protests ever against racial injustice, prompting society to discuss racism in ways it has not done for more than a generation. <em>His Name </em><em>Is George Floyd</em> (written by two <em>Washington Post</em> reporters) attempts to use the life and death of Floyd as a vehicle to examine the bigotry that lies at the heart of the present-day US.</p> <p>Figures that spark protests are often barely drawn in two dimensions: we have a name, an image and little else. We know Emmett Till \u2013 whose lynching in 1955 is credited with sparking the civil rights movement after his mother displayed his disfigured body in an open casket \u2013 as a 14-year-old killed for supposedly whistling at a white woman. Trayvon Martin \u2013 whose killing by George Zimmerman in 2012 ignited the Black Lives Matter movement \u2013 is the teenager in a hoodie who died for going to a shop to buy Skittles.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The authors make a valiant effort to use Floyd\u2019s story to educate society about the ills of structural racism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In this age of misinformation, where the victims of police killings are made out to be the problem, this humanising of Floyd is necessary. The book does not paint him as a saint but explains his flaws in the context of his experiences. Yes, he was an addict, a convict, and even made a porn movie. But these are not separate from his role as a father, friend and the backbone of his family and community. It is welcome that Floyd<strong> </strong>is no longer an anonymous Black man and you can feel the devastation of his family, friends and community in the interviews that pepper the book.</p> <p>Samuels and Olorunnipa\u2019s greatest triumph is placing Floyd\u2019s life in the context of white supremacy. Before we get to Floyd, we learn about his ancestors\u2019 struggles as tenant farmers in the period after slavery was abolished, known as \u201creconstruction\u201d. Rather than abolition marking an end to racism, we grasp how the logic of racism continued<strong>.</strong> Racist laws and segregation became the tools for keeping the Black population oppressed. Floyd\u2019s great-grandfather was stripped of the land and money he had managed to accumulate in tobacco farming, leaving the family in the poverty that was passed down through the generations.</p> <p>The authors<strong> </strong>reflect on the irony of Floyd being killed after allegedly buying cigarettes with a fake $20 bill, given his family\u2019s history with tobacco. Throughout, Floyd\u2019s life is used to discuss issues such as racial terrorism, housing segregation, mass incarceration and racism in schooling. The point is driven home that his life and death were a result of the racism built into American society. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2020/08/29/david-smith-death-minneapolis-police-kneeling/\">David Smith</a> was killed by Minneapolis police in 2010, in an almost identical manner to Floyd, but there was no public outcry.</p> <p>There is a way in which all the attention on Floyd\u2019s death has in some way limited the conversation: we all agree that his murder was indefensible,<strong> </strong>Derek Chauvin went to prison, minimal policing reforms occurred\u2026 and now we can move on. <em>His Name </em><em>Is George Floyd</em> adds to this narrative by focusing on this one event and its aftermath. The lack of any global context severely limits our understanding of racism, which,<strong> </strong>as Malcolm X explained, is \u201cnot just an American problem, but a world problem\u201d.</p> <p>The focus on Floyd also follows the unfortunate pattern of highlighting the plight of Black men, reinforcing how we are drawn to the spectacle. The violence has tended to be public, from lashings on the plantation to lynchings leaving strange fruit hanging from southern trees. The oppression of Black women is more private \u2013 sexual violence, evictions and deadly institutional inequalities, such as being four times more likely to die in childbirth \u2013 and more difficult to capture on camera.</p> <p>Activist and professor Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw started the #SayHerName campaign to draw attention to the Black women who were far more likely to be killed by the police than their white counterparts. I couldn\u2019t read this book without thinking how Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her home by police in 2020, would have been a rich subject.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/13/fear-of-black-consciousness-by-lewis-gordon-review-why-minds-not-bodies-are-the-problem\">Fear of Black Consciousness by Lewis Gordon review \u2013 why minds, not bodies, are the problem</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The horrific murders in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/14/buffalo-shooting-supermarket-new-york\">Buffalo</a> last weekend are a reminder of how a focus on racism can cloud larger issues. Killing sprees by White supremacist males are a symptom of structural racism but they are so violent and public that they, rather than the ways in which society kills Black people every day, become the basis of our discussions.</p> <p>In defence of the authors, they make a valiant effort to use Floyd\u2019s story to educate society about the ills of structural racism; for many readers this will be the first time they have encountered the history that shapes the present.

The Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka was told to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/naomiosaka/status/1305959039902257152\">\u201ckeep politics out of sport\u201d</a> when she brought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/01/naomi-osaka-us-open-misaki-doi\">seven face masks with the names of different victims of police brutality</a> to the US Open. Almost 2,000 people complained to Ofcom \u2013 which has yet to decide whether to investigate \u2013 about the BLM necklace worn by Alesha Dixon on Britain\u2019s Got Talent (only a few weeks after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/17/ofcom-dismisses-complaints-over-blm-dance-on-britains-got-talent\">the programme received 24,500 complaints \u2013 later dismissed by the regulator \u2013 about a performance by the dance group Diversity</a> that was inspired by the police killing of George Floyd).</p> <p>The framing of these moments as radical and political rather than sincere and teachable has raised other questions, such as: are black lives allowed to matter in public spaces \u2013 public spaces that are normally the home of white privilege?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0a6c71b8ae10e16c5815980160db62802371c6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0a6c71b8ae10e16c5815980160db62802371c6a/0_0_1080_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yvonne Orji had the black power fist shaved into her hair for the Emmys\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Nuff said\u2019 ...

The fashion historian Darnell-Jamal Lisby says BLM clothes are perceived as threatening because they \u201cshake the belief that conditioned the world to believe that white people are superior\u201d. He says they \u201cdisrupt a system that privileges those who benefited from the oppression of black people\u201d. As such, the wearing of BLM clothing is suppressed (as in the case of Hamilton) or heavily criticised (as Dixon experienced).</p> <p>Last month\u2019s Emmys were especially powerful not only because of the number of celebrities wearing BLM clothes, but also because the intimate nature of the ceremony (with nominees filmed at home) made their clothes feel more personal than if they were on a red carpet.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/23/sterling-k-brown-black-panther-marvel-people-oj-simpson-this-is-us\">Sterling K Brown</a> of This Is Us wore a dinner jacket over a T-shirt emblazoned with a BLM logo and a black power fist. Yvonne Orji, best known for Insecure, had the fist shaved into her hair. Killing Eve\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/modooborahae/status/1307899586170753027\">Sandra Oh</a> wore a beautiful purple jacket with \u201cBlack lives are precious\u201d written on it in Korean.</p> <p>The T-shirt worn by the Watchmen writer Damon Lindelof was affecting, too. It bore the words \u201cRemember Tulsa \u201921\u201d, which referenced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/01/tulsa-massacre-1921-oklahoma-lawsuit\">the 1921 Tulsa massacre</a>, in which as many as 300 black residents of the city in Oklahoma were killed by white mobs. The Good Place star William Jackson Harper wore a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CFYHSdEpD_4/\">\u201cGood trouble\u201d T-shirt</a> in honour of the late civil rights leader John Lewis. Regina King and Uzo Aduba, who won awards for Watchmen and Mrs America respectively, wore shirts that honoured Breonna Taylor.

The legislation, which would bring about the most significant changes to policing on the federal level, would ban the use of chokeholds and establish a national database of police misconduct.</p> <p>\u201cWe want something coming out of Washington. We want something that will change federal law,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cThere\u2019s been an adjournment on justice for too long. It\u2019s time for them to vote and make this the law.\u201d<br></p> <p>The program of events marking the first anniversary has been organized by the George Floyd Memorial Foundation, a non-profit organization founded by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/22/bridgett-floyd-george-sister-interview-congress-law\">Bridgett Floyd</a>.</p> <p>The events will also include a number of roundtable discussions featuring activists and family members of other Americans killed by police, including Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who was killed by New York City police in 2015, and Katy and Aubrey Wright, the parents of Daunte Wright, who was killed by police in a Minneapolis suburb last month.</p> <p>Floyd was placed in a fatal knee-to-neck restraint by Chauvin in May last year. The incident was captured on video by a number of bystanders and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/22/george-floyd-murder-change-across-world-blm\">sent shockwaves around the world</a>. Last month Chauvin was convicted of second-degree murder and two other felonies and faces up to 40 years in prison. Three other officers involved in the arrest are awaiting trial.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the first anniversary of Floyd\u2019s death, Joe Biden will meet the Floyd family at the White House as negotiations continue in Congress over police reform legislation. The foundation will also host a \u201ccelebration of life\u201d event at a downtown park in Minneapolis.</p> <p>\u201cWe will celebrate the life and legacy of George Floyd through Black culture, art, history and support of local businesses,\u201d organizers said, adding there will be performances from a number of local and \u201cGrammy award-winning artists\u201d.</p> <p>On Friday the foundation awarded a $25,000 scholarship to Fayetteville State University, a historically Black college in North Carolina.</p> <p>Bridgett Floyd presented the check to the university and said: \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about \u2013 generational stamps. We need to put things in place for our kids\u2019 kids. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here to do.\u201d</p> <p>During an address to Congress last month, the president had said he wanted major police reform legislation on his desk by Tuesday, but negotiations are still far from a resolution.</p> <p>One of several <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/05/22/biden-floyd-police-reform-deadline-490206\">sticking points</a> on the bill, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/03/george-floyd-justice-in-policing-act-us-house-democrats\">already passed the Democrat-held House</a>, is the issue of ending qualified immunity, which protects police officers from being personally sued by victims and their families for alleged civil rights violations. While ending or restricting qualified immunity is largely seen as a must-have for police reform advocates, it is staunchly <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/14/police-reform-police-unions-qualified-immunity-democratic-party-420122\">opposed by police unions</a>.</p> <p>\u201cMy concern is, and I\u2019ve communicated this to the White House, is that we come with a toothless bill to meet a hard deadline,\u201d Sharpton, president of the National Action Network, told <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2021/05/22/biden-floyd-police-reform-deadline-490206\">Politico</a>. \u201cI\u2019d rather have a bill with teeth late than a toothless bill on time.\u201d</p> <p>Since Floyd\u2019s killing, at least 17 states, including Minnesota, have enacted legislation to ban or restrict the use of chokeholds and neck restraints by police officers, according to data provided to the Associated Press by the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p> <p>Before then, only two states, Tennessee and Illinois, had bans on such police hold techniques. A majority of the bans enacted over the past year are in states controlled politically by Democrats.</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>"

And when it comes to Congress, I think they could lead the way by passing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. I think it\u2019s essential, and the country needs it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The act named for Floyd <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/03/george-floyd-justice-in-policing-act-us-house-democrats\">passed the Democratic-controlled House</a> but has stalled in the Senate. Key provisions include ending qualified immunity for police officers, which Republicans oppose, and establishing a national standard for the use of force.</p> \n<p>Some Republicans have sought to link a rise in violent crime to efforts for police reform. Senior White House adviser Cedric Richmond, another former congressman, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union: \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to conflate the two.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd we support the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. But we also support investing in these cities, so that they can replenish their law enforcement and we can tackle gun violence, where the guns are coming from, who\u2019s using the guns. How do we do it in a comprehensive manner, so that we employ violent crime interrupters?</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd so we want to do it in a very smart way.

That push intensified after an officer in suburban Brooklyn Center shot and killed Daunte Wright after stopping him for driving with expired tabs. That proposal is not part of the agreement.</p> \n<p>Republicans who control the Minnesota Senate called some Democratic proposals \u201canti-police\u201d, focusing on those pushing to abolish the police and on violent protests following Floyd\u2019s killing.</p> \n<p>The agreement includes $2m for violent crime enforcement teams, a Republican-backed provision.</p>"

But their actions, considered to be one of the most significant and symbolic acts of public dissent in Britain this century, sent shock waves that are still being felt nationally and globally.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"100867103aa74884c9fbd045ae68ef47b3e2368f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/100867103aa74884c9fbd045ae68ef47b3e2368f/0_21_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left to right: Milo Ponsford, 26, Sage Willoughby, 22, Jake Skuse, 33, and Rhian Graham, 30.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left to right: Milo Ponsford, 26, Sage Willoughby, 22, Jake Skuse, 33, and Rhian Graham, 30.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The toppling of Colston \u2013 which came just two weeks after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/29/george-floyd-death-benjamin-crump-jasmine-rand\">murder of George Floyd</a> by Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, sparked antiracist protests around the world \u2013 exploded like a cultural hand grenade.</p> <p>It catalysed a nationwide reassessment of the symbols of Britain\u2019s imperialist past. Within six months nearly 70 tributes to slave traders, colonialists and racists were removed across the UK, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/29/tributes-to-slave-traders-and-colonialists-removed-across-uk\">Guardian</a> tally found, as conversations intensified over which historical figures were appropriate for public veneration.</p> <p>Reverberations were felt as far away as the US where, at the funeral of Floyd himself, Rev Al Sharpton referenced the protest as symbolic of changing attitudes to race, saying: \u201cI\u2019ve seen grandchildren of slave masters tearing down slave masters statue; over in England they put it in the river.\u201d</p> <p>And it triggered outrage on the right. Dozens of so-called \u201cstatue defender\u201d protests across the UK culminated in a chaotic rally by football fans around the statue of Winston Churchill in Trafalgar Square. Impassioned commentators compared protesters to a \u201cwoke Taliban\u201d and warned of efforts to erase British history.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot now try to edit or censor our past,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/12/boris-johnson-says-removing-statues-is-to-lie-about-our-history-george-floyd\">the prime minister tweeted</a>.</p> <p>But as much as it was a trigger for a broader debate, the toppling of Colston\u2019s statue was also the culmination of a uniquely Bristolian story. Erected in 1895, 174 years after Colston\u2019s death, the bronze likeness celebrated a man regarded by some as the city\u2019s philanthropic patron saint.</p> <p>He had given his name to three schools in the city and half a dozen roads, and a number of Bristol\u2019s most ancient institutions owed their existence to his largesse.</p> <p>Every year celebrations were held in Bristol cathedral in Colston\u2019s name. Leading pupils from the schools that bore his name were taken on pilgrimages to see a clump of his hair and his nails preserved like relics in the city\u2019s Merchants Hall.</p> <p>A plaque attached to the plinth on which Colston\u2019s statue stood celebrated him as \u201cone of the most virtuous and wise sons\u201d of Bristol.</p> <p>But concerns had long been raised over his presence. Looming over the heart of south-west England\u2019s most multicultural city, Colston had served as a potent reminder that its wealth was raised off the backs of enslaved people.</p> <p>Giving expert evidence in the trial, the historian David Olusoga described how Colston had made his fortune as shareholder, and eventual head, of Britain\u2019s most-important slave-owning enterprise, the Royal African Company. During his tenure, it kidnapped and enslaved an estimated 85,000 Africans, including 12,000 children.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, it was symbolic of power and lack of respect, and the position of black people as a community,\u201d Ros Martin, a playwright and activist for many years with the Countering Colston campaign, told the Guardian.</p> <p>She said she felt the trial was an \u201cappalling injustice\u201d but that she felt buoyed up by \u201cthe fact that [the defendants] are four young white people feeling empathy and showing empathy and getting people to think\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s moving beyond being a bystander, which is required from all of us,\u201d Martin said.</p> <p>Throughout the 10-day trial, the public gallery was packed with locals, many of whom cheered videos shown in court of the moment Colston fell. Martin was there, and other supporters and friends of the defendants.</p> <p>But others, such as Douglas Peden, a local lawyer, and his two daughters, had come to watch history play out in the courtroom. \u201cIt\u2019s the symbolism of it,\u201d Peden said, admitting he also supported the defendants. \u201cIt\u2019s property and ownership up against freedom of expression.\u201d</p> <p>The feeling was reflected elsewhere in Bristol. Outside a pub in Bristol city centre after court one evening Jodie Lily, from Exeter, told the Guardian she knew at least 10 people who were present when the statue was toppled. \u201cIt\u2019s only those four because they got their faces,\u201d she said. \u201cThat piece of shit should have been taken down.\u201d</p> <p>The bare facts of the case were not in question. Giving evidence, the defendants proudly recounted the roles they played. But they denied criminal damage, arguing their acts were justified by the offence caused in Bristol by the statue.</p> <p>It was a high-risk legal strategy, given that support for the toppling of Colston was not universal, even in Bristol. A week after the statue was felled, a counter protest by the empty plinth drew a 300-strong crowd, including a banner reading \u201call lives matter\u201d.</p> <p>Concerns were felt across the UK. Polling by <a href=\"https://policyexchange.org.uk/historymatterspolling/\">Policy Exchange</a> found nearly half of people opposed the way the statue was toppled, compared with a quarter in support, while <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/philosophy/survey-results/daily/2020/06/08/1ab21/1\">YouGov found</a> that although a slim majority supported Colston\u2019s removal, just more than one in 10 thought it was done in the right way.</p> <p>Nevertheless, change has since come in the wake of Colston\u2019s toppling. Colston Hall, Bristol\u2019s major events venue, changed its name \u2013 finally fulfilling an undertaking first made in 2017 \u2013 to the Bristol Beacon.</p> <p>Colston\u2019s name was removed from pubs, buildings and roads. The 275-year-old Colston society was disbanded and his image was removed from stained glass windows.</p> <p>But at the same time, culture war battle lines were drawn, and the government sensed a populist win. Skuse, Graham, Ponsford and Milo have been cleared but <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/police-crime-sentencing-and-courts-bill-2021-factsheets/police-crime-sentencing-and-courts-bill-2021-criminal-damage-to-memorials-factsheet\">new measures in the government\u2019s police and crime bill</a> will allow courts to send people found guilty of damaging a memorial to prison for 10 years.</p> <p>As critics <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/new-crime-bill-makes-protecting-statues-more-important-than-punishing-rape-says-labour-12248534\">have pointed out</a>, someone caught defacing a statue could, under the proposals, be jailed for longer than someone found guilty of rape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b22e486d5080796c53b138e116057ac0d4affae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b22e486d5080796c53b138e116057ac0d4affae/0_168_5031_3019/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The toppled statue lies on display in M Shed museum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The toppled statue lies on display in M Shed museum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Polly Thomas/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As for Colston himself, since being fished out of the River Avon by Bristol council, his statue has found his way to the city\u2019s M Shed museum, where it has been transformed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/04/edward-colston-statue-potent-historical-artefact-david-olusoga\">according to Olusoga</a>, into \u201cthe most important artefact\u201d of the story of Britain\u2019s relationship with its brutal slave history.</p> <p>There, the statue of the old slave trader lies supine, with red paint daubed on its eyes, mouth and hands.

     "body": "<p>The intricate art of sculpted hair celebrating black identity is front and centre of British Vogue\u2019s April issue. Made up of four different covers around the theme of \u201cjoy\u201d, each edition features different models (Achenrin Madit, Precious Lee, Mona Tougaard and Janaye Furman) with their hair moulded into spherical, coloured balls.</p> <p>But the trend is not new. \u201cIn the 60s and 70s hair sculpture became part of the black consciousness movement,\u201d says Prof Carol Tulloch, the author of The Birth of Cool: Style Narratives of the African ciaspora. \u201cGravity-defying hair creations contributed to the black is beautiful [ideology] and revelled in the beauty of black hair.\u201d</p> <p>It is no coincidence that the resurgence of the trend of manipulating black hair into shapes with a message follows three important moments in black history: the natural hair cause, the killing of George Floyd and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests.</p> <p>As Vogue\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/apr/10/british-vogue-appoints-edward-enninful-as-new-editor\">Edward Enninful </a>writes of the cover in his editor\u2019s letter: \u201c[The models] understood that projecting black joy, in the wake of so much reckoning, would hold particular significance.\u201d</p> <p>Last October, before the US presidential election, the singer Lizzo posted a selfie on Instagram with her hair shaped into \u201c40%\u201d, highlighting the proportion of Americans who failed to vote in 2016.</p> <p>The summer campaign for Marc Jacobs\u2019 bags featured remarkable photos of the artist Laetitia Ky with her hair shaped into a hand, a dog, and the initials of the designer. Ky\u2019s Instagram account features her using wire, wool and needles to create political hair art structures that symbolise police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>\u201cThe purpose of my art has always been to fight for equality, to empower people and to promote the beauty of blackness,\u201d Ky, 25, says. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine stopping using my art to fight.\u201d</p> <p>Ky takes inspiration from the coifs of pre-colonial Africa, where certain tribes would mould their hair to express power and strength. These hairstyles were documented in photographs by white travellers and anthropologists and rendered by artists.</p> <p>Tulloch mentions a cover of Harper\u2019s Bazaar featuring an illustration by the artist Aaron Douglas from 1927 with a Mangbetu woman whose hair is \u201cfanned out into a broad trump\u201d, and a sculpture by Dora Gordine from 1928 featuring \u201cthe head of a black woman from Guadeloupe, her seemingly natural hair moulded \u2026 to create a high crown\u201d.</p> <p>For Ky, hair sculpture is a perfect merging of art and activism. \u201cUsing a creative way to speak about important topics is a very efficient way to raise awareness,\u201d she says.</p>"

The timing of it, in terms of when Covid was really happening, could not have been worse in regard of how did the Aboriginal protest movements across Australia look, at a time when everybody was being told to socially distance, was being told that we had to close borders, we had to not go outside, and all of a sudden you\u2019ve got all these people on the streets protesting.</p> <p>\u201cI think the other thing is that people are reporting it, or the mechanisms to seek out the reporting of it have improved. So there\u2019s a combination of things.\u201d</p> <p>The survey also measured \u201ceveryday\u201d discrimination, defined as \u201cmore chronic, routine, and relatively minor experiences of unfair treatment\u201d, like \u201cbeing treated with less respect and courtesy, receiving poorer service than others at restaurants or stores, or being called names\u201d.</p> <p>Everyday discrimination was highest for Aboriginal people among the groups surveyed, with a sharp rise from December 2018 onwards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v15/index.html?key=1aoxk8YbQpJfJ-DYI1ldpxHsx4AWJgmAKmZuPVnrEf4k&amp;location=docsdata\" data-alt=\"% of people in minority groups who report experiencing one or more forms of everyday discrimination at least weekly\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2020/yacht-charter-v15/index.html?key=1aoxk8YbQpJfJ-DYI1ldpxHsx4AWJgmAKmZuPVnrEf4k&location=docsdata\">% of people in minority groups who report experiencing one or more forms of everyday discrimination at least weekly</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe rise in direct discrimination at the personal level \u2013 that\u2019s the really worrying one,\u201d Hamm said. \u201cThat fundamentally says there are people who have taken it upon themselves to be obnoxious to another person, for no other reason than they feel entitled to.\u201d</p> <p>The report examined how intersectionality influences discrimination, or where people identify with multiple, intersecting groups at the same time.

     "body": "<p>On 30 May 2020, photographer Philip Montgomery captured a police charge during protests in Minneapolis against the killing of George Floyd. The cops look like giant metal insects, every human part of them hidden. You can\u2019t see faces through the glinting visors, or flesh under their robotic armour as they approach with guns blazing through a pale mist of teargas smoke.</p> <p>Blown up to the size of a painting, Montgomery\u2019s spooky monochrome news photo looks like a premonition of the future in the Saatchi Gallery\u2019s engrossing, unsettling exhibition <a href=\"https://www.saatchigallery.com/exhibition/america_in_crisis\">America in Crisis</a>. These sci-fi American stormtroopers mirror the warnings, a year on from the attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters, that the world\u2019s most powerful democracy is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/09/is-the-us-really-heading-for-a-second-civil-war\">heading for a second civil war</a>. Yet America in Crisis is not only about the future. It\u2019s about how the present may be understood by the past.</p> <p>For this show juxtaposes photographs of the US\u2019s current troubles with images of a divided country more than half a century ago. It takes its title from a project organised by the Magnum photographers\u2019 agency in 1969. America in Crisis involved such renowned snappers as <a href=\"https://www.magnumphotos.com/photographer/bruce-davidson/\">Bruce Davidson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.magnumphotos.com/photographer/elliott-erwitt/\">Elliott Erwitt</a> in an exhibition and book reporting the protests, assassinations and inequalities of the 1960s \u2013 a decade that seems in glowing retrospect almost incomparably more hopeful and joyous than today\u2019s bitter times.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d41df020b48c1102e8a710ee1c69b04e7e9210e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d41df020b48c1102e8a710ee1c69b04e7e9210e9/0_0_3234_4800/674.jpg\" alt=\"Asking a question America still hasn\u2019t answered \u2026 The Selma March, Alabama, US, 1965.\" width=\"674\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Asking a question America still hasn\u2019t answered \u2026 The Selma March, Alabama, US, 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bruce Davidson/Magnum Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the 60s don\u2019t look so optimistic in Erwitt\u2019s devastating photograph of Jackie Kennedy at her husband\u2019s funeral in 1963. Today the most famous images of her black-clad mourning are Andy Warhol\u2019s silkscreen pantings but where they are ashen icons, Erwitt takes us closer, through her veil, to see every twitch of her breaking face. Where she takes the tragedy of a nation on herself, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2020/jul/17/robert-f-kennedy-funeral-train-by-paul-fusco-in-pictures\">Paul Fusco</a>\u2019s colour pictures of the train that carried Bobby Kennedy\u2019s coffin from New York to Washington in 1968, met by grieving crowds along the way, portray a great community of pain. Black and white Americans squeeze together along a platform to salute the passing train, from which Fusco was watching with his camera.</p> <p>In 2020 it was not the slaying of a famous politician that got people on the streets but the murder of a citizen, Floyd, during his arrest by Minneapolis police that united one half of America in tears of rage. One of the most convincing continuities in this exhibition is between images of the 60s civil rights movement and Black Lives Matter. Davidson\u2019s photographs of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/from-the-archive-blog/2015/mar/20/selma-montgomery-freedom-march-martin-luther-king-1965\">Selma freedom march in 1965</a> pick individuals out of the crowd whose faces make you wonder where they are now, what their later lives were like: a young Black marcher gazes at us over the American flag he\u2019s carrying, asking a question America still hasn\u2019t answered. Kris Graves\u2019s picture of Robert E Lee\u2019s equestrian statue in Richmond, Virginia in 2020, its colossal plinth completely covered with graffiti, points right past the 1960s to the never-healed wounds of slavery. The most startling images here from the original America in Crisis collection are portraits of Black sharecroppers in South Carolina in 1966. They seem still to be living in the Great Depression.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"321c9bffd057faf4894af18eb623172e51e56e44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/321c9bffd057faf4894af18eb623172e51e56e44/0_0_1031_1302/792.jpg\" alt=\"Never-healed wounds \u2026 Lee Square, Richmond, Virginia, 2020.\" width=\"792\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Never-healed wounds \u2026 Lee Square, Richmond, Virginia, 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kris Graves/Courtesy of Sasha Wolf Projects</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps America is timeless in its wrongs, its founding sin, the hypocrisy of a nation based on the declaration that all people \u201care created equal\u201d when southern states based their way of life on slavery, so endemic in its history that it cannot go on like this. Yet as you explore America in Crisis, the parallels between past and present fade. Things are clearly getting worse.</p> <p>There was hope and joy in 1969, after all. Protest, 60s style, seems innocent and childlike now. In <a href=\"http://marcriboud.com/en/portfolio-4/\">Marc Riboud</a>\u2019s definitive image of the era, a young woman called Jane Rose Kasmir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/nov/07/jan-rose-kasmir-anti-vietnam-rally-pentagon\">holds up a flower to the guns of National Guardsmen</a> during an anti-war march in 1967. LOVE says the banner behind two protesters at the Democratic convention in 1968.</p> <p>The keyword now is HATE. One photograph says it all: the silhouette of Donald Trump at a rally. There was no one like Trump in 1969. A picture of Richard Nixon is offered by comparison but any similarities are superficial: yes, Nixon showed how Republicans could benefit from culture wars by marshalling a \u201csilent majority\u201d of middle Americans horrified by the perceived excesses of the flower children, but when Watergate was exposed he went quietly. Trump refused to accept the result of a fair election, a lie his supporters still believe, and so took the US into completely uncharted territory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2022/jan/21/america-in-crisis-in-pictures\">America in Crisis \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You see this leap into chaos in photographs of the attack on the Capitol last January. <a href=\"https://balazsgardi.com/\">Balasz Gardi</a> photographed a man in 18th-century revolutionary garb waving the US flag with a gang of masked putschists on the Capitol steps. This character dressed for a far-right version of the musical Hamilton is claiming the heritage of the founding fathers for an act that spat on the democracy they created. At times of violent change, wrote Karl Marx, when people are \u201ccreating something previously non-existent, at just such epochs of \u2026 crisis they anxiously summon up the spirits of the past to their aid\u201d. The Capitol rioters in their weird costumes from a half-forgotten American history opened a new age that nothing from the past can help us to understand.

Vialva is the seventh person to be executed on federal charges since July. </p> \n  <p>Vialva\u2019s lawyer said that race played a role in her client\u2019s place on death row.

     "body": "<p>The number of employers implementing new diversity and inclusion drives has almost trebled since the end of the Black Lives Matter protests, new research shows. </p> <p>A total of 27% of minority-ethnic workers said their employers had introduced new initiatives during the last 12 months in response to the global movement, according to an Opinium survey of 2,000 adults. This was an increase from 10% in 2020, the year in which protests began after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/24/trial-george-floyd-murder-minneapolis-three-ex-police-officers\">George Floyd was murdered</a> by a police officer in the US state of Minnesota.</p> <p>The latest Multicultural Britain survey, undertaken by the pollsters in partnership with the advocacy organisation Reboot, said that almost half (47%) of minority-ethnic workers had seen their employer take some sort of action to tackle racism and diversity problems \u2013 up from 40% in 2020.</p> <p>\u201cWe were interested in questioning whether promises made by employers after George Floyd were just an example of performative activism or if we were still seeing the action happening today, which is why we specifically asked whether employers have taken action,\u201d said Priya Minhas, the lead researcher of the Multicultural Britain series.</p> <p>In 2020, 73% of minority-ethnic people said they had experienced discrimination, but this year, for the first time since the Multicultural Britain series began in 2016, that figure dropped to 64%. Minhas said that it was difficult to tell whether this was positive change as a result of the global protests or because of people largely working from home and restrictions in socialising due to the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cWhile there have been improvements in increased satisfaction in what employers are doing, and more people feeling that businesses and organisations are making an authentic effort to tackle racism, there is still work to be done and clearly there are still issues in the workplaces that need to be addressed,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The survey results show that there have been some positive changes in the workplace \u2013 somewhat allaying concerns that businesses and companies were committing to anti-racism only in the height of the summer of 2020.</p> <p>Sereena Abbassi, an inclusion practitioner who has worked with organisations including Sony Music, the NHS and English National Ballet, said there were encouraging signs the protests were a watershed moment. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/06/bristol-mayor-colston-four-verdict-has-little-to-do-with-drive-to-tackle-racism\">Bristol mayor: Colston Four verdict has little to do with drive to tackle racism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She said: \u201cIn some instances, there are businesses and employers who were very performative in their work and the catalyst seemed to be George Floyd\u2019s murder for them to accelerate their work around diversity, inclusion and equity, but there are also others who have decided to take it very slow and are instead doing the work quietly, rather than showing up just for the optics.\u201d</p> <p>Abbassi added that she had seen a continued appetite from companies and organisations to want to work with her and that the protests had inspired people to change.</p> <p>From the clients Abbassi has worked with, she feels training sessions and conversations have been successful in contributing to a more diverse and inclusive workspace.</p> <p>She said: \u201cMore businesses are thinking about positive action and organisations have developed initiatives like mentoring schemes to ensure junior staff have contact with senior staff. After the protests we saw a lot of rage from people of colour, but also white allies within organisations.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/mar/02/unconscious-bias-training-alone-will-not-stop-discrimination-say-critics\">Unconscious bias training alone will not stop discrimination, say critics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked about the survey results that showed people were having fewer conversations about race this year than in the summer of 2020, Abbassi said a possible reason for this was that there was a real sense of fatigue when discussing race, especially for ethnic minorities who carry the burden of educating white people in their workplaces. She added that people may be concerned that having conversations about race would lead to them saying the wrong things and that it could cost them their job.</p> <p>Lawrence Heming, the assistant director of EY\u2019s UK diversity and equity team, said the survey results showed it was important for people to understand how recent events such as the pandemic and Black Lives Matter protests had affected things, either positively or negatively, for ethnic minorities.</p> <p>Heming says although the results showed that some issues surrounding race were still prevalent and that \u201cwe are nowhere where I would say we need to be\u201d, there were findings that suggested things were slowly shifting.</p> <p>He added: \u201cMore firms in the corporate sector are introducing initiatives and policies to tackle racism and more people are being more mindful on certain issues \u2013 this has had a positive impact, but it is important for places to still be held accountable, today, for the commitments they made in 2020.\u201d</p>"

In the decades since, law enforcement associations have dramatically expanded their powers through their <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-police-union-power-helped-increase-abuses\">contracts</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to think of police as traditional workers,\u201d said Veena Dubal, a University of California, Hastings law professor and labor expert, and former Berkeley police review commissioner. \u201cThey are the only people in our country who have the right to take away life and to do so with immunity. They are unequivocally forces that seek to insulate police from any kind of accountability, and that\u2019s very different than what a union does.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Everything that police associations push for the hardest are the things that allow the police to be harmful</p> <footer> <cite>Nana Gyamfi</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The unions have negotiated a wide range of exceptional rights for officers, including <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-police-unions/\">requiring</a> departments to erase misconduct records from officers\u2019 files, giving them a clean slate.

Kueng and Thao are additionally accused of failing to intervene to stop Chauvin, who was last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">found guilty</a> of Floyd\u2019s murder and sentenced to 22 and a half years in prison.</p> <p>Chauvin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/15/derek-chauvin-pleads-guilty-civil-rights-charges-george-floyd-killing\">admitted violating</a> Floyd\u2019s civil rights in his additional federal case last December following Floyd\u2019s murder, which triggered protests worldwide and a re-examination of racism and policing.</p> <p>All were fired from their jobs and arrested days after Floyd\u2019s killing in 2020.</p> <p>Thao, Kueng and Lane have pleaded not guilty in both their federal joint civil rights case and their state criminal case, which is due later this year and in which they are accused of aiding and abetting murder.</p> <p>In the current trial taking place in St Paul, the Minnesota state capital, one of the prosecution\u2019s key arguments is that they were trained to provide medical aid in emergencies, and that Floyd\u2019s situation had become so serious as police held him down that bystanders, even children with no medical training, knew something was wrong.</p> <p>Kelly McCarthy, chief of police in Mendota Heights police department and chair of Minnesota\u2019s Police Officers Standards and Training board, testified last week that officers are specifically taught to reposition someone who is restrained face down, to ensure they can breathe.</p> <p>Asked why, she said: \u201cThere were enough in-custody deaths that we needed to have a learning objective on it.\u201d</p> <p>A day earlier, the head of the Minneapolis police department\u2019s homicide unit testified that the officers should have intervened to begin first aid or take action that even means moving another officer out of the way if necessary.</p> <p>Lt Richard Zimmerman, who also testified at Chauvin\u2019s trial last year, said when the other officers saw Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck \u201cthe officers should have intervened at that point and stopped it\u201d.</p> <p>But defense arguments have repeatedly focused on the condition termed excited delirium, and the training of police to respond to it, suggesting the officers were following procedure about restraining someone they thought was experiencing such a health syndrome.</p> <p>The Minneapolis police department and the office of the city mayor, Jacob Frey, have said<a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-police-trained-ignore-citys-civil-rights-report-on-ketamine-excited-delirium-inspector/600141547/\"> the city halted such training last year</a>, after the <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/new-ama-policy-opposes-excited-delirium-diagnosis\">American Medical Association (AMA) </a>rejected the diagnosis of excited delirium.</p> <p>The AMA, called it a \u201cmanifestation of systemic racism\u201d that had been misapplied to justify excessive police force or </p> <p>pharmacological interventions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/01/elijah-mcclain-colorado-grand-jury-indicts-five-over-black-mans-death\">such as ketamine</a> and \u201cdisproportionately cited in cases where Black men die in law enforcement custody\u201d.</p> <p>But a Minneapolis police training video of the updated process, <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-police-still-teaching-excited-delirium-syndrome-despite-claiming-it-stopped/600146112/?refresh=true\">obtained through a public records request</a> from the Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper, showed officers still being trained using studies with \u201cexcited delirium\u201d in the titles. The video included an emergency physician advising that the term had become \u201ctriggering\u201d and suggesting that another term should be used, such as \u201csevere agitation with delirium\u201d.</p> <p>In either respect, the diagnosis is controversial. Federal prosecutors played a portion of Lane\u2019s body-camera video showing the officers describing elements of their struggle to try to put Floyd in their squad car after they had arrived outside a corner store <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/23/christopher-martin-george-floyd-minneapolis-cup-foods\">following a report</a> that he had tried to use counterfeit money.</p> <p>\u201cHe kind of seemed like he was on something ... He was fighting the whole time,\u201d Lane said.</p> <p>Lane\u2019s attorney later focused on how his client is seen on video calling for an ambulance and expressing concern that Floyd might be experiencing \u201cexcited delirium\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShould we roll him on the side?\u201d Lane asked. \u201cI just worry about the excited delirium or whatever.\u201d</p> <p>An autopsy later revealed that Floyd had fentanyl, a powerful opioid sedative and painkiller, and methamphetamine, a stimulant, in his system but neither were listed as the cause of death.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/11/excited-delirium-derek-chauvin-trial-defense-george-floyd\">issue came up</a> in Derek Chauvin\u2019s trial last year when jurors heard from defense attorneys arguing Chauvin acted reasonably and that officers are taught how to recognize signs of the physical and psychiatric state known as excited delirium from incoherence, extraordinary strength, sweat, or suffering from abnormal body temperature, or if a person appears to have suddenly snapped.</p> <p>Forensic expert Bill Smock<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsC42qGj9go&amp;t=51s\"> testified</a> that Floyd met none of the 10 criteria developed by the American College of Emergency Physicians. Prosecutors described the topic as a \u201cstory\u201d created by Chauvin\u2019s defense to shift blame for Floyd\u2019s death after fatally depriving him of oxygen.</p> <p>In the current trial, the court heard testimony from Derek Smith, a paramedic dispatched to the scene. He acknowledged the dispute over the diagnosis, indicated that in his experience it is real, and said he suspected Floyd had the condition based on what officers told him.</p> <p>Controversy over the diagnosis is set to continue despite the change in name to \u201csevere agitation with delirium\u201d. And <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-police-trained-ignore-citys-civil-rights-report-on-ketamine-excited-delirium-inspector/600141547/?refresh=true\">according to the Star Tribune</a>, the Minneapolis police department instructed officers to ignore the findings from <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-police-oversight-office-calls-for-stronger-policy-in-ketamine-report/489292511/\">a watchdog investigation </a>that found police inappropriately asking paramedics to sedate uncooperative people.</p> <p>Prosecutors have told the court that they will rest their case on Monday after three weeks of testimony.</p>"

She was one of 14 to face criminal charges \u2013 making her case exceptionally rare in the US.</p> <p>Sahouri, 25, has spent the last 10 months of her life fighting those charges, which included \u201cfailure to disperse\u201d and \u201cinterference with official acts\u201d. If convicted, she would have had to pay a fine and spend a month in prison.</p> <p>In a courtroom last week, Sahouri breathed a sigh of relief after she was acquitted of all charges.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just feeling really powerful,\u201d she said over Zoom, explaining how it felt to be found not guilty.</p> <p>\u201cAnd relieved. I had like over 200 unchecked text messages. I can\u2019t even look at my Twitter. Every time I do, it is overwhelming. I just received a lot of support from every corner of the globe so that was just a super surreal feeling. At one point, Amnesty [International] had launched a school-level campaign and there were these students in Sweden who had signs that said \u2018we stand with Andrea.\u2019 They sent me pictures of them holding up the signs.\u201d</p> <p>Denise Bell of Amnesty International said: \u201cJournalists must be able to report on scenes of protest without fear of retribution. The right of the media to do their work is essential to the right of freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly. Clearly, the jury saw these charges for what they are \u2013 completely ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>On 31 May, Sahouri was arrested by a Des Moines police officer while she was peacefully working. She called the event \u201ca very traumatizing experience\u201d. The photographs of her in sneakers, jeans and a tank top, restrained and surrounded by police officers were shared widely across social media and news outlets around the world.</p> <p>Recounting the incident, she said: \u201cI look back and I see an officer coming out of nowhere. Like charging at me. I thought at that moment: \u2018Put up your hands. Stop. Don\u2019t run from police, Comply.\u2019 I immediately put up my hands and said multiple times that I was press. The officer instead grabbed me, pepper-sprayed me directly at close range to my face and said \u2018That\u2019s not what I asked.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The officer, Luke Wilson, claimed he believed Sahouri was a protester because she was not wearing any press identification. Other local journalists on the scene as well as Sahouri\u2019s colleague, another Des Moines Register reporter Katie Akin, informed the officer that Sahouri was, in fact, a journalist. <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/03/09/andrea-sahouri-trial-witnesses-testify-iowa-journalist-arrest-case/6926331002/\">Bodycam footage</a> from another officer shown during Sahouri\u2019s trial captured her telling officers she was just doing her job.</p> <p>During Wilson\u2019s testimony on the first day of trial, he said he did not \u201chave a whole lot of conversation\u201d with Sahouri. \u201cOnce I determined she wasn\u2019t leaving, I had to take action.\u201d He maintained that he didn\u2019t know she was a journalist.</p> <p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t understand it,\u201d Sahouri said. \u201cI had the same employee badge that Katie had shown the officers, but it wasn\u2019t on me. I kept saying \u2018I have a badge\u2019 but they didn\u2019t want to see it.\u201d</p> <p>Sahouri, along with then boyfriend Spenser Robnett, were pepper-sprayed, zip-tied, and placed in the back of a police van where she recorded a video explaining what just happened. Wilson failed to turn on his body camera though he was required to. The pair were taken to Polk county jail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f93a7ef21ae6f1aba46d81bf945c393c84782d97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f93a7ef21ae6f1aba46d81bf945c393c84782d97/0_0_2547_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A press badge for Des Moines Register reporter Andrea Sahouri features her jail booking photo from her 31 May 2020 arrest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"785\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A press badge for Des Moines Register reporter Andrea Sahouri features her jail booking photo from her 31 May 2020 arrest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrea Sahouri/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asked why Sahouri, who is Palestinian American, thought she was arrested while other journalists at the protest were not, she said: \u201cGreat question.

I realized how anxious I would get about little things like having to text a police officer about a crime I had to write about. There were a few days that were just harder.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement urging the Polk county attorney to drop all charges brought against Sahouri, Bruce Brown, executive director of Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said: \u201cLaw enforcement should never have arrested Andrea Sahouri in the first place simply for doing her job as a reporter, and the decision to move forward with her prosecution flies in the face of the first amendment.\u201d</p> <p>The prosecution refused to drop the charges. Sahouri said there was nothing left to do but place trust in her \u201cextremely smart and skilled\u201d legal defense team, paid for by her paper\u2019s parent company, Gannett Media.</p> <p>Before and during her trial, Sahouri also had the support of Columbia\u2019s journalism school, where she obtained her master\u2019s degree.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t study journalism undergrad but it was my senior year and I was like \u2018you know, I really like to talk to people. I love to amplify others\u2019 voices\u2019. I love to write. I\u2019m good at talking to people and I don\u2019t really like a normal office setting. I had a passion for documenting history, telling stories and informing communities.\u201d</p> <p>She said her background had inspired her to pursue journalism as a career.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a Palestinian American and I actually grew up really frustrated with the media because I had always felt like there was never the Palestinian narrative. They would talk about Palestine but never include Palestinian voices and that really frustrated me. I didn\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p> <p>Sahouri is sure to cover more protests in the future. Apart from maybe carrying her press pass on her person, she won\u2019t be doing anything differently.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to change my behavior. I did my job and I did it correctly. I did my job while complying with police orders and that\u2019s what the evidence exactly showed. The jury decided as well.\u201d</p> <p>Sahouri also said she refuses to let this experience taint her outlook on her career. After taking one week off to relax, she is looking forward to getting back to work.</p> <p>\u201cI really want to get into investigations \u2026 That\u2019s really a big passion of mine. I\u2019m just excited to continue to do my job.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The crisis-plagued Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the body that organises the Golden Globes, has expelled Philip Berk, its former president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/apr/20/golden-globes-former-president-sends-anti-blm-black-lives-matter-email\">who sparked widespread outrage</a> by sharing an anti-Black Lives Matter article that described the movement as a \u201cracist hate group\u201d.</p> <p>In a brief statement, the HFPA said: \u201cEffective immediately, Phil Berk is no longer a member of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.\u201d The HFPA\u2019s move follows outspoken criticism from NBC, the TV network that broadcasts and pays for the Golden Globes, which called for Berk\u2019s expulsion. \u201cNBC strongly condemns Phil Berk\u2019s actions \u2026 [and] swift action on this front is an essential element for NBC to move forward with the HFPA and the Golden Globes.\u201d</p> <p>Berk\u2019s removal followed the controversy over his email, reported by the LA Times, in which he forwarded an article by a rightwing website. A number of HFPA members had responded angrily to Berk\u2019s email, with one writing: \u201cThe vile rhetoric contained in this screed is simply unacceptable\u201d, and another calling Berk \u201ca thundering disgrace\u201d.</p> <p>However, the HFPA was hit by further problems after it was reported that Dr Shaun Harper, its recently hired diversity and inclusion adviser, had resigned. Harper, the executive director of USC\u2019s Race and Equity Center, had been hired as a consultant by the HFPA after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/08/times-up-criticises-hfpa-over-golden-globes-diversity-plan\">criticism of the lack of diversity among the organisation\u2019s membership</a>. He reportedly resigned after a meeting with representatives of the Time\u2019s Up campaign group, including director-producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ava-duvernay\">Ava DuVernay</a> and producer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shonda-rhimes\">Shonda Rhimes</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/golden-globes-hfpa-in-crisis-as-famed-fixer-di-advisor-quit-exclusive?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=THR%20Breaking%20News&amp;utm_term=hollywoodreporter_breakingnews\">The Hollywood Reporter quoted Harper\u2019s resignation letter</a>, which said: \u201cI no longer have confidence in our ability to collaboratively deliver the transformational change that the industry and the people in it whom I deeply respect are demanding of you.\u201d</p> <p>Another of the HFPA\u2019s recently hired consultants, crisis management firm Smith &amp; Company, which is run by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/20/sony-celebrity-spin-doctor-judy-smith-interview-north-korea-scandal-hacking\">celebrated \u201ccrisis guru\u201d Judy Smith</a>, has also <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/race/golden-globes-hfpa-in-crisis-as-famed-fixer-di-advisor-quit-exclusive?__twitter_impression=true\">reportedly departed</a> from its advisory role.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/mar/16/film-industry-celebrities-boycott-golden-globes-hollywood-foreign-press-association\">The crisis engulfing the HFPA </a>began shortly before the Golden Globes award ceremony in January, when an LA Times report accused the organisation of a lack of diversity in its membership as well as \u201cethical lapses\u201d in the way it conducted its business.</p>"

     "body": "<p>I started going to demonstrations when I was 17. At first, I went to protests against Israel\u2019s military occupation. Then we also began to protest against the authoritarianism of the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, and the <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2017/2/19/how-factionalism-is-killing-the-palestinian-struggle\">sickening rivalry</a> between Palestinian political factions. For Palestinians, protest has become a way of life \u2013 a way to <a href=\"https://www.palestine-studies.org/sites/default/files/jq-articles/To_Exist_to_Resist_JQ_59_0.pdf\">be steadfast</a>, to persevere.</p> <p>Over the past decade, much of this burden of protest has been borne by individual Palestinian families facing expulsion or violence at the hands of soldiers and settlers. The threat of evictions or demolitions will spark a local protest, in the hope of preventing this or that particular outrage. But right now the attention of the world is on us not as individuals, but as a collective, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/14/gazans-flee-as-israel-bombards-territory-from-air-sea-and-land\">as Palestinians</a>. It is not only about one village or one family or \u201conly those in the West Bank\u201d or \u201conly those in Jerusalem\u201d.</p> <p>What we are in the streets protesting about now is not one killing or one violent raid, but a whole regime of oppression that destroys our bodies, our homes, our communities, our hopes \u2013 just as the protests for Black lives that spread across the US last year were not only about<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/13/george-floyd-trial-date-police-officers-latest\"> George Floyd </a>or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/breonna-taylor\">Breonna Taylor</a> or any one killing.</p> <p>This is what colonialism does: it suffocates every part of your life, and then it finishes by burying you. It is a strategic, deliberate process, and it is only obstructed or delayed because oppressors are almost always confronted and challenged by those under their rule. In the end, who wants to be chained down for being born who they are?</p> <p>Last week, I was near the illegal settlement of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/12/israel-settlers-put-their-faith-in-trump-netanyahu-visit-white-house\">Beit El</a> by Ramallah in the West Bank as the Israeli army sent jeeps rushing towards demonstrators, journalists and medical staff, firing high-velocity teargas canisters directly at the crowd.</p> <p>The sound of those canisters spiralling towards us in the dozens still makes me tremble. It reminds me of the day in December 2011, in the village of Nabi Saleh, when an Israeli soldier fired a teargas canister, from close range, directly at the face of 28-year-old Palestinian stone-thrower <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/11/clashes-at-mustafa-tamimi-funeral\">Mustafa Tamimi</a>, who died as a result of the injury.</p> <p>I remember the face of then six-year-old Janna Tamimi, his cousin, as she screamed in her fragile voice: \u201cWhy did you kill my best friend?\u201d Behind her was the illegal settlement of Halamish. Mustafa\u2019s protest was against the settlement expansion and the impunity of settler violence as he and his community were imprisoned in the village, with no access to water springs or public services.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/14/violence-israel-gaza-bloodshed-palestinians\">Once this violence in Israel and Gaza ends, there can be no return to 'normal' | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fact that these protests are leaderless is a sign of what has been festering for decades among all Palestinians.

But at the same time, it is a complete reclamation of faith, not in international policymakers, not in negotiation committees, not in humanitarian observers and NGOs, but in ourselves.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you always have to put yourself on the frontlines?\u201d my mother reprimanded me years ago, as she threw away my clothes that were soaked in noxious \u201c<em>kharara</em>\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34227609\">skunk water</a>, sprayed by the Israeli military.</p> <p>Often used in protests in the West Bank, Israeli forces have also now been spraying it on the streets of Sheikh Jarrah and the homes of Palestinians. It\u2019s an attempt to make our <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2021/5/12/the-skunk-another-israeli-weapon-for-collective-punishment\">lives so unbearable</a> that we are driven out.</p> <p>I wanted to tell my mother, if it isn\u2019t me, it\u2019s someone else.

     "body": "<p>An Israeli company that sells spyware to governments is linked to fake Black Lives Matter and<strong> </strong>Amnesty International websites that are used to hack targets, according to a new report.</p> <p>Researchers from the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, who worked with Microsoft, <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/\">issued a report on Thursday</a> about the potential targets of Candiru, a Tel Aviv-based firm marketing \u201cuntraceable\u201d spyware that can infect and monitor computers and phones.</p> <p>One way the company\u2019s spyware allegedly infects targets is through web domains, and the researchers found that the firm\u2019s software was associated with URLs masquerading as NGOs, women\u2019s rights advocates, activist groups, health organizations and news media. Citizen Lab\u2019s research uncovered websites tied to Candiru with domain<strong> </strong>names such as \u201cAmnesty Reports\u201d, \u201cRefugee International\u201d, \u201cWoman Studies\u201d, \u201cEuro News\u201d and \u201cCNN 24-7\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/13/ransomware-gang-revils-websites-become-unreachable\">Ransomware gang REvil's websites become unreachable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The researchers have not identified specific targets of the websites impersonating human rights groups, and have not confirmed the involvement of any specific government clients. Microsoft said it appeared that Candiru sells the spyware that enables the hacks, and that the governments generally choose who to target and run the operations themselves.</p> <p>The findings suggest that a secretive and little-known company with a wide global reach could be helping governments hack and monitor people in civil society. The report comes amid growing concerns about surveillance technologies that can aid human rights abuses and law enforcement <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/us/politics/george-floyd-protests-surveillance.html\">monitoring</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/27/americas-protest-crackdown-five-months-after-george-floyd-hundreds-face-trials-and-prison\">crackdowns on Black Lives Matter</a> and related activist groups.</p> <p>Microsoft\u2019s threat intelligence center, which tracks security threats and cyberweapons, conducted its own analysis and said it found at least 100 targets of malware linked to Candiru, including politicians, human rights activists, journalists, academics, embassy workers and political dissidents. Microsoft found targets in the UK, Palestine, Israel, Iran, Lebanon, Yemen, Spain, Turkey, Armenia and Singapore, the report said.</p> <p>Microsoft said in a blogpost on Thursday that it had disabled the \u201ccyberweapons\u201d of Candiru and built protections against the malware, including issuing a Windows software update.</p> <p>There are no legitimate reasons for intelligence firms or their government customers to create websites that impersonate high-profile activist groups and not-for-profit organizations, said Bill Marczak, a co-author of the report, in an interview.</p> <p>Activists who are targeted may click on links that appear to be from trusted sources and then be taken to a site with innocuous content or redirected elsewhere, he explained. \u201cBut this website, which was specially registered for the purpose of exploiting their computer, would run code in the background that would silently hijack control of their computer,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The malware could enable \u201cpersistent access to essentially everything on the computer\u201d potentially allowing governments to steal passwords and documents or turn on a microphone to spy on a victim\u2019s surroundings.</p> <p>\u201cThe user wouldn\u2019t recognize anything was amiss,\u201d said Marczak, a senior research fellow with the Citizen Lab, which has scrutinized British, German and Italian spyware firms, and previously exposed the activities of NSO Group, another Israeli company that allegedly enabled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/cat-and-mouse-game-how-citizen-lab-shone-a-spotlight-on-israeli-spyware-firm-nso\">government hacking of journalists</a> and activists.</p> <p>The use of spyware can have devastating consequences for activists and dissidents. Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist in the the United Arab Emirates, was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/30/technology/governments-turn-to-commercial-spyware-to-intimidate-dissidents.html\">jailed and faced violence</a> after he was hacked and monitored through spyware purchased by the UAE. He was targeted by sophisticated government phishing attempts, including a 2016 <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/media_2021/01/uae0121.pdf\">text message</a> with a link on his phone that purported to include information about the torture of detainees in UAE prisons.</p> <h2>A \u2018mercenary spyware industry\u2019</h2> <p>There is minimal information publicly available about Candiru, which was founded in 2014 and has undergone several name changes, the report said. It is now believed to be registered as Saito Tech Ltd, but is still known as Candiru. In 2017, the firm had sales worth nearly $30m, serving clients in the Gulf, western Europe and Asia, according to a <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/tech-news/.premium-mobile-spytech-millions-in-gulf-deals-top-secret-israeli-cyberattack-firm-reve-1.9125915\">lawsuit</a> reported in an Israeli newspaper. Candiru may have deals with Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Forbes has <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/10/03/meet-candiru-the-super-stealth-cyber-mercenaries-hacking-apple-and-microsoft-pcs-for-profit/?sh=42ceecd55a39\">reported</a>.</p> <p>Candiru allegedly offers a range of ways for clients to hack targets, including through hyperlinks, physical attacks and a program called \u201cSherlock\u201d, the report said, citing a leaked project proposal <a href=\"https://www.themarker.com/embeds/pdf_upload/2020/20200902-161742.pdf\">document</a> from the company. It\u2019s unclear what \u201cSherlock\u201d does. The firm also sells tools for Signal and Twitter, according to the report. The leaked proposal document included an agreement that said the product would not be used in the US, Russia, China, Israel or Iran.</p> <p>Microsoft, however, reported finding victims in Israel and Iran.</p> <p>Citizen Lab said it was able to identify a computer that had been hacked by Candiru\u2019s malware, and then used that hard drive to extract a copy of the firm\u2019s Windows spyware. The owner of the computer was a \u201cpolitically active\u201d individual in western Europe, the report said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7516e97cdb695289153bea2c8c5e8b7571e4927\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7516e97cdb695289153bea2c8c5e8b7571e4927/0_0_3500_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Silhouette of a man waving a large Black Lives Matter flag against a background of the setting sun.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Candiru impersonated Black Lives Matter sites to hack its targets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The team also identified more than 750 domain names that appeared to be linked to Candiru and its customers. In addition to the sites masquerading as not-for-profits, the researchers found URLs that appeared to impersonate a left-leaning Indonesian publication; a site that publishes Israeli court indictments of Palestinian prisoners; a website critical of Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman; and a site that appeared to be associated with the World Health Organization.</p> <p>\u201cCandiru\u2019s apparent presence, and the use of its surveillance technology against global civil society, is a potent reminder that the mercenary spyware industry contains many players and is prone to widespread abuse,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis case demonstrates, yet again, that in the absence of any international safeguards or strong government export controls, spyware vendors will sell to government clients who will routinely abuse their services.\u201d</p> <p>The report does not allege specific violations of the law, though it\u2019s difficult to evaluate legality without knowing which nations were involved in the hacking.</p> <p>The findings about Candiru suggest that there are systematic problems with the spyware industry and how it is regulated, said Marczak. \u201cIt\u2019s not just one bad apple,\u201d he said, referencing NSO Group, whose spyware was allegedly used against a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/28/saudi-arabia-new-york-times-reporter-hacking-allegations-mbs\">New York Times reporter</a> who authored a book on Prince Mohammed and an Amnesty International <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2018/08/amnesty-international-among-targets-of-nso-powered-campaign/?\">staff member</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe desperately need to understand this industry better, because it\u2019s growing much faster than we can track, and it\u2019s larger than we know,\u201d added John Scott-Railton, another Citizen Lab researcher and co-author, noting that governments are also becoming increasingly vulnerable to hacking and spying by other states. \u201cIt\u2019s an urgent national security concern, and governments around the world are going to find themselves targeted by this technology, if they haven\u2019t already.\u201d</p> <p>Candiru representatives did not immediately respond to the Guardian\u2019s requests for comment on Thursday.</p>"

     "body": "<p>A landmark report on racial disparity has been widely condemned by MPs, unions, and equality campaigners as \u201cdivisive\u201d and a missed opportunity for systematic change.</p> <p>Critics said the report by the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities had failed to acknowledge the \u201cshocking disparities and shocking outcomes in health, education and housing\u201d affecting minority communities in the UK.</p> <p>Labour also called on the government to explain one of the most contentious passages, which, it alleges, glorifies the slave trade.</p> <p>Published in full on Wednesday after selective leaks to the media earlier in the week, the report marks a significant shift in government policy, stating its findings \u201cpresent a new race agenda for the country\u201d.</p> <p>The review behind the report was set up by Downing Street to investigate racial disparities in the UK in response to the Black Lives Matter protests last summer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2021/mar/31/no-evidence-britain-institutionally-racist-government-commission-covid-coronavirus-boris-johnson-live-updates\">Race commission report suggests 'idealism' of BLM campaigners counter-productive for racial equality \u2013 live </a> </p> </aside>  <p>The commission\u2019s report notes that while racism and racial injustice do still exist geography, family influence, socio-economic background, culture and religion all have a greater impact on life chances.</p> <p>In a foreword to the report, commission chairman Dr Tony Sewell said some communities are haunted by historic racism and there was a \u201creluctance to acknowledge that the UK had become open and fairer\u201d. He said the review found some evidence of bias, but often it was a perception that the wider society could not be trusted.</p> <p>Simon Woolley, who was head of No 10\u2019s race disparity unit until last summer, criticised the commission for disrespecting and disregarding people\u2019s lived experience.</p> <p>Lord Woolley said: \u201cIf you deny structural race inequality then you\u2019ve got nothing to do and that in of itself is a huge problem. There was structural racism before Covid-19 and Black Lives Matter, in all areas and all levels of our society. There are shocking disparities and shocking outcomes in health, education and housing. That\u2019s why we set up the race and disparity unit in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cCovid-19 laid bare these structural inequalities in such Technicolor and made them worse, where [BAME communities] are dying in greater numbers, becoming severely ill in greater numbers, and losing their jobs. Then to be not only in denial, but saying: \u2018What are you complaining about? We live in a society that is much better than it was 100 years ago\u2019 is monumental disrespect and disregard of people\u2019s lived experiences, but above all a lost opportunity for systemic change.\u201d</p> <p>The report notes improvements such as increasing diversity in elite profession, a shrinking ethnicity pay gap and that children from many ethnic communities do as well or better than white pupils in compulsory education.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/974507/20210331_-_CRED_Report_-_FINAL_-_Web_Accessible.pdf\">258-page report</a> calls on the government to fully fund the Equality and Human Rights Commission, improve training for police officers and include a local residency requirement for recruitment. Within 24 recommendations it advocates establishing an office for health disparities, opening up access to apprenticeships, teaching an \u201cinclusive curriculum\u201d, and putting a stop to use of the term BAME.</p> <p>It also pushes for a move of focus away from institutions and more towards \u201cthe extent [that] individuals and their communities could help themselves through their own agency, rather than wait for invisible external forces to assemble to do the job\u201d.</p> <p>In an open rebuff to the arguments of the Black Lives Matter movement, and the protests that erupted after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">death of George Floyd in the US</a>, the report says the \u201cidealism\u201d of \u201cwell-intentioned young people\u201d claiming the dominant feature in society is institutional racism achieves little \u201cbeyond alienating the decent centre ground\u201d.</p> <p>The shadow women and equalities secretary, Marsha De Cordova, said: \u201cTo downplay institutional racism in a pandemic where black, Asian and ethnic minority people have died disproportionately and are now twice as likely to be unemployed is an insult.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to one of the most contentious passages in the report, which argues that a \u201cnew story\u201d needs to be told about the slave trade, which would highlight cultural transformation of African people, de Cordova said: \u201cThe government must urgently explain how they came to publish content which glorifies the slave trade, and immediately disassociate themselves with these remarks.\u201d</p> <p>The commission focuses significantly on education, which it describes as the single most emphatic success story of the British ethnic minority experience, where children from many ethnic communities do as well or better than white pupils, with black Caribbean students the only group to perform less well.</p> <p>NHS Providers said it disagreed with the report\u2019s conclusions and said there was \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d evidence that NHS ethnic minority staff have worse experiences and face more barriers than white counterparts, with deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery warning that denying the link between structural racism and health inequalities is \u201cdamaging\u201d.</p> <p>The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said the commission had \u201cchosen to deny the experiences of black and minority ethnic workers\u201d, adding that institutional racism trapped people in poverty, insecurity and low pay.</p> <p>The conclusion of the report notes that while most of the Black Lives Matters protesters are young, the bulk of the commission are from \u201can older generation whose views were formed by growing up in the 1970s and 1980s\u201d. But it states that because of the progress that has been made over the past 50 years \u201ca degree of optimism is justified\u201d.</p> <p>Sunder Katwala, the director of <a href=\"https://www.britishfuture.org/about-us/\">British Future</a>, said: \u201cBlack and Asian Britons in our society today face less prejudice than their parents or grandparents, they may well fare better than those in many other countries. But such comparisons make little difference to the lives of ethnic minority Britons in 2021.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s an important success story in education that can rightly be celebrated. But if a graduate in Manchester with an ethnic-sounding surname still gets fewer job interviews than a white classmate with the same CV, why should they feel lucky that the odds might be worse in Milan or Marseille?\u201d</p> <p>The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said he was disappointed by the findings from the summary of the report published, insisting there were structural problems that needed to be addressed.</p> <p>Rehana Azam, the GMB national secretary for public services, said: \u201cOnly this government could produce a report on race in the 21st century that actually gaslights Black, Asian, minority and ethnic people and communities. This feels like a deeply cynical report that not only ignores black and ethnic minority workers\u2019 worries and concerns but is part of an election strategy to divide working-class people and voters. It\u2019s completely irresponsible and immoral.\u201d</p> <p>The Institute of Race Relations said: \u201cFrom what we have seen, [the] reports fit neatly with the government\u2019s attempts, post-Brexit, to portray the British nation as a beacon of good race relations and a diversity model, in the report\u2019s words, for \u2018white majority countries\u2019 across the globe.\u201d</p>"

Arbery had been recorded on surveillance footage entering and leaving a semi-constructed house in the area, but no evidence has linked him to any offense.</p> <p>A scuffle occurred as the McMichaels, both carrying firearms, attempted to corner Arbery, who was unarmed, with their pickup truck. Travis McMichael then opened fire three times with a shotgun.</p> <p>On Tuesday, after 11 days of jury selection, a panel of 65 jurors was finally selected from a pool of hundreds. Barring any unforeseen delays, <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/jury-finally-qualified-for-trial-involving-arberys-killing/5C5XLUIGEVBI5DLDAT6O6LAR3E/\">including last-minute motions defense attorneys have suggested they will file</a>, a final jury of 12 and four alternates will be seated this week, with opening arguments to follow, probably on Thursday.</p> <p>The trial of the three men, who have pleaded not guilty, occurs six months after the conviction of Derek Chauvin, the white former police officer who murdered George Floyd in Minneapolis after pinning his neck to the ground for nine minutes and 29 seconds. That trial was undoubtedly a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2021/apr/22/george-floyd-a-landmark-moment-for-justice-in-america-video\">landmark moment for police reform advocates</a> around the country, but, say many observers, the case of Ahmaud Arbery is a sterner litmus test for the state of racial justice in the US.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16e53ee6a885249e82c63155b2197e62d272ef24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16e53ee6a885249e82c63155b2197e62d272ef24/0_0_5416_3610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Merritt, a lawyer representing the family of Ahmaud Arbery, by a mural in the likeness of Arbery painted by artist Theo Ponchaveli in Dallas, Texas on 9 May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Merritt, a lawyer representing the family of Ahmaud Arbery, stands by a mural in the likeness of Arbery painted by artist Theo Ponchaveli in Dallas, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Gutierrez/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis case is almost a straight line from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/emmett-till-long-wait-for-justice\">Emmett Till</a>,\u201d said the civil rights attorney Lee Merritt, who represents the Arbery family. \u201cOur legal system is statistically and continuously biased but it\u2019s more of a test than Minneapolis and George Floyd because we are in the heart of white supremacy here in south Georgia.\u201d</p> <p>Merritt\u2019s point was illustrated by the immediate surroundings.

City officials have said it will eventually be removed.</p> <p>But the legal particulars of this murder trial also point to history as well. The McMichaels\u2019 defense is expected to hinge on a now defunct Georgia law that traces its roots to the state\u2019s era of slavery and essentially allowed private citizens the power to arrest people if they had \u201creasonable and probable grounds of suspicion\u201d of a felony being committed.</p> <p>In the wake of mass protest following Arbery\u2019s death, Georgia\u2019s Republican governor repealed the law, but attorneys for all three defendants are expected to utilize it throughout the trial.</p> <p>\u201cThey changed the law, but changing the law doesn\u2019t affect us.

Barnhill, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/17/ahmaud-arbery-district-attorney-george-barnhill\">had a chequered history of aggressively prosecuting Black residents in his jurisdiction</a>, eventually recused himself from the case. Another former prosecutor initially assigned the case, Jackie Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/former-prosecutor-charged-ahmaud-arbery-case-booked-georgia-jail-n1278706\">has been criminally charged for alleged misconduct </a>in the process as Gregory McMichael had worked as an investigator in her office.</p> <p>The past two weeks have also highlighted the difficulties in impaneling a jury in this small rural county, composed of 69% white residents and 26% Black residents, and which <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/results/state/georgia\">voted 61% for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election</a>. Defense lawyers have argued many potential jurors have not shown up for jury duty as the court whittled the final number down to 65 people. Prospective jurors were questioned about their prior knowledge of the case, whether they had expressed support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and if they knew any of those involved.</p> <p>In a striking remark <a href=\"https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/crime/ahmaud-arbery/amaud-arberys-accused-killers-says-defendant-is-not-facing-a-jury-of-his-peers/77-1b728bba-9fa5-4d18-9cbe-ba9806337ac0\">on Friday last week</a> defense attorney Gough complained to the judge: \u201cIt would appear that white males born in the south over 40 years old without a college degree \u2026 which he might also be known as Bubba or Joe Sixpack \u2026 seem to be significantly underrepresented.\u201d</p> <p>Still, despite these hurdles, Merritt was explicit about his expectations for accountability in the case: \u201cWe expect convictions on all charges. These men should be in prison for the rest of their lives. That will get us on the road to justice.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Among the small group of activists seated on the grass outside the courthouse was 68-year-old Patricia Fields, from the nearby town of Waycross. Like Diane Arbery Jackson she too has come to the courthouse every day and, in a recent week, went to visit Satilla Shores, the small neighborhood where Arbery was killed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s eerie there,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like there\u2019s a shadow over it. That something is just not right.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a53878c30cf14f0cee9b4cc376722c1f47162bb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a53878c30cf14f0cee9b4cc376722c1f47162bb5/0_0_3594_2396/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People participate in a protest outside the Glynn county courthouse in Brunswick, Georgia on 8 May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People participate in a protest outside the Glynn county courthouse in Brunswick, Georgia, on 8 May 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On a trip earlier this week few residents of Satilla Shores wanted to speak about the Arbery murder case. Along neatly kept lawns, a number of houses still display Trump 2020 presidential campaign placards and a golf cart was daubed in a sign that read: \u201cImpeach Biden\u201d. There is no memorial or marker at the site where Arbery was gunned down.</p> <p>For a case that is tied so deeply to atrocities of the past, the murder of Ahmaud Arbery is also closely linked to prosecutions from recent memory.</p> <p>The presence of eyewitness video, filmed by Bryan as he took part in the pursuit from behind, is set to play a pivotal role in the case. It took months for the footage to emerge, as the case sat in relative obscurity away from the gaze of most national media. The absence of publicly available footage undoubtedly contributed to the initial decision not to indict the three men now standing trial. It was not until the video was made public that the case was handed to Georgia state investigators who promptly recommended charges against the accused.</p> <p>In the same way that Darnella Frazier\u2019s eyewitness video of the murder of George Floyd thrust the incident into global consciousness and played a pivotal role at the trial of Derek Chauvin, so too does this footage hold the key to the case.</p> <p>The trial also bears striking similarities to the prosecution of George Zimmerman, charged with the murder of the unarmed Black teenager Trayvon Martin in the neighboring state of Florida in 2012. Zimmerman, a volunteer neighborhood watchman who shot and killed Martin after chasing him down for \u201csuspicious\u201d activity, was acquitted at trial claiming self-defense under stand your ground statutes \u2013 a similar line of argument tied to self-defense that the McMichaels are likely to make at trial.</p> <p>Crucially, however, there was no witness video in the Zimmerman trial.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Diane Arbery Jackson ate lunch on the lawn; shrimp, corn and grilled potatoes, donated to the small group of activists by a local racial justice coalition. She told the Guardian of her fondest memories of her nephew, whose death prompted the state of Georgia to ratify its first hate crime statute <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/26/884003927/after-ahmaud-arberys-killing-georgia-gov-signs-hate-crimes-legislation\">in June last year</a>.</p> <p>\u201cHe always showed love to everybody,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time he sees you, he always gives you a kiss. \u2018I love you,\u2019 he always said. \u2018I\u2019m good.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She described her family\u2019s history in Brunswick, which dated back to beyond the civil rights era. Her father and grandmother had marched in the 1960s, she said and were beaten by white residents.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to keep doing this, so we can keep going where they left off at. We have to come together as a community and continue the fight.\u201d</p>"

The WNBA was doing it before it was cool</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are incredibly proud of WNBA players who continue to lead with their inspiring voices and effective actions in the league\u2019s dedicated fight against systemic racism and violence,\u201d said the WNBA commissioner, Cathy Engelbert. \u201cWorking together with the WNBPA and the teams, the league aims to highlight players\u2019 social justice efforts throughout the 2020 season and beyond.

It means he will not face a federal trial in January, though he could end up spending more years behind bars when a judge sentences him at a later date.</p> <p>Chauvin is charged with two counts of depriving Floyd of his rights for pinning his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck as the Black man was handcuffed and not resisting, and for failing to provide medical care to Floyd during the 25 May 2020 arrest that resulted in Floyd\u2019s death. Chauvin, who is white, has already been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">convicted</a> of state murder and manslaughter charges and is serving a sentence of 22 1/2 years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/20/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-george-floyd\">Derek Chauvin found guilty of murder of George Floyd</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As part of the plea deal, Chauvin also pleaded guilty to violating the rights of a then 14-year-old boy during a 2017 arrest in which he held the boy by the throat, hit him in the head with a flashlight and held his knee on the boy\u2019s neck and upper back while he was prone, handcuffed and not resisting.</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s arrest and death, which a bystander captured on cellphone video, sparked mass protests nationwide that called for an end to racial inequality and police mistreatment of Black people.</p> <p>Chauvin and three other former officers \u2013 Thomas Lane, J Kueng and Tou Thao \u2013 were indicted earlier this year on federal charges alleging they willfully violated Floyd\u2019s rights. A federal trial for the other three men still appears to be scheduled for January. They face state trial on aiding and abetting counts in March.</p> <p>To bring federal charges in deaths involving police, prosecutors must believe an officer acted under the \u201ccolor of law\u201d, or government authority, and willfully deprived someone of their constitutional rights. </p> <p>An accident, bad judgment or simple negligence on the officer\u2019s part isn\u2019t enough to support federal charges. Prosecutors have to prove the officer knew what they were doing was wrong in that moment but did it anyway.</p> <p>According to evidence in the state case against Chauvin, Kueng and Lane helped restrain the 46-year-old Floyd as he was on the ground \u2013 Kueng knelt on Floyd\u2019s back and Lane held down Floyd\u2019s legs. Thao held back bystanders and kept them from intervening during the 9 1/2-minute restraint, in which Floyd called for his mother and repeatedly told the officers that he could not breathe.</p> <p>All four former officers were charged broadly in federal court with depriving Floyd of his rights while acting under government authority, but the federal indictment broke down the counts even further.</p> <p>In the 2017 case involving the then-14-year-old boy, Chauvin wrote in the police report that the teen resisted arrest and after the teen, whom he described as 6-ft-2 and about 240lb, was handcuffed, Chauvin \u201cused body weight to pin\u201d him to the floor. The boy was bleeding from the ear and needed two stitches.</p> <p>That encounter was one of several mentioned in state court filings that prosecutors said showed Chauvin had used neck or head and upper body restraints seven times before dating back to 2014, including four times state prosecutors said he went too far and held the restraints \u201cbeyond the point when such force was needed under the circumstances\u201d.</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s killing reignited calls for police departments across the country to face much tighter scrutiny. However, in November, Minneapolis voters rejected the idea of replacing the city\u2019s police department with a new department of public safety. If the \u201cyes\u201d vote had won, the Minneapolis police department would have been replaced with a department run by a nominated commissioner who would be approved by the city council.</p> <p>The projected department would have used a \u201ccomprehensive public health approach\u201d outlined by the mayor and city council, along with the erasure of mandatory minimum police staffing from the city chargers.</p> <p>Opponents pushed back against the proposal, arguing that it would leave the communities already affected by violence more vulnerable.</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>"
