Another display of diversity with neoliberal leaders, and another white backlash soon to come. Yet this time might be a turning point.&nbsp;</p> <p>The undeniable barbaric death&nbsp;of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/fires-light-up-washington-dc-on-third-night-of-george-floyd-protests\">George Floyd</a>, the inescapable vicious realities of the unequal misery of the coronavirus, the massive unemployment at Depression levels and the wholesale collapse of the legitimacy of political leadership (in both parties) are bringing down the curtain on the American empire.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">The answer to police violence is not 'reform'. It's defunding. Here's why  | Alex S Vitale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The increasing militarization of US society is inseparable from its imperial policies (211 deployments of US armed forces in 67 countries since 1945). The militaristic response to the killing of Floyd tells a story&nbsp;of oversized police presence, unprovoked assaults and excessive force. Ironically, the misleading debate over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/george-floyd-protesters-condemn-opportunistic-looting-violence\">rioters v protesters</a> and outside agitators v legitimate local citizens turns attention away from&nbsp;how heavy law enforcement presence fuels disrespect for the police. The stark contrast of the police response to rightwing provocateurs who show up inside and outside state capitols with guns and loaded ammunition looms large.</p> <p>I recall my own experience of protesting in Charlottesville, Virginia, against hundreds of masked, armed Nazis with live ammunition in which the police stepped back and remained still and silent as we were mercilessly attacked. Without the intervention and protection of antifa, some of us would have died. Sister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/01/heather-heyers-mother-on-hate-in-the-us-were-not-going-to-hug-it-out-but-we-can-listen-to-each-other\">Heather Heyer</a> did die. I believe the attack on any innocent person is wrong, but the focus on the protesters\u2019 assaults on persons or property takes our attention away from the police killing of hundreds of black, poor and working-class people.</p> <p>It also obscures the role of the repressive apparatus in preserving an order so unjust and cruel. The rule of big money, class and gender hierarchies and global militarism must be highlighted in our profound concern with anti-black police murder and brutality.</p> <p>The four catastrophes Martin Luther King Jr warned us about \u2013&nbsp;militarism (in Asia, Africa and the Middle East), poverty (at record levels), materialism (with narcissistic addictions to money, fame and spectacle) and racism (against black and indigenous people, Muslims, Jews and non-white immigrants) \u2013&nbsp;have laid bare the organised hatred, greed and corruption in the country. The killing machine of the US military here and abroad has lost its authority. The profit-driven capitalist economy has lost its glow. And the glitz of the market-driven culture (including media and education) are more and more hollow.&nbsp;</p> <p>The fundamental question at this moment is: can this failed social experiment be reformed? The political duopoly of an escalating neofascist Donald Trump-led Republican party and a fatigued Joe Biden-led neoliberal Democratic party \u2013&nbsp;in no way equivalent, yet both beholden to Wall Street and the Pentagon \u2013&nbsp;are symptoms of a decadent leadership class. The weakness of the labor movement and the present difficulty of the radical left to unite around a nonviolent revolutionary project of democratic sharing and redistribution of power, wealth and respect are signs of a society unable to regenerate the best of its past and present.&nbsp;Any society that refuses to eliminate or attenuate dilapidated housing, decrepit school systems, mass incarceration, massive unemployment and underemployment, inadequate healthcare and its violations of rights and liberties is undesirable and unsustainable.</p> <p>Yet the magnificent moral courage and spiritual sensitivity of the multiracial response to the police killing of George Floyd that now spills over into a political resistance to the legalized looting of Wall Street greed, the plundering of the planet and the degradation of women and LGBTQ+ peoples means we are still fighting regardless of the odds.&nbsp;</p> <p>If radical democracy dies in America, let it be said of us that we gave our all-and-all as the boots of American fascism tried to crush our necks.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Cornel West is an American philosopher, author, critic, actor, civil rights activist and leading member of Democratic Socialists of America</p></li> </ul>"

It invades all sense of comprehensive thought with a primal and terrifying urgency. Surrounded by gas and the chatter of rubber bullet guns, and the ominous thrum of officers beating their riot shields with batons, the burning becomes more like a vice grip around your throat. It feels possible you may die there on the pavement in a cloud of smoke, possible you may call out for your mother, or more likely: \u201cMilk! Milk, please!\u201d</p> <p>You won\u2019t be able to process quickly enough who approaches you, pulling off your shirt. They remove your contacts so you don\u2019t go blind, then pour milk or Maalox in your eyes. By some miracle, this transaction provides relief for a few moments, then you must get back on your feet and run from police batons and elbows and knees again, though you are just starting to catch your breath.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/26/violence-kenosha-wisconsin-longstanding-tension-police-people-color-jacob-blake\">'Far from isolated incident': Kenosha's Black residents speak out on police violence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the 100 days since George Floyd\u2019s death, police have replied to mass protests with chemical weaponry and repression tactics, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/27/kenosha-community-jacob-blake-shooting\">most recently in Kenosha</a>, Wisconsin. As this violence against largely peaceful protesters seems to have no end in sight, it scares me that when we talk about teargas, we don\u2019t talk about burning mouths and blinded eyes. It scares me that the bones broken by the fists and batons of police are \u201csustained non-lethal injuries\u201d, not gruesome, splintered bones. And, officials offended by charged terms such as kidnapping would like us to instead use the term \u201clawful detainments\u201d. But under federal and state law, kidnapping is commonly defined as the unlawful transportation and confinement of a person against their will.</p> <p>By that definition, John Parks was kidnapped by police and armed federal forces on 29 July in Portland, Oregon. \u201cI was surrounded by men in camo, and black,\u201d he told me, with tense inflection, \u201cThey put me in the back of an unmarked vehicle and refused to tell me why I was being detained.\u201d</p> <p>Parks is, by his own words, an unmistakable figure in the movement, \u201cI wear a blue and black helmet, I dress eclectically, and I have severe burn scars on the larger parts of my body.\u201d The longtime local resident and activist was dragged into the back of a van by unidentifiable men at the height of the unrest, and after other <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/17/portland-protests-federal-arrests/\">kidnappings had been reported </a>and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/17/portland-protests-federal-arrests/\">one caught on video went viral</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to say I felt fear, because I didn\u2019t want to start freaking out. I had to keep a level head,\u201d he said. \u201c [One of the federal officers] was looking at me, in my eyes, while I asked him questions. He was just silent. Silent.\u201d</p> <p>I remember that same silence from my own kidnapping.</p> <p>In 2014, after the murder of Michael Brown, I slept very little and stayed in the streets of my community, rising to a considerable level of leadership and visibility when I was only 19 as part of a Black-led racial justice collective. I was the youngest of the lead organizers, sometimes the loudest. We\u2019d gathered during the largest national Black Friday sales disruption at the height of the initial Black Lives Matter uprising, following the grand jury\u2019s decision not to indict the officer who murdered Brown.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I kept my feet braced on a cold metal bench and sang freedom songs to steel my nerves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I remember being excited that so many were joining us at the die-in that day. I remember ensuring folks that our die-in was an inherently peaceful gathering, and some people had brought their children along to participate in civil disobedience.</p> <p>But, to my surprise, dozens of cops showed up. Some were heard saying, \u201cThat\u2019s not her, not her,\u201d as they stepped over the bodies of other participants, then found their way to me.</p> <p>I was forced into the back of a police wagon where I was kept alone and, save my cuffed wrists, unrestrained as the wagon drove wildly all over the city for nine hours. I kept my feet braced on a cold metal bench and sang freedom songs to steel my nerves. Once, officers parked the wagon in what looked like a vacant loading dock and played music loudly while making lewd references to my body and the holes in my shirt. When I sang, they laughed, and it took everything not to cry in fear and rage. That is all I can remember; brief snapshots of a long night I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d survive. Eventually, I was turned over to the Atlanta Detention Center. I was never formally charged.</p> <p>Maybe decontextualized, my ride with multiple officers of the law, who made veiled threats and lewd comments about my body and the holes in my shirt, let their hands linger on the small of my back, and sat me in the dark backside of an abandoned loading dock, maybe all of that isn\u2019t as terrifying on paper as it was in real life. But the context, of course, is that we live in a country where Black people\u2019s bodies are brutalized for the most mundane things. I was a Black woman in the hands of police against the context of thousands of <a href=\"http://cnn.com/2018/10/19/us/police-sexual-assaults-maryland-scope/index.html\">women accusing police</a> of sexual assault in the past decade. The context is that our nation was roiling then and is roiling still with the righteous fury of protesters and the indignant rage of bigots in and out of uniform.</p> <p>Police abductions are not lawful detainments; they are targeted attempts to intimidate activists and communities organizing to end policing as we know it.</p> <p>\u201cI feel proud of Portland,\u201d John Parks tells me. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing. People keep showing the fuck up.\u201d</p> <p>None of us asked to be where we are: fighting an overwhelmingly uphill battle toward abolition and equity, even as fascism takes a hold on the highest seat in the nation. But we are here. Though the cameras have moved on to the other federal scandals that plague the American public,<a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/08/portland-protests-continue-for-85th-night-heres-what-you-should-know.html\"> protests continue day and night</a>. Not just in Portland, but in<a href=\"https://www.wave3.com/2020/08/13/black-lives-matter-holds-midnight-rally-fischers-home-stage-other-direct-actions-overnight/\"> Louisville</a>, in<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/15/us/far-right-rally-proud-boys-michigan/index.html\"> Kalamazoo</a>, and countless other cities around the country. We were just called to action, yet again, in Kenosha.</p> <p>Police abduction of activists should always be a headline, always treated like a state-sanctioned threat. This act is a malignant tactic employed by local and federal governments, on an issue most central to what we are fighting for: Black lives. The freedom to be considered valuable and treated as such by our peers and this nation. The freedom to live without fearing the violence of police terrorism. That is what we are fighting for. Fighting, despite what police across the country are doing to deter us.</p>"

     "body": "<p>It was October 1991 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/sep/22/brett-kavanaugh-christine-blasey-ford-anita-hill-clarence-thomas-senate-judiciary-committee\">Anita Hill was testifying against Clarence Thomas</a>. At the judge\u2019s US supreme court confirmation hearing, Hill, his former aide, claimed he had sexually harassed her. Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw was assisting Hill\u2019s legal team and felt dejected and exhausted. As she left the capitol building in Washington DC that day, she saw a group of African Americans, mostly women, gathered at the bottom of the steps in a prayer circle. She let out a sigh of relief and walked towards them.</p> <p>\u201cI thought: \u2018Oh, thank God, a place we can go and embrace each other, because this is a struggle,\u2019\u201d Crenshaw says. It was the day before Thomas\u2019 confirmation, and she felt the future of the civil rights movement was on the line. But when she reached the group, she saw they were wearing T-shirts proclaiming their support for Thomas. She watched with dread as they sang songs of praise and called Hill a jezebel. \u201cIt was like a horror film,\u201d she says. \u201cYou think you\u2019re safe, but it turns out that the people you\u2019re running to are actually infected with whatever you\u2019re running from.\u201d</p> <p>As she walked away from them, she thought about how the case exposed the theoretical gap in the legal profession when it came to black women\u2019s lived experience. During the explosive hearing, televised and watched across the country, Hill, then a teacher at the University of Oklahoma\u2019s law school, spoke in great detail of her allegation that Thomas harassed her when he was her supervisor at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Yet he retained tremendous support \u2013 and, in his infamous defence, called the hearings a \u201chi-tech lynching\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6fd01a443ac97b6c91c38449e304d5dd7b3fe72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6fd01a443ac97b6c91c38449e304d5dd7b3fe72/758_45_3385_2031/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anita Hill and Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw in February\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018So many people were corralled by the idea that sexual harassment isn\u2019t a black woman\u2019s issue\u2019 ... Anita Hill and Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachel Murray/Getty Images for Makers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What Crenshaw saw was that, with feminists supporting Hill and anti-racist activists defending Thomas, twin calls for equality were being put in opposition to each other. The groups were weakening each other\u2019s movements instead of supporting each other\u2019s cause \u2013 and it was black women who paid a significant price. </p> <p>For Crenshaw, who is now one of the most influential black feminist legal theorists in the US, Hill\u2019s case cemented her idea of \u201cintersectionality\u201d, set out in a paper two years before the hearing. The idea suggests that different forms of discrimination \u2013 such as sexism and racism \u2013 can overlap and compound each other in just this way. At the time of Hill\u2019s case, Crenshaw was writing another paper, <a href=\"https://www.racialequitytools.org/resourcefiles/mapping-margins.pdf\">Mapping the Margins</a>, on the erasure of black women\u2019s history of being sexually harassed and abused. The Hill case showed the result of the fact that sexual harassment had largely only been discussed in relation to white women<strong>.</strong></p> <p>\u201cSo many people were corralled by the idea that sexual harassment isn\u2019t a black woman\u2019s issue,\u201d she says. \u201cSo many people didn\u2019t understand that slavery was about institutionalised sexual harassment and abuse. There were 700,000 slaves in 1790; by the eve of the civil war, there were nearly 4 million. How did that happen? It\u2019s right in front of us and there are no words for it.\u201d</p> <p>Her paper set out how feminism had failed to \u201canalyse that race was playing a role in making some women vulnerable to heightened patterns of sexual abuse. And it was also the case that anti-racism wasn\u2019t very good at dealing with that issue either.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"13bb35c82719ba18e8ce6611f31e7e5dfabdb23a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13bb35c82719ba18e8ce6611f31e7e5dfabdb23a/0_0_3100_2067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Crenshaw speaks at the Women\u2019s March in Los Angeles in January 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018These are the stories that a male-centric view of anti-black racism does not consistently remember, rehearse and retell\u2019 ... Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw at the Women\u2019s March in Los Angeles in January 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sipa USA/PA Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hill\u2019s case, Crenshaw believes, was also a painful example of the failure of representation for representation\u2019s sake. Thomas, the supreme court\u2019s only black justice, played a decisive role in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/25/shelby-county-anniversary-voting-rights-act-consequences\">gutting the Voting Rights Act in 2013</a>. The ruling struck down the system that blocked<strong> </strong>discriminatory voting policies before<em> </em>they harmed voters.</p> <p>Crenshaw\u2019s early academic work, meanwhile, was also an important building block in the development of critical race theory, which revolutionised the understanding of race in the US\u2019s legal system and is taught in law schools across the country. The heads of the University of California\u2019s law schools <a href=\"https://law.ucla.edu/news/joint-statement-deans-university-california-law-schools-about-value-critical-race-theory-0\">explained in September how useful it was in unpicking</a> \u201chow race has operated in our history and our present\u201d and understanding the structural racism through which racial inequality is reproduced in \u201ceconomic, political and educational systems even without individual racist intent\u201d. (Crenshaw is a professor at one of the schools, UCLA Law, and at Columbia Law School.)</p> <p>In the 30 years since Crenshaw first wrote about intersectionality, the term has swept to the forefront of conversations about feminism and racial justice. It is used by activists, in HR training in some of the world\u2019s largest corporations \u2013 and is at the heart of the rightwing backlash against identity politics. At the end of October, the term critical race theory <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/23/uk-critical-race-theory-trump-conservatives-structural-inequality\">was spoken in the UK parliament for the first time</a>, when Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, announced the government was \u201cunequivocally against\u201d fundamental parts of the concept.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My mom was more confrontational and my father was more Martin Luther King ... there are strains of both in my work</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In some ways, Crenshaw is excited by the high profile her theories have gained, even if they are being condemned: \u201cIt is far better that is circulating and being used than if only 25 law professors have read it.\u201d In September, Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/04/trump-antiracism-training-white-privilege-critical-race-theory\">ordered federal agencies to stop racial sensitivity training</a>, labelling it \u201cdivisive, anti-American propaganda\u201d. Crenshaw is happy to have the fight and point out how absurd this argument is. \u201cSo, what are you saying American is \u2013 <em>having</em> structural racism? If contesting it [racism] is un-American, then you are basically a witness to my side,\u201d she says. \u201cYou are confirming why this work is so important.\u201d</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Crenshaw backed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the election: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to describe Biden and Harris as being heaven in America to oppose the hell of a Trump administration.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.aapf.org/post/a-historic-night-in-american-history\">In a statement</a>, she described their win as a \u201chistoric night\u201d, thanks to Harris becoming the highest-ranking woman in US history, as well as the first black person and the first Indian American to become vice-president. Crenshaw noted that Biden\u2019s victory speech thanked the African American community, writing: \u201cWe must hold him to that promise \u2026 And we must move forward intersectionally, and with an eye towards our past.\u201d</p> <p>Crenshaw knew from a young age that she wanted to be a lawyer. When she was six, she was sent to church with her 14-year-old brother. It was summer and her dad told them to stay together. But her brother wanted to leave early and use their collection money to buy sweets. They took their time walking home, enjoying the goodies, not realising their parents would go to the church to pick them up. When Crenshaw got home and saw her parents were not there, it was clear there would be trouble.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0388b10f2bbcdbb9d9d021c5344b8b80f2913fee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0388b10f2bbcdbb9d9d021c5344b8b80f2913fee/0_0_6720_3915/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An activist at the Women\u2019s March in Washington DC in January 2019 holds a placard bearing a quote by Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw\" width=\"1000\" height=\"583\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Influential thinker ... an activist at the Women\u2019s March in Washington DC in January 2019 holds a placard bearing a quote by Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Newscom/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, she says, \u201cit never occurred to me in a million years that I would get in trouble, because I was following his orders.\u201d She argued to her dad that this was in a lose-lose situation for her: she was in trouble for following her brother\u2019s rules, but she would also have been in trouble if she had not gone with him. In the end, her father told everyone: \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t let her get a word in edgewise. When she starts to talk, you will not know what you were trying to say.\u2019 And that\u2019s when they started calling me a lawyer.\u201d</p> <p>Crenshaw was born on 5 May 1959 in Canton, Ohio, a small industrial town in the midwest. Her mother\u2019s side of the family were heavily involved with the desegregation movement (her mother helped desegregate a paddling pool at the age of three), while her father\u2019s side had a more spiritual advocacy for racial justice. \u201cMy mom was a little bit more radical and confrontational and my father was a little bit more Martin Luther King and \u2018find common ground\u2019. Which is probably why there are strains of both of those in my work.\u201d</p> <p>She remembers watching the civil rights movement explode across the country on her TV as she was growing up. Seeing a big, collective effort to change black people\u2019s trajectory in the country shaped her identity. Her parents, who were both teachers, kept her on her toes. \u201cI remember being teased by my friends because, when we got called in for dinner, we had to come to the table with something to say about what another day on the planet was, what did we learn and what happened,\u201d Crenshaw says. Inevitably, she liked to turn the tables and question her parents on their day.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If contesting racism is un-American, then you are basically a witness to my side</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At one point, she was sent to a Christian fundamentalist school that had smaller classes and better grades. It was a horrible experience. One teacher told her that civil rights activists were not God-fearing and were, in fact, the people the Bible warned about in Revelation. \u201cIt was like now, when people say Black Lives Matter protesters are thugs,\u201d Crenshaw says. But it also sharpened her skills in challenging authority \u2013 and, to the discomfort of some teachers, the exceptionally bright Crenshaw represented the school in debating and spelling competitions.</p> <p>She could handle being in conflict with her teachers, but struggled when another pupil called her the N-word and isolated her from her friends. \u201cIt was the first time I had seen abject racism from a kid my age,\u201d Crenshaw says. \u201cThat hurt more than any of the crazy stuff the teachers were doing.\u201d She begged her mum to pull her out; she transferred to the local school at which her mum taught.</p> <p>She went on to study at Cornell University in 1981, then got a law degree at Harvard law school in 1984 and a master\u2019s in law at the University of Wisconsin the following year. It was within the critical legal studies \u2013 a movement of legal scholars founded in the late 70s that dissected the idea that the law was just and neutral \u2013 that Crenshaw developed her ideas of critical race theory and intersectionality.</p> <p>Those ideas \u2013 which she felt were obvious to everyone who had experienced racism and sexism \u2013 were controversial among some leftwing legal academics. \u201cThere were some folks who felt that the loose network could not survive centring a race project inside of it,\u201d she says. Crenshaw\u2019s work asked people to think of the privileges they brought into a space and how, through their actions or silences, they contributed to the problem of racism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8efef9b911c6516326d4c6c2f0f2fe854a66842f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8efef9b911c6516326d4c6c2f0f2fe854a66842f/0_0_2400_1350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters march through Louisville, Kentucky, after a grand jury decided not to bring homicide charges against police officers involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The legal system\u2019s rendered judgment was that no one would be held accountable\u2019 ... protesters march through Louisville, Kentucky, after a grand jury brought no charges against the city\u2019s police for the killing of Breonna Taylor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lawrence Bryant/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because of this, it is often criticised<strong> </strong>as somehow undermining the building of a multiracial working-class movement. In response, Crenshaw argues that the US will never be able to respond to the problem of class until it interrogates what she describes as the politically stabilising role of white supremacy in propping up American hierarchies. \u201cThat has been the case since slavery. Why did so many white farmers who were impoverished by this economic system make themselves available, amenable, even champions of an economic system that didn\u2019t benefit them?\u201d</p> <p>She points to a documentary about a white Klansman who said that, although he did not have much, he thanked God every day for being white. \u201cWhy is that more important than the fact that he can\u2019t put food on the table?\u201d Crenshaw asks. \u201cWhen people tell me that intersectionality marginalises class, I say no, intersectionality is what we need to understand why it\u2019s been so difficult to mount a fully class-centric movement.\u201d</p> <p>Away from the classroom and courts, Crenshaw co-founded the African American Policy Forum, now one of the country\u2019s leading social justice thinktanks. <em> </em>In 2015<em>, </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/30/sayhername-why-kimberle-crenshaw-is-fighting-for-forgotten-women\">it created the hashtag </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/30/sayhername-why-kimberle-crenshaw-is-fighting-for-forgotten-women\">#</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/30/sayhername-why-kimberle-crenshaw-is-fighting-for-forgotten-women\">SayHerName</a> to highlight how black women were being overlooked as victims of police violence. As a longtime campaigner against police brutality against black women, Crenshaw was initially disappointed with the response to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/25/breonna-taylor-family-speak-about-police-killings-after-jury-decision-we-are-never-safe\">the killing of Breonna Taylor</a> by police in March in a botched narcotics raid, which has since received nationwide attention. \u201cHer name didn\u2019t really get lifted up until after George Floyd was killed,\u201d she says. \u201cHad <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/17/ahmaud-arbery-murder-suspects-plead-not-guilty\">Ahmaud Arbery</a> and George Floyd not been killed, would we be saying the name of Breonna Taylor?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"26d95dd9d394081e823beebb5da11614cbb082f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26d95dd9d394081e823beebb5da11614cbb082f1/0_0_2143_3000/714.jpg\" alt=\"Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw\" width=\"714\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Would I join the supreme court? After I take my ice skates off, having skated across hell\u2019 ... Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Cheung/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nonetheless, Taylor\u2019s death could be a turning point for the civil rights movement in the US, Crenshaw says. It could \u201cbecome the door through which people can see all of the other sisters who\u2019ve come before her. That would be a shift in consciousness and awareness about how black women can be thought of and seen as the subject of anti-black violence,\u201d Crenshaw says.</p> <p>She compares the killing of Taylor to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/emmett-till-long-wait-for-justice\">the lynching of 14-year-old Emmett Till in 1955</a>. Taylor\u2019s death, and the deaths of black women in general, has not \u201cmobilised an entire movement, an entire way of thinking about anti-black racism, in the way they say that Emmett Till\u2019s killing did\u201d. But, she says, \u201cwhat draws them together is that, as far as the legal system is concerned, its rendered judgment was that no one would be held accountable for either of these deaths\u201d.</p> <p>Crenshaw sees her work as an important recalibration of how the black struggle is understood. \u201cRosa Parks came into politics not when she sat down on a bus, but when she took up the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/29/recy-taylor-alabama-dies\">Recy Taylor</a>, a black woman who was gang-raped, and the white men who did it were not brought to justice. These are the stories that a male-centric view of anti-black racism does not consistently remember, rehearse and retell,\u201d Crenshaw says. This results in a failure to challenge the myth that black women don\u2019t face sexual and state violence, leaving women like Recy and Breonna Taylor vulnerable and isolated. For Crenshaw, this rewriting of history that centres the violence black women experience is crucial for taking the black freedom struggle forward.</p> <p>With the confirmation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/17/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-america\">Amy Coney Barrett</a> to the supreme court, Crenshaw says people are finally beginning to see how intimately the issues they care about are connected to the courts. In many ways, her career started at the US\u2019s highest court. Would she accept a nomination to be on the court? She laughs. \u201cI would do it, after I take my ice skates off, having skated across hell.\u201d</p>"

He claims that Quinn has \u201ccreated the votive statue to appropriation\u201d and it should have been \u201ca black artist\u2019s output, not that of a white cis man\u201d. This is reactionary politics disguised in obscure, trendy jargon.</p> <p>The core values of all progressive movements are liberty, equality and solidarity.

Similarly, we don\u2019t need to be black Americans to oppose the endless police brutality meted out to them.</p> <p>Our empathy lies with the exploited and oppressed. Price offers the worst kind of identity politics, where solidarity is impossible because only direct personal experience counts. That would be a disastrous dead end for Black Lives Matter and for all other social movements, while making broader alliances on social justice all but impossible. At a moment when the hard right is busy and active stirring up social divisions and cultural wars, progressives need to oppose those who unwittingly help them.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Jon Bloomfield</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Birmingham</em></p> <p>\u2022 I went to see the statue of Jen Reid and was horrified, when I got there, to realise I was six hours too late. People kept arriving hoping to see the statue too, but only a void now occupies that plinth.</p> <p>Marvin Rees, the Labour mayor of Bristol, may believe that the statue\u2019s removal has squashed the issue. But removing it has highlighted a key issue of the Black Lives Matter campaign. It suggests that black people are invisible, an underclass who do not have recognition. That racism is unheard.</p> <p>A savvy mayor would have left Quinn\u2019s statue there until Bristol city council had decided what could go in its place. There should have been a recognition of the pain and hurt rather than some petty excuse that the artist was not Bristolian. Here in Bristol we know how long it takes for the council to make decisions about controversial statues \u2013 Colston\u2019s statue was erected 60 years after abolition, was up for more than 100, and despite 30 years campaigning was only removed through passionate opposition to injustice. If treated the same, the Jen Reid statue would have stood for decades. The empty plinth says more than if the statue had remained. It says we cannot upset the racists. It says black lives are invisible.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Lyn Howard</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Bristol</em></p> <p>\u2022 I find the swift removal of the Jen Reid statue by Bristol city council regrettable, but it will not be forgotten, and serves to remind us that temporary works of art can be just as memorable as permanent ones. For example, Rachel Whiteread\u2019s House or the wonderful installations by Christo and Jeanne-Claude. The latter took years to come to fruition due to planning permits, financing etc, but the swift creation and erection of Quinn\u2019s statue suggests that a series of temporary works could be commissioned, as on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square, with a variety of artists (black, white, male, female, LGBTQ+) and subjects (local activists, historical figures, abstract symbols) chosen and voted for by local residents.</p> <p>This should satisfy the Bristol mayor\u2019s insistence on democratic process, create opportunities for a range of artists, and lead to genuine public involvement and engagement with quickly achieved results.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"> <strong>Clive Sykes</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"> <em>London</em></p>"

The historically working-class Irish-Catholic neighborhood has recently seen an influx of new, younger residents move in.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cI am absolutely not surprised this happened,\u201d said Noel Cazenave, a sociologist at the University of Connecticut and author of Killing African Americans: Police and Vigilante Violence as a Racial Control Mechanism.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cRace relations have been very intense in Philadelphia,\u201d said Cazenave, who lived in the city for 13 years. \u201cWhen my family and I drove down to try to find housing in Philadelphia, let\u2019s just say we had some interesting encounters in the north-east.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0617b81f-5431-457d-b963-3e057fc1b578\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gfIWyPgE_E0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Amid nationwide protests against police brutality and systemic racism against black Americans, a gathering of white vigilantes sends a chilling message. \u201cWe need to recognize that what\u2019s happening with the police and vigilantes is closely related,\u201d he said. \u201cSlave patrols and vigilante committees made the earliest roots of the American policing system.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Vigilantes and neighborhood watchers don\u2019t have to hurt or kill black people \u2013 as they did in the cases of Ahmaud Arbery and Philando Castile \u2013 in order to spark fear, Cazenave explained.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cChasing someone with golf clubs or what have you \u2013 I\u2019d say that is a form of non-lethal lynching that maintains white racial control,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sends a message that states: You\u2019re not supposed to be in this area. It\u2019s justified by the notion that black people, no matter what they\u2019re doing, are criminals.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, protesters convened outside Philadelphia\u2019s 26th police precinct, where the armed men had gathered the night before.

As part of this commitment, and based on your feedback, we have decided to remove the ethnicity filter from our next release.\u2063\u201d</p> <p>Grindr\u2019s filter had come under intense criticism over the weekend after&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Grindr/status/1266448252011872257\">a now-deleted tweet</a>&nbsp;from the company that read \u201cDemand Justice. #blacklivesmatter\u201d. Many condemned the company\u2019s show of solidarity as hollow when taken alongside the existence of a feature that allows users to explicitly discriminate based on race.</p> <p>The company has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/29/wltm-colour-blind-dating-app-racial-discrimination-grindr-tinder-algorithm-racism\">long maintained that the ethnicity filter</a>&nbsp;was useful for minority users who wanted to find people like themselves, rather than enforce racism.</p> <p>\u201cWe decided before we were ready to pull the plug on that, it was a conversation we wanted with our user base,\u201d Grindr\u2019s head of communications told the Guardian in 2018. \u201cWhile I believe the ethnicity filter does promote racist behaviour in the app, other minority groups use the filter because they want to quickly find other members of their minority community.\u201d</p> <p>Grindr isn\u2019t the only dating app which allows users to filter by race, but it is by far the most prominent. Racial discrimination on the app isn\u2019t simply enforced algorithmically, either; a 2015 study of Australian users found that 96% had seen at least one profile that included some form of racial discrimination, \u2018through language such as \u201cNot attracted to Asians.\u201d\u2019 One in eight of those surveyed admitted they themselves included such language.</p> <p>The announcement came on the first day of Pride month, Grindr noted. \u201cWe can still come together in the spirit of Pride, but Pride this year has an added responsibility, a shifted tone, and a new priority that will be reflected in our programming \u2013 support and solidarity for queer people of color and the #BlackLivesMatter movement.\u201d</p>"

Every time she tried to air her views, Ferrari\u2019s voice cut through hers. \u201cTina, Tina, Tina,\u201d Ferrari said in his trademark oleaginously patronising simper as if speaking to a dim child. Tina complained about him interrupting her, but Ferrari wouldn\u2019t be silenced. Taking down statues is illegal. End of. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d is a Black Lives Matter slogan. \u201cI can\u2019t get airtime\u201d might be Tina\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cTina, Tina, Tina\u201d, for me, had Thatcherite resonance.

There is one female presenter, the superbly intelligent Shelagh Fogarty, and one person of colour, the former Islamist who became David Cameron\u2019s anti-extremism adviser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/02/maajid-nawaz-how-a-former-islamist-became-david-camerons-anti-extremism-adviser\">Maajid Nawaz</a>, now the station\u2019s eviscerator-in-chief of dimwit callers.</p> <p>No wonder there have been reports of BAME staff, and quite possibly anyone with a social conscience at LBC, having long been sickened by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage\">Nigel Farage</a>, who has been hosting his show five days a week since 2017. They will be pleased that the former Ukip leader\u2019s toxic demagoguery has finally received its comeuppance. This happened when Farage tweeted comparing Black Lives Matter protesters in Bristol who toppled the statue of Edward Colston to the Taliban. On ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, Farage clashed with host Piers Morgan over his comments and had his microphone muted as a result. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nigel-farage-leaves-lbc-show-black-lives-matter-taliban-comments-2020-6?r=US&amp;IR=T\">Sources at LBC told Business Insider</a> that there had been \u201cso much anger\u201d among staff about the station publicly endorsing the Black Lives Matter movement \u201cwhile promoting a man that likened it to the Taliban\u201d.</p> <p>LBC has long been too cosy with Farage\u2019s agenda, right down to gleefully plugging his exclusive interview with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>. I say interview, but it was more a case of Farage kneeling down, puckering up and smooching for an hour. The first principle of political interviewing is, as Jeremy Paxman argued: \u201cWhy is this lying bastard lying to me?\u201d Farage stands for a different kind of journalism, one that led Ofcom to investigate his show and one that LBC should have dispensed with years ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d664f72f08f2f61d428b7ffb277f3370b9f9213\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d664f72f08f2f61d428b7ffb277f3370b9f9213/1189_764_3523_2114/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kindly, intelligent albeit Tory persona ...

Three years ago, hate factory Katie Hopkins <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/may/26/katie-hopkins-leaves-lbc-radio-final-solution-tweet-manchester-attack\">lost her show on the station</a> after a tweet in which she called for a \u201cfinal solution\u201d following the Manchester Arena bombing.</p> <p>This has left more responsible presenters putting out fires. A year ago, Brexiteer Trevor rang in in the small hours of the morning to ask rhetorically: \u201cWhy the hell do we need Europe when Europe is filled up with black people who are raping?\u201d \u201cAt some point,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/darren-adam/darren-adam-brands-brexiteer-racist-turbulent-row/\">retorted presenter Darren Adam</a>, \u201cpeople who say a racist thing lose the right not to describe them as racist.\u201d</p> <p>After LBC showed Farage that leave means leave, token leftwing presenter James O\u2019Brien tweeted happily that he and his colleagues had got their station back. Perhaps, but that\u2019s not good enough. One evening last week, Denise from Enfield rang in to Iain Dale\u2019s show. Dale is having a good lockdown \u2013 his ratings are up and his kindly, intelligent, albeit Tory, persona has been soothing for many of us.</p> <p>Denise rang in to tell truth to power, namely that black people don\u2019t get chances for representation on TV and radio. Dale was so impressed by her insights into race issues that he invited her to cohost a show. The result was a revelation, not least because Denise was a natural for radio: warm-voiced, kind to callers and, like a pro, very aware of the need to cut people off before the ad break.</p> <p>Mostly, though, Denise\u2019s hour on LBC was a revelation because, finally, a white man was listening to a black woman. She told Dale: \u201cI think you can have empathy for a person\u2019s situation, you can also have sympathy because most people in the world are decent in terms of the day-to-day understanding. I\u2019m sorry, Iain, but you wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Good for Dale, opening the airwaves to Denise. He will now, apparently, do a four-hour show, taking in the 6-7pm evening slot previously filled by Farage. Why don\u2019t they just let Denise replace Farage? It would be a step in the right direction.</p>"

     "body": "<p>At the start of April, Dawn Butler was a well-liked figure in parliament and looked like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/28/labour-deputy-leader-trade-union-equality\">a strong candidate for deputy leader of the Labour party</a>. An experienced parliamentarian, 50 years old and a party member for more than 30 of them, she had been a minister in Gordon Brown\u2019s government and served in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet. In December 2009, she had been the first black woman to speak from the dispatch box. She also had strong union links, having worked for the GMB and, before that, the Public and Commercial Services Union. She had a life before \u2013 and halfway through \u2013 Westminster, working as a computer programmer and then an employment-service trainer.</p> <p>In February 2005, she stood to be a parliamentary candidate in West Ham, in the east London borough of Newham, where she was raised by her mother, who worked for the NHS, and her father, who worked on the railways. She lost that race by four votes. A month later, she went for Brent South, in north-west London, and got it, even though \u201cit had already been earmarked for Tony Blair\u2019s political adviser. That was like a red rag to a bull, wasn\u2019t it? It had already been stitched up for a bloke, so obviously I was going to go for it.\u201d That May, she won the seat in the general election.</p> <p>After boundary changes, she lost the newly minted seat of Brent Central to Sarah Teather in the 2010 Lib Dem bounce, only to be elected again \u2013 in the same constituency \u2013 in 2015, since when she has held the seat. She spent the intervening years designing learning programmes for companies and nursing her father in the last year of his life.</p> <p>On 3 April 2020, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/04/keir-starmer-wins-labour-leadership-election\">she lost the deputy leadership race to Angela Rayner</a> \u2013 about which she has views, which we will come to. Since then, she has been a backbencher, working in the same crisis conditions as everyone else. In June, <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/06/06/blame-government-coronavirus-12814284/\">she wrote an opinion piece</a> in the Metro newspaper defending the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter protests</a>. \u201cWe had 6,000 bits of communication and about 2,000 of them were hate communication,\u201d she says of the response. \u201cThere are people calling me every word you can think of \u2013 the C-word, the N-word, the B-world. People threatening to kill me. I\u2019ve been attacked on the tube. People have tried to attack me in my constituency office. A member of staff bought themselves a stab vest to come to my surgery.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de1c99415cb671ac127793035e087b5cb9972c02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de1c99415cb671ac127793035e087b5cb9972c02/0_0_1728_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dawn Butler in her days as a GMB organiser\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My parents taught me resilience\u2019 ... Butler in her days as a GMB organiser.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She had to close her constituency office because she could not guarantee her staff\u2019s safety. \u201cMy team had to wade through all this and basically grade [the messages], in terms of what Twitter might take down, or Facebook might take down, or the police might take seriously, or parliament might take seriously. And they were broken by all this. They\u2019re protecting me from the hate and I feel so guilty about it.\u201d</p> <p>We meet in her constituency, at the Arch, a deserted but intensely festive Indian restaurant in Wembley, where she is sitting in a cabana in the broadest sunshine, looking like a portrait of optimism. It is astonishing to hear, first-hand, about the racist abuse she has endured and to see the contrast between the grind of this nastiness and how undimmed she seems by it.</p> <p>She quickly and resolutely diverts from her own experience on to someone whom she thinks has it worse: Diane Abbott, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/05/diane-abbott-more-abused-than-any-other-mps-during-election\">the recipient of almost as much online abuse as all other female MPs combined</a>, according to research by Amnesty International in 2017. \u201cYou have people who\u2019ve made a career out of attacking Diane. What did she have to put up with when she entered parliament [in 1987]? What scars has she got, what did she have to do to keep the peace, how many times did she have to smile through it?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Whenever people of colour see a wrongful arrest or a killing, it brings back trauma</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are clear parallels in the way Abbott and Butler are treated, not just by political opponents and trolls on social media, but also by putatively respectable platforms. \u201cThey often try to dismiss what I\u2019m saying, then two or three weeks later everyone else is saying it and I\u2019m exonerated. A presenter said to me: did I read the government\u2019s report [on coronavirus], which was 50 pages. It was only 50 pages anyway because it had such a large font; if they\u2019d printed it at normal size, it would have been a pamphlet. And I was ridiculed for saying I hadn\u2019t. But I didn\u2019t need to read it \u2013 I\u2019d already read the science behind it. I\u2019m on the science and technology select committee.\u201d</p> <p>She says this portrayal \u2013 the idiot who is not on top of her brief \u2013 \u201cis a form of trolling. It\u2019s a trope. And it\u2019s racism. It\u2019s something that black women face all the time. We are simultaneously invisible and visible.\u201d This has persisted throughout her life in the public eye, even the most triumphant and historic moments of which have been marked by this kneejerk ridicule. When she stood up to speak on behalf of Brown\u2019s government, \u201cthe first black woman to stand at the dispatch box, the Tories tried to belittle me at that moment in history. I can\u2019t remember his name, but one took great delight in telling me that \u2018upskilling\u2019 was not in the English dictionary. He knew it was a momentous time, but they\u2019d all been instructed to put me down.\u201d</p> <p>But the person she remembers vividly from that day is Sadiq Khan, who was a transport minister at the time. \u201cHe ran from the other side of parliament to make sure he sat beside me. He was all out of breath. He said: \u2018I\u2019m not letting you do this by yourself.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"380e32cdb05dd11bc0d621a86ffc6925f3001b4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/380e32cdb05dd11bc0d621a86ffc6925f3001b4c/0_0_6285_4190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Butler (fourth left) on the March4Women in London in March 2018, alongside celebrities, activists and other politicians, including the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan (fifth left)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When I stood at the dispatch box, he ran from the other side of parliament to make sure he sat beside me\u2019 ...

The obvious assumption is that she made a strategic shift in her own politics to fit in with the new order, but the only sign of that in her voting record is that, early on, <a href=\"https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/11447/dawn_butler/brent_central/divisions?policy=975\">she voted consistently against an inquiry into the Iraq war</a>, which would have aligned her with the right of the party.</p> <p>She rejects that and gives a straightforward, personal reason for those votes: \u201cI never believed in holding an inquiry while we still had troops in Iraq. My brother was in the army and I spoke to him about it. If you held an inquiry while the troops were still out there doing their best to fight for the country, it would have been soul-destroying for them.\u201d</p> <p>Her analysis is that Labour moved rightwards after 2010: \u201cWhen I came back in 2015, I was a little bit surprised at the sorts of things that the Labour party was comfortable with, like the welfare reform bill [in which Harriet Harman, as interim leader, instructed MPs not to vote against Conservative cuts]. I didn\u2019t understand what had happened in my time away; I was only gone for five years. That\u2019s when I knew that Jeremy Corbyn was going to do well, because he knew who he was and what our values were as a party.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bab9f42d76a9f8829e9eb5d8ea76c79982b3379\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bab9f42d76a9f8829e9eb5d8ea76c79982b3379/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dawn Butler on Labour\u2019s front bench in October 2018 with Jeremy Corbyn, then the leader of the party, and Kate Osamor, then the shadow secretary for international development\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I knew that I had skills to contribute\u2019 ... on Labour\u2019s front bench in October 2018 with Jeremy Corbyn, then the leader of the party, and Kate Osamor, then the shadow secretary for international development.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Corbyn did not woo her into the shadow cabinet \u2013 she had to break down his door. \u201cHe had a lot of inexperienced people around him and that wasn\u2019t helping us. I knew that I could help him at PMQs; I knew that I had skills to contribute.\u201d Butler\u2019s critique of Corbyn\u2019s time is deeply felt, but quite careful. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/19/labour-party-financial-peril-keir-starmer-members-leaked-report\">The Labour leaked report</a> [into the party\u2019s handling of antisemitism, which described a closed inner circle around the leader, outside of which was a party so riven that staffers were actively hoping for electoral defeat] cut very deep. I was very bruised by that. The lesson is: you need people around you when you\u2019re in power who will question what you\u2019re doing, because you\u2019ll make better decisions.\u201d</p> <p>I ask, of course, whether she is glad of Keir Starmer\u2019s victory. \u201cI would have been glad whoever won.\u201d She dissolves into laughter and immediately concedes: \u201cThat\u2019s really a cop-out. Am I glad? Do you know what I think? I think the Labour party\u2019s leadership election system needs to change. I don\u2019t think you should be having an internal election that means you have to spend a lot of money.\u201d</p> <p>She then rattles off how much everything costs \u2013 \u00a35,000 to get access to the membership lists, \u00a313,000 to pay for the system to contact members by text, half a million for a mailout. \u201cI thought working 24 hours a day would be enough to win. But, actually, I needed money to access some of the systems that were needed. And I had 30 grand. Before the phone calls and mailouts started, I was in second place.\u201d In the event, Butler came last, on 11%.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The government is using the virus as a smokescreen for what\u2019s going to happen post-transition</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another interpretation is that her campaign did not get across who she is. She often used to come across as dry and cautious, with more than a trace of the disciplined minister of government, serious and liable to equivocate. That Butler has vanished: no longer bound by the responsibilities of the frontbench, she relishes the freedom to choose her own causes: \u201cThere are things that I need to speak out on that may make Keir feel uncomfortable.\u201d She also seems to have liberated her personality: funny, zealous, mischievous, pioneering.</p> <p>Her chosen causes are varied: she has a fairly geeky, careful eye on government procurement, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/25/the-uk-app-failure-sums-up-our-fatally-flawed-coronavirus-response\">the contact-tracing app</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/09/government-cancels-brexit-ferry-contract-with-no-ship-firm\">Chris Grayling\u2019s shipping contract with a company that had no ships</a>. She is viscerally worried about a bad or no-deal Brexit and what it will do to her constituents. \u201cI think a lot of what this government is doing is that they\u2019re using it [the virus] as a smokescreen for what\u2019s going to happen post-transition. And we really have to work hard at informing the public as to what\u2019s actually going on.\u201d</p> <p>And the Black Lives Matter movement \u2013 \u201cIt is a movement, not a moment,\u201d she says, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/06/keir-starmer-to-sign-up-for-unconscious-bias-training-amid-criticism\">referring to Starmer calling it the latter</a>, for which he later apologised \u2013 \u201chas got me thinking about all kinds of things. Whenever, in general, African-Caribbean people, people of colour, see an injustice taking place, a wrongful arrest or a killing, it brings back trauma, it makes you think of the stuff you\u2019ve been through, or your family has been through. My parents taught me resilience, but it was their resilience. My brothers taught me resistance, how to survive. So they would say to me: \u2018When you\u2019re driving, if a police car drives past you, look in the mirror, see if it turns around to follow you. If it does, stop somewhere where there are people.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"874f0a0fb9a75ad4bc10becf978dce436befef73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/874f0a0fb9a75ad4bc10becf978dce436befef73/0_113_4513_2708/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dawn Butler campaigning in Durham in February for deputy leader of the Labour party\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I thought working 24 hours a day would be enough to win\u2019 ... campaigning in Durham in February for deputy leader of the Labour party.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is stark to hear, in such concrete terms, the coping strategies that people of colour have developed to counter institutional racism. Butler continues: \u201cThere are loads of people who are, for the first time, understanding the injustice that African-Caribbean people go through. They\u2019re seeing things they never saw before. There are people who are understanding that they have privilege whether they\u2019ve asked for it or not.\u201d</p> <p>It is the fight of a generation, she says, but the vastness of it does not put her off identifying the practical solutions she wants now: the resignation of the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, for one. \u201cI work with the police and they want the racist police officers out of the force the same way I do. But if you\u2019ve got the head of the force refusing to acknowledge anything\u2019s wrong, that\u2019s never going to happen. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/19/met-police-disproportionately-white-for-another-100-years\">She doesn\u2019t accept the terminology \u2018institutional racism\u2019</a>. If she doesn\u2019t accept it, how can she be committed to eradicate it from her police force?\u201d</p> <p>Butler is also calling for an end to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/stop-and-search\">stop and search</a>. \u201cIt does not work \u2013 or rather, it works the way it\u2019s designed to work \u2013 it is designed to be discriminatory. The fact is, where a police officer can stop a person of colour driving a car, saying: \u2018We smelled drugs coming from your car; that\u2019s why we stopped you,\u2019 and then, when they search the car, there are no drugs, you have to ask yourself: what were they smelling?\u201d</p> <p>Butler is adamant that she wants a life after Westminster \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t want to be wheeled out\u201d \u2013 but she has unfinished business: \u201cthe eradication of racism. We live in a topsy-turvy world where it\u2019s a sin to call someone racist, but not a sin to be racist.\u201d Plus, \u201cI made a commitment to myself, when I was elected to parliament, that I would ensure there would be other African-Caribbean women coming behind me. There\u2019s no point in being the only one. It\u2019s too much of a burden for one person to carry and we won\u2019t see change.\u201d</p>"

Because generally that\u2019s been the case. But that feeling of relief dissolved after big organizations such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1266852547890839552\">the NFL</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheCW/status/1267230279078461443/photo/1\">The CW</a>, as well as stars like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaMichele/status/1266460976116719616\">Lea Michele</a>, jumped on that bandwagon to align themselves with the fight for black humanity. Because these are some of the same platforms that have silenced us.</p> <p>I get it; a major impetus for the protests is the lack of accountability \u2013 for the careless condemnation of black life, the quelling of black voices and the utter disregard for our image. Of course, you want to <em>look</em> like the white organization or public figure that is on the right side of history, appealing to the oppressed who are in part frustrated that a country they helped build has once again abandoned them. And truthfully, black people need the support of non-black people to clench justice in a broken nation still run and dictated by white oppressors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/03/blackout-tuesday-george-floyd-social-media\">As responses to George Floyd's death go, #BlackOutTuesday was embarrassing | Fatima Bhutto</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For one split moment in time, it seemed like some of these influential white entities had finally gotten the point after years of directing their attention toward the absence of accountability, which extends far beyond the court system to the big and small screens as well as our football stadiums.

Not when Michele reportedly made a black former cast mate\u2019s first television gig \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sammie_Ware/status/1267632171570745345\">a living hell</a>\u201d. (Michele has since <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/entertainment/lea-michele-glee-samantha-marie-ware/index.html\">apologized</a>.)</p> <p>Black lives didn\u2019t matter to them then, so their shallow presentations of coalition don\u2019t matter to protesters now. Black people are long past the point of niceties and respectable dialogue that dances around the issues without solving anything at all. There needs to be indisputable action. Hence the question of accountability, or rather the lack thereof, which brought us to this current juncture. In order to gain alliance and make real change, you have to first acknowledge your own actions as wrongdoings.</p> <p>You have to understand the fight you\u2019re allegedly signing up for \u2013 the fight for criminal justice, the fight for black characters to receive the same level of amplification as their white counterparts, the fight to protest against rampant inequality without fear of repercussions or loss of life. You also have to understand your complicity, which includes remaining silent in the face of injustice. Because that only underscores how you willfully and remorselessly benefit from your own privilege.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In order to gain alliance and make real change, you have to first acknowledge your own actions as wrongdoings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s going to take more than just a handsome donation to the NAACP or an empty vow to hire more black storytellers behind the scenes without actually doing so or an equally hollow apology castigating your own actions without a full understanding of why. It needs to be a complete overhaul of your way of thinking and doing today and every other day that follows. One of the most urgent things that these daily protests have made crystal clear is that what was once passable can no longer be tolerated. Accountability is not merely a suggestion but a mandate that has similarly merciless impact if not adhered.</p> <p>That means you will continue to be publicly called out about any false commitments to do better. Apathy toward any lingering black supporters, one of the largest consumer groups on the planet, may result in depleted ratings or ticket sales. Voting in favor of white supremacy and against the lives of black people you swiftly hailed during this one moment in time will surely be met with more sleepless nights of protest in the street.</p> <p>Black people simply have no time to hold your hand or explain how you have wronged us and should no longer be expected to do so. Racism is something we live with every single day of our lives. You\u2019re either in this fight with us every day, or you\u2019re not. If it is the latter, consider these protests your official notice.</p> <p>There is no going back to the way things were handled. This has to be our new normal.</p> <ul> <li><p>On Tuesday 9 June at&nbsp;7pm BST (2pm EDT) the Guardian is&nbsp;holding a live-streamed event&nbsp;about the meaning of George Floyd\u2019s killing,&nbsp;featuring&nbsp;Guardian&nbsp;journalists including&nbsp;US southern bureau chief&nbsp;Oliver Laughland, reporter&nbsp;Kenya Evelyn, writer&nbsp;Chris McGreal and columnist&nbsp;Malaika Jabali.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/guardian-newsroom-the-killing-of-george-floyd-107707269342\">Book tickets here</a></p></li> </ul>"

It\u2019s different both in terms of numbers and in terms of the breadth of the bills.\u201d</p> <p>In 2017, amid a swell of anti-Trump activism, more than 30 anti-protest bills were introduced, prompting the UN\u2019s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/08/donald-trump-anti-protest-bills\">to complain to the US state department</a>, while legislation was also introduced <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-bills-protest-criminal-20170201-story.html\">in response to demonstrations</a> against the Dakota access pipeline.</p> <p>In 2021, it\u2019s the widespread Black Lives Matter protests of previous summer that seem to have prompted the anti-protest backlash.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing but not terribly surprising, because we had a really powerful and expressive summer of protest,\u201d Eidelman said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd as we have seen consistently in the last five or so years, legislators have chosen to respond to protests spilling out, people expressing themselves, by trying to silence those people, rather than trying to engage with their messages.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the bills working their way through state legislatures share common provisions, whether creating vague and ill-defined new crimes, or increasing penalties on already illegal conduct.</p> <p>Not all of the bills will be passed into law, \u201cbut even the fact that they\u2019re introduced is a serious problem\u201d, Eidelman said.</p> <p>\u201cNot only do these bills seek to impose monetary and criminal penalties, but there are also provisions in a number of states that would bar people from public employment, public benefits, and public office,\u201d Eidelman said.</p> <p>\u201cWhich I think is really dangerous and troubling, especially during Covid when people are really requiring things like public benefits.\u201d</p> <p>Barring demonstrators convicted under draconian protest laws would prevent people like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/18/john-lewis-obituary\">John Lewis</a>, the late Georgia congressman and civil rights activist, from holding public office, and potentially prevent people who become engaged in politics through protest from seeking election.</p> <p>Since the death of George Floyd on 25 May 2020, <a href=\"https://www.icnl.org/usprotestlawtracker/?location=&amp;status=&amp;issue=&amp;date=custom&amp;date_from=2020-06-01&amp;date_to=2021-04-01&amp;type=\">95 bills</a> that would restrict the right to peacefully assemble and protest have been introduced across the country, said Elly Page, a senior legal adviser at the <a href=\"https://www.icnl.org/\">International Center for not-for-profit law</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an extremely concerning attack on a core constitutional right \u2013 one that is fundamental to democratic participation and that has been critical to social progress throughout our country\u2019s history,\u201d Page said in an email.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bb10be92b3b28f2b606c7c5d31752fc761060026\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb10be92b3b28f2b606c7c5d31752fc761060026/0_0_3900_2600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters march in downtown Miami in June 2020 during a protest over the death of George Floyd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters march in downtown Miami in June 2020 during a protest over the death of George Floyd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe legislation itself makes clear who is targeted, too.

Four officers<a href=\"https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/mayhem-4-police-officers-shot-during-long-night-of-violence-and-destruction-in-st-louis/article_87ac7e92-e6bf-59d9-8488-10c7fe462063.html\"> were shot</a> in St Louis, Missouri, and one officer in Las Vegas was on life support after being shot in the head. A police officer in New York City was in serious condition after being hit by a car.</p> <p>Police were largely absent for crucial minutes in New York City as looters moved along Fifth Avenue, the central axis of Manhattan island, and through the Midtown shopping district. Crowds broke into Macy\u2019s flagship department store and dozens of other businesses. A curfew was in place from 11pm on Monday to 5am Tuesday, and more than 700 people were arrested.</p> <p>Mayor Bill de Blasio rejected criticism that the police force had failed to ensure public safety. \u201cThere were peaceful protesters who rejected the violent elements and forced them out of protests,\u201d De Blasio said. \u201cThat ultimately is the big story here.\u201d</p> <p>The lack of a police presence echoed scenes from a night earlier in Chicago, where dozens of officers were deployed to surveil peaceful protests as vandalism played out in another part of the city.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do we need over 100 police to enforce a peaceful protest in Old Town when mayhem and lawlessness runs rampant in Bronzeville and Washington Park?\u201d alderman Pat Dowell wrote on Facebook in remarks picked up by <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-chicago-unrest-policing-20200602-bdjvkhctsbfa3n2sfr5tqdgxje-story.html\">the Chicago Tribune</a>.</p> <p>In Louisville, Kentucky, a police chief was fired after officers killed an African American restaurant owner, David McAtee. The officers involved in the incident had not activated their body cameras as required by department policy.</p> <p>In Atlanta, Georgia, two police officers were fired on Sunday and three others were placed on desk duty after officers used Tasers on two college students who had been sitting in a car. The action violated department restrictions against excessive use of force.</p> <p>\u201cAfter review of that footage, Chief [Erika] Shields and I have made the determination that two of the officers involved in the incident last night will be terminated immediately,\u201d Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said at a news conference.</p> <p>A county prosecutor announced on Tuesday that arrest warrants had been issued for six Atlanta officers on charges including aggravated assault, simple battery, criminal damage to property, pointing a handgun and aggravated battery.</p> <p>Police shot dead a member of a crowd in Las Vegas who had&nbsp;\u201cmultiple firearms who appeared to be wearing body armor\u201d, the local police department said in a statement.</p> <p>The prime minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, asked the Australian embassy to investigate the assault by security forces on a reporter and cameraman in Washington DC. &nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cYou heard us yelling there that we were media but they don\u2019t care, they are being indiscriminate at the moment,\u201d the Australian reporter <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/calls-for-media-freedom-during-george-floyd-protests-as-australian-news-crew-assaulted-on-air\">said</a> on air after the assault. The incident followed days of direct attacks on and arrests of members of the press from <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2020/05/31/register-reporter-arrested-while-covering-protest/5304560002/\">Des Moines</a> to <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/y3zd7g/i-told-riot-cops-im-a-journalist-they-forced-me-to-the-ground-and-pepper-sprayed-me-in-the-face\">Minneapolis</a>.</p> <p>Elsewhere, in cities including Denver, Omaha, Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, police officers and peaceful protesters made <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/02/us/police-protesters-together/index.html\">demonstrations of unity</a>, with some officers kneeling or joining marches and marchers embracing uniformed officers.</p> <p>Perhaps the most prominent incident on Monday evening of an unprovoked attack on peaceful protesters was not carried out by local police but at the direction of Donald Trump.</p> <p>The mayor of Washington DC said the troops who unleashed teargas on protesters outside the White House so the president could stage a photo-op at nearby St John\u2019s church were military police, not members of the local department.</p> <p>A second unusual show of force, in which a US army Blackhawk helicopter hovered low over protest crowds, was not related to local police activity.</p>"

Did you think that chaos was a ladder that you could climb?\u201d</p> <p>Bolton answered that he \u201ccertainly heard all the stories\u201d but spoke with Trump before he took office and \u201centered aware of the problems but optimistic that they could be overcome\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/23/trevor-noah-trump-tulsa-rally-daily-show-recap\">Trevor Noah on Trump's Tulsa rally: 'Foiled by a bunch of meddling kids'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked by Colbert about what long-time Republicans in government are saying behind closed doors, Bolton said that \u201cin fairness to Trump,\u201d many conservatives see the comparison with Joe Biden, \u201cas I did in 2016 with Hillary Clinton,\u201d and say, \u201cwhatever we think of him, he\u2019s not going to be a Democrat subject, especially these days, to the pressure of the left.\u201d</p> <p>Colbert laughed at the \u201cpressure from the left\u201d idea and interjected: \u201cNo, he\u2019s going to be subject to the pressure of Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping!</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a person who\u2019s going to sell out the interests of the American people for his own re-election. What could be worse in Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden\u2019s philosophy than betraying your own country to a hostile foreign leader, sir?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrust me, I understand that point,\u201d Bolton stuttered before Colbert shot back: \u201cBut will you answer that question?\u201d</p> <p>Bolton explained that his view of Trump in 2016 was \u201cwe at least have to try it out\u201d \u2013 which is why he voted for him.</p> <p>But \u201chaving experienced 17 months of working with him, I can\u2019t in good conscience do that again.\u201d Bolton again confirmed, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/21/politics/john-bolton-joe-biden-2020-trump/index.html\">as he has previously</a>, that he would not vote for either Trump or Biden in November.</p> <p>\u201cI guess what\u2019s exasperating is there is absolutely nothing that Donald Trump has done that is surprising to me,\u201d Colbert responded. \u201cMy rule is, everything you think about Donald Trump is probably true. Because he\u2019s not deep enough to get your socks wet in. He\u2019s incredibly readable,\u201d which is why when he ran casinos, \u201cthe house <em>lost\u201d \u2013</em> a comment which drew a laugh from Bolton.</p> <p>But Bolton\u2019s smile darkened as Colbert continued: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to learn about him. He\u2019s essentially a boring person. How did you not know beforehand that he was just callow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t believe it was that bad,\u201d Bolton replied. \u201cAnd I know other people say they saw it from the beginning \u2013 \u201d</p> <p>Colbert cut him off, laughing again, and asked: \u201cBut you\u2019re an international negotiator, how could you be naive? You\u2019ve dealt with the worst people in the world.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve really insulted me now by calling me naive,\u201d Bolton replied.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was possible to work with somebody,\u201d he said of Trump, because \u201csurely they would want to learn about the complexities of arms control negotiations and that sort of thing. As I detail in the book, that turned out not to be true.\u201d</p> <h2>Trevor Noah</h2> <p>And on The Daily Show, Trevor Noah investigated systemic under-representation of black people in corporate America despite a flurry of Black Lives Matter solidarity tweets and posts from companies who clearly have some internal work to do. Nike, for example, ran an ad proclaiming, \u201cDon\u2019t pretend there\u2019s not a problem in America,\u201d though all of the company\u2019s executives are white.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1275624466886860800\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">From code-switching to daily microaggressions, here\u2019s a slice of what Black people go through in corporate America: <a href=\"https://t.co/rhOFa7kvrt\">pic.twitter.com/rhOFa7kvrt</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1275624466886860800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 24, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cIf you are just some random person who has like ten followers on Twitter and you tweet Black Lives Matter, maybe that\u2019s the best you can do,\u201d said Noah. \u201cBut if you\u2019re a major corporation that hires thousands of people, you can actually show that black lives matter in a material way that goes beyond your social media feed.\u201d</p> <p>Noah thus investigated actual avenues for corporate accountability for anti-racism in a new segment called \u201c\\This Black American Life.</p> <p>\u201cDespite what your racist uncle says on Facebook, for many black Americans, getting a job is almost impossible,\u201d Noah explained, starting with getting one\u2019s foot in the door; as Pascal Desroches, chief financial officer at WarnerMedia, told CNN, white Americans are hired on potential while black Americans are hired on demonstrated accomplishment.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing I wish more people understood,\u201d said Noah. \u201cBlack people are looking for equality, not charity. They\u2019re not asking people to \u2018hire black people\u2019 just because they\u2019re black, they\u2019re asking companies to stop <em>not</em> hiring black people just because they\u2019re black.\u201d</p> <p>If black employees do get a foot in the door, Noah continued, climbing the ladder is difficult \u2013 only 3.2% of corporate executives in America are black \u2013 and one\u2019s challenges are compounded by micro-aggressions such as \u201cyou\u2019re very articulate,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re not like the others,\u201d and hair-grabbing. Such thoughtlessness is \u201cwhat you get from living in a segregated society,\u201d said Noah.</p> <p>\u201cInstead of knowing black people and black culture, you\u2019ve got white folks interacting with black people like they\u2019re making contact with ET.\u201d</p> <p>Noah ended with a message to corporate America: \u201cIf you really believe in rooting out systemic racism and supporting black lives, then I say to you: examine your own actions within your companies before history leaves you behind. Or as I would put it if I wasn\u2019t in the office: you better check yourself before you wreck yourself.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>California erupted in protest alongside the rest of the country over the weekend, with hundreds of thousands taking to the streets over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.</p> \n<p>Across the state, protesters marched and chanted, calling for justice for not just George Floyd but all victims of police brutality and systemic racism in recent years. The demonstrations sprung up not just in cities known for protest, such as Oakland and Los Angeles, but throughout the state, from Eureka, near the Oregon border, to La Mesa in southern California , from the coastal Santa Cruz to the conservative stronghold of the Central Valley.</p> \n<p>Among the cities where protests emerged:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Los Angeles</p></li> \n <li><p>Oakland</p></li> \n <li><p>San Francisco</p></li> \n <li><p>San Jose</p></li> \n <li><p>Sacramento</p></li> \n <li><p>Bakersfield</p></li> \n <li><p>San Diego</p></li> \n <li><p>Fresno</p></li> \n <li><p>Santa Cruz</p></li> \n <li><p>Santa Rosa</p></li> \n <li><p>Eureka</p></li> \n <li><p>Visalia</p></li> \n <li><p>Stockton</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>In many cities, the protesters remembered and honored the lives of their own who were killed or mistreated by police. In Oakland, they marched from a plaza renamed during the Occupy protests for Oscar Grant, the 22-year-old black man who was fatally shot in the back as he laid handcuffed on the ground by a transit police officer in 2009.

Using a tactic that has become common in recent protests, a group of about 30 protesters showed up to Lacey\u2019s Granada Hills home in the early morning. They brought chairs with them saying they were going to hold the community meeting that they had been promised. There were no threats of violence from the demonstrators.</p> \n<p>Abdullah said it seemed the charges were meant to \u201cplacate the community\u201d, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s trying to give us the illusion that there is justice.\u201d</p> \n<p>She also said it had taken time for her to process what happened, though she has continued to be a vocal presence at the demonstrations against police violence in recent months. The incident affected her whole family, she said, noting that her children had to leave their classrooms when it happened: \u201cIt\u2019s not only weighed on me.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hours after the original incident, Jackie Lacey offered a tearful apology to reporters, saying she and her husband were frightened.</p> \n<p>The DA\u2019s office declined to comment on Tuesday and Lacey\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to an inquiry. Lacey is facing a tough re-election fight in November and has long faced criticism for her handling of killings by police, her aggressive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/18/los-angeles-death-penalty-sentences-jackie-lacey\">pursuit of the death penalty</a> and other <a href=\"https://theappeal.org/how-district-attorney-jackie-lacey-failed-los-angeles/\">tough-on-crime strategies</a>.</p>"

It's defunding. Here's why  | Alex S Vitale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is no shortage of examples of police using excessive force against protesters. In <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/31/21275994/police-violence-peaceful-protesters-images\">New York</a>, officers who had intentionally covered their badge numbers \u201cpulled down the mask of a peaceful protester, who had his hands up, and pepper-sprayed him in the face\u201d. In Salt Lake City, an older man with a cane was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/1266908354821206016\">shoved to the ground</a>. In Austin, police shot a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayjanner/status/1267111893753307137\">pregnant woman</a> in the stomach with a \u201cnon-lethal\u201d round. There were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drivenbyboredom/status/1267263490009546753\">scenes</a> reminiscent of the infamously brutal suppression of demonstrators at the 1968 Chicago Democratic convention. As Reason<em> </em><a href=\"https://reason.com/2020/05/31/d-c-cops-kept-herding-protesters-into-harms-way/\">concluded</a>, officers around the country acted with \u201ctotal disregard for protesters\u2019 safety or rights\u201d.</p> <p>There was no real need for those New York officers to disguise their badge numbers. After all, even when police officers\u2019 names are fully known, there is rarely any accountability. The whole reason protesters are angry is that it seems American cops can get away with almost anything. In 2016, an Arizona police officer <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/09/us/police-shooting-video-arizona.html\">executed a man</a> who was pleading for his life. It was on video. The officer was <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/daniel-shaver-shooting-ex-arizona-police-officer-not-guilty-murder-n827641\">acquitted</a>. This was not an exceptional case; it <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/police-officers-convicted-fatal-shootings-are-exception-not-rule-n982741\">happens over and over</a>. If outright murder goes unpunished, no officer need every worry about getting in trouble for blinding and maiming a few protesters.&nbsp;</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s the protesters who are called violent, even when the overwhelming majority do nothing but march and chant \u2013&nbsp;though they <em>do </em>refuse to back down, and challenging authority can be a capital crime in a police state. There have certainly been plenty of instances of vandalism and theft accompanying demonstrations, but it\u2019s important to make a clear distinction between acts of property destruction and actual violence. Setting a police car on fire is very costly to taxpayers, but harm to human bodies should be far more disturbing.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Setting a police car on fire is very costly to taxpayers, but harm to human bodies should be far more disturbing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>American police have been brutal for a long time, and both Democratic and Republican presidents have failed to successfully reform them. Barack Obama\u2019s justice department was admirable for <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-baltimore-chicago-police-2016-story.html\">at least investigating</a> a number of egregiously out-of-control departments, though <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/08/wait-do-people-actually-know-just-how-evil-this-man-is/\">outright criminals like Joe Arpaio</a> managed to remain in power throughout Obama\u2019s term. Donald Trump made it clear from the outset that if it was up to him, police could brutalize people with total impunity \u2013&nbsp;he even explicitly encouraged cops to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/28/16059536/trump-cops-speech-gang-violence-long-island\">rough people up during arrests</a>. <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/05/trumps-george-floyd-obama-protest-police-violence-kneeling.html\">According to</a> the Trump-supporting head of the Minneapolis police union, the president has reversed Obama\u2019s policies by \u201cletting the cops do their job, put the handcuffs on the criminals instead of us\u201d. But when cops kill, as in the case of George Floyd, they need to be the ones with the handcuffs on. Otherwise they have a license to freely murder citizens.&nbsp;</p> <p>There have been commendable exceptions to the pattern of police misconduct. In Michigan, a local sheriff <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/31/us/flint-michigan-protest-police-trnd/index.html\">marched with protesters</a> and in New York, several officers shocked protesters by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/31/us/nypd-officers-kneel-with-protesters-trnd/index.html\">joining them in taking a knee</a>. But it seems to be that there are just a few \u201cgood apples\u201d in a generally rotten bunch. The frequency of aggressive, militarized responses to civil demonstrations suggests there is something very deeply wrong with police culture and with policing as an institution.</p> <p>At the very least, we need to seriously demilitarize the police, so that they do not appear to be an occupying army, <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2017/10/21/when-local-cops-drive-tanks-the-deadly-consequences-of-militarizing-mayberry/\">complete with tanks</a>. But there are serious criminal punishment scholars <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/15/alex-vitale-interview-the-end-of-policing/\">who have suggested</a> we need to talk about \u201cending the police\u201d altogether. By this, they do not mean allowing anyone to victimize anyone else without fear of consequences, or ceasing to protect the population from threats. Rather, they mean totally rethinking how laws are enforced and how social problems are addressed. Having a militarized force respond to situations that require social workers trained to deal with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Charles_Kinsey\">mental health issues</a> has often made things <a href=\"https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/family-of-man-killed-by-cpd-says-he-was-mentally-ill-should-not-have-been-shot\">tragically worse rather than better</a>. Frankly, fire departments seem like they would do a much better job addressing many of the situations that police are now dispatched to deal with. Firefighters actually protect and serve, while police too often act like squads of armed thugs rather than compassionate and helpful community servants.&nbsp;</p> <p>In theory, the police are supposed to protect the community. When they are whacking the community with sticks, and firing teargas into it, they are more like an armed gang than keepers of the peace. When police show no interest in obeying the constitution or treating protesters with dignity and care, then they should cease to command respect. A police force that runs amok does not deserve to be called \u201claw enforcement\u201d. They are rioters, plain and simple.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Nathan Robinson is a Guardian US columnist and the editor of Current Affairs</p></li> </ul>"

When actor John Boyega, from Star Wars and Attack the Block, addressed protesters at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/thousands-gather-in-london-for-george-floyd-protest\">Black Lives Matter rally in London\u2019s Hyde Park</a>, he said: \u201cI\u2019m speaking to you from my heart. Look, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to have a career after this, but fuck that.\u201d Social media exploded with knowing jeers and giggling gotchas about how, actually, Boyega <em>had</em> to protest, or else his career would suffer! People on Twitter who had shown no very obvious knowledge of or interest in the issue of civil rights or Hollywood politics before this, were suddenly intoxicated by their delicious paradox, and made Boyega\u2019s comments the pretext of once again righteously smashing the 5G mast of liberal power.</p> \n<p>I don\u2019t think Boyega\u2019s comments will have any effect on his career, either good or bad. The career of this excellent actor was in great shape before this and it will continue to be in great shape. But vehement protests of this high-profile kind are not quite as commonplace as you might assume. Although protests about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> have been replicated in cities around the world, there is no evidence of compulsory virtue-signalling from actors. In the US, there have been protests from Jamie Foxx and Michael B Jordan and many others, but it\u2019s naive to imagine agents in LA calling their clients and ordering them to join in. For every celebrity or public figure who speaks out, many more keep their heads down.</p> \n<p>John Boyega\u2019s words strike me as a gallant, passionate, heartfelt gesture of solidarity \u2013 which will have real&nbsp;impact. As a black British actor who has been given a platform by Hollywood, and who has spoken himself about his own sense of kinship between black British and African American communities, Boyega has used his public profile as a force for idealism and consciousness-raising. (Which the world of mainstream-punditry once praised when Princess Diana did it for landmine-clearance and Aids patients.) One note of support has come from the Star Wars brand itself: his decision to speak out sealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/04/john-boyega-anti-racism-speech-wins-praise-star-wars-costars-black-lives-matter\">its corporate decision to associate itself</a> with the protest.</p> \n<p>His dramatic speech is part of a vigorous and distinguished tradition: Harry Belafonte performed at a benefit for Martin Luther King in 1966, and at many other occasions and civil rights demonstrations, and the white British singer Petula Clark infuriated racists by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/02/how-petula-clark-and-harry-belafonte-fought-racism-arm-in-arm\">appearing on the same stage as him</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f76c136a38e69a306e4435efeff3889c57bc4d04\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f76c136a38e69a306e4435efeff3889c57bc4d04/0_362_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Belafonte and Petula Clark in 1968.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry Belafonte and Petula Clark in 1968.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Vietnam galvanised Hollywood protesters including Jane Fonda, John Lennon and Yoko Ono. In recent years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/02/george-clooney-racism-americas-pandemic-george-floyd-killing-minneapolis\">George Clooney</a> and his father, journalist Nick Clooney, were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/16/george-clooney-arrested-sudanese-embassy\">arrested in 2012 outside the Sudanese embassy</a> in protest at the lack of humanitarian aid and the killing of Sudanese civilians. Danny Glover was arrested in 2010 outside a food service corporation in Maryland as part of a solidarity protest in support of the labour union there. There are many such events, and Sean Penn, Susan Sarandon and Martin Sheen have become protest veterans. Of course, these events have become understood as a species of media event: the&nbsp;<em>bien-pensant&nbsp;</em>star marches with a placard \u2013 many are irritated by what they see as an affectation; some more notice only the star\u2019s appearance and do not remember what the cause was, but some will, like iron filings sticking to a magnet that\u2019s been shaken.</p> \n<p>It brings us back to John Boyega. His Hyde Park speech is a teachable moment in the history of race, racism and celebrity. It has become a truism to note how Hollywood now gives black British actors who can do American accents real career chances that might well not be available back in Blighty. Perhaps in the UK they would be stuck playing minor roles or bad guys or hopeless social-realist cases; in Hollywood they can get to be heroes, who take on the Evil Empire. That may well resonate with black British audiences and black Britons who wonder why the history of empire does not have the urgency of Tudors and Nazis in British schools or historical TV programmes, and they are impatient with people in this country who behave as if racism in Britain is a minor bad-apple affair compared to that in America. John Boyega has spoken out on racial injustice in his own person on his own terms and challenged all of this.</p>"

Assault category breakdown: 69 physical attacks (43 by cops), 43 tear gassings, 24 pepper sprayings, 77 rubber bullets/projectiles.\u201d</p> <p>Many campaigners find the situation impossible to divorce from Trump\u2019s sustained contempt for the media. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/trumps-attacks-on-the-news-media-are-accelerating-you-can-expect-three-results/2019/09/03/fedfff66-ce3d-11e9-87fa-8501a456c003_story.html\">He has</a> railed against \u201cfake news\u201d and described the press as \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://pen.org/user/suzanne-nossel/\">Suzanne Nossel,</a> chief executive of PEN America, a leading human rights and free expression organisation, said: \u201cYou can\u2019t but see the linkage when somebody with such a powerful platform has been relentlessly attacking individual journalists and media outlets and discrediting their reporting so persistently, and then you see members of law enforcement who are actually willing to be caught on film and on camera arresting and attacking members of the media who are doing their job.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/05/im-getting-shot-attacks-on-journalists-surge-in-us-protests\">'I\u2019m getting shot': attacks on journalists surge in US protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She added: \u201cIt\u2019s as if a switch had been turned off in terms of respecting the role of a free press in a democracy.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/f5f5eb3e38d3dd2f6fd0bf1b376b94cf\">Attacks on journalists by</a> protesters, or people who attach themselves to protests, has also been another striking feature of the demonstrations, which have generally been peaceful by day but in some instances marred by violence at night. A crew from Fox News was surrounded by demonstrators outside the White House and jeered at and pelted with objects until they fled. In Atlanta, a crowd stormed the headquarters of CNN.</p> <p>Nossel added: \u201cYour goal in terms of mounting a forceful demonstration is to capture attention and headlines and television coverage and the media is crucial to that, so for protesters to turn on journalists evinces a real confusion about what it is that keeps our democracy and mechanisms of accountability working.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"63fbcb2296ea457f08e945305b3375d42e518d30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63fbcb2296ea457f08e945305b3375d42e518d30/2837_0_3990_4990/800.jpg\" alt=\"Linda Tirado in 2014.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Linda Tirado in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe press makes mistakes and misjudgments and that\u2019s a fact, but to think of a working journalist as somehow your enemy, somebody deserving of attack, does reflect this campaign of denigration and discrediting.\u201d</p> <p>But law enforcement has been by far the main culprit.</p> <p>In Minneapolis alone, Linda Tirado, a freelance photojournalist and activist who has contributed to the Guardian, said she was now blind in her left eye after being shot at by police; the CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez, who is black, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/black-cnn-reporter-arrested-on-air-minneapolis-protests-george-floyd-killing\">was arrested on live television</a> and released a short time later; Ali Velshi, a host on the MSNBC network, said he was shot in the leg by police firing rubber bullets after his crew identified themselves as journalists.</p> <p>In Washington, Amelia Brace and Tim Myers were reporting for Australia\u2019s 7News channel outside the White House when they, along with peaceful protesters, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/trump-george-floyd-protests-military-deploy\">were charged by park police</a> and the national guard so Trump could stage a photo op outside a historic church. </p> <p>With its first amendment guarantee of free speech, America has typically been relied on by journalists, writers and dissidents around the world who face persecution from authoritarian governments. Washington has condemned media repression in Egypt, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/29/stop-the-press-turkey-crackdown-journalists-overdrive-since-coup\">Turkey</a> and elsewhere. But that moral credibility has been put at risk by a steady deterioration during the Trump era.</p> <p>In 2018, the US for the first time joined the ranks of the most dangerous countries for journalists to operate, according to the advocacy group Reporters Without Borders. Last week the International Crisis Group, usually preoccupied by global hotspots, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/george-floyd-killing-black-community-injustice-analysis\">warned that racial division</a> risks further \u201cdivision and instability\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking from Zimbabwe, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BitiTendai?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Tendai Biti,</a> a human rights lawyer, said he has a 13-year-old son growing up in Maryland. \u201cI\u2019m thinking whether I made the right decision to allow him to go to school in the United States of America because he\u2019s black and it\u2019s obvious there are huge structural issues around race, around inequality, around exclusion which America must deal with,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfa9df5ea56d48e54a541c190e3ce73ce79224cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfa9df5ea56d48e54a541c190e3ce73ce79224cf/0_107_5765_3461/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Colorado.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Colorado.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBut what\u2019s also shocking is the disproportionate response of the state, if you like, the Africanisation of American politics, the language of exclusion and the language of hate and, of course, what we\u2019ve seen, the exuberant and excessive force used by the authorities.\u201d</p> <p>Biti, a former political prisoner who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/06/zimbabwe-tendai-biti-assassination-fears\">served as finance minister</a> in a power-sharing agreement with the then president, Robert Mugabe, added: \u201cFor us, who have been fighting autocracies and dictatorship on the African continent, the events in America are giving licence and legitimacy to the authoritarianism and dictatorship and violence that we have seen as democrats for decades.</p> <p>\u201cEvery little tinpot on the African continent is smiling and is studying America\u2019s new copybook plucked from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, from Zimbabwe, from the Central African Republic, from Djibouti.\u201d</p> <p>The implications for journalists in Africa and elsewhere are profound, Biti added. \u201cWhenever truth becomes a casualty then journalists will suffer. They are mediums of communication, whether it\u2019s newspapers, whether it\u2019s websites, whether it\u2019s social media. In Africa, once, the medium of communication becomes a target, then the messengers become targets and you\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d</p> <p>Far from toning down his rhetoric, Trump has continued his assault in remarks and tweets. At the end of May <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1267132763116838913?s=20\">he wrote</a>, \u201cThe Lamestream Media is doing everything within their power to foment hatred and anarchy,\u201d and called journalists \u201ctruly bad people with a sick agenda\u201d. He has not offered any hint that he accepts responsibility for helping create a hostile environment.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/experts/william-a-galston/\">Bill Galston,</a> a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, said: \u201cI do a lot of reading every day about how the rest of the world is reacting to this and, as an American, it makes me really want to cry. We are the object of scorn from our enemies and pity from our friends. We\u2019ve come to this? At least your country [the UK] has had some decades to get accustomed to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-george-floyd-america-social-collapse-b566ae78-907c-41b7-992d-be5e33521fb2.html\">the idea of national decline</a>.

Since her son Amadou Diallo\u2019s death in a hail of 41 bullets from police in 1999, Kadiatou Diallo has watched black mothers grieve. So has Valerie Bell, since police shot her son Sean Bell 50 times hours before his wedding in 2006. As has Constance Malcolm, after police followed her 17-year-old son, Ramarley Graham, into his home in 2012, shooting him in front of his six-year-old brother after alleging they saw a gun on the unarmed teen.</p> <p>The four women spoke to a reporter ahead of a march in New York last week, organized by the families who have lost loved ones to police killings, as part of the ongoing protest movement triggered by Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no change,\u201d Diallo said.

All three mothers still hesitate to proclaim a changed nation as the country is gripped by weeks of protests. It\u2019s too soon, they say.&nbsp;</p> <p>All of the women agree that their call for changes to police protocols is one they have demanded for years. What\u2019s different this time, Malcolm says, is a generation hungry for change.</p> <p>\u201cWe have young people that want change. And they\u2019re on the frontline [and] they\u2019re willing to, basically, to me \u2026 they were willing to die, because if you see them up in these cops\u2019 faces, they have guns. And we know what they do when they have guns,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time that we\u2019ve been struggling as a people,\u201d Bell agreed.</p> <p>As a group, these women have called for a <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/gwenn-carr-constance-malcolm-cuomo-unkept-promise-article-1.2283047\">special prosecutor </a>to investigate all officer-involved deaths since 2015, the repeal of a <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-pol-50a-police-discipline-diallo-bell-garner-carr-20181223-story.html\">New York state law</a> protecting police from the release of their disciplinary records, and defunding the police.</p> <p>\u201cOur surviving children and grandchildren deserve to have a better future,\u201d said Diallo. \u201cThe only change I noticed,\u201d she added a little later, \u201cis the camera. The videos, that is educating people, showing them the truth.\u201d</p> <p>The video documenting Floyd\u2019s death has now been watched millions of times around the world, renewing calls for change, spurring protests and calls for changes to police departments nationally.&nbsp;Millions saw Garner\u2019s death, too, along with his final words: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p> <p>The officer involved in Garner\u2019s death was not indicted by a Staten Island grand jury.

Bell spent the previous weekend calling her local officials well into midnight along with Malcolm.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cYou have to keep on, and so many of them are out there who have it in their mind that they want to make the change, but they\u2019re afraid to make that change,\u201d Bell said. Some police forces have addressed those calls, taking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/09/new-york-police-budget-cut\">moderate steps</a> to reform policies.</p> <p>The four women are a tight-knit group.</p> <p>We are a team, Diallo said. One that won\u2019t stop.</p> <p>\u201cWhen George Floyd called his mama, all of the mothers were summoned to push forward and make things happen. Our strength, our strength is to really push forward the change we need because we\u2019re not going to give up.

     "standfirst": "<p>The Rugby Against Racism campaign was belatedly born this week, 25 years after the game turned professional and thanks in the main to the raised awareness brought by the Black Lives Matter movement</p>",
     "body": "<p>Black lives matter. Those three words \u2013 a statement distilled to its purest form \u2013 are the best explanation I can give as to why I will take a knee when rugby restarts on Friday night. I am totally aware that the statement has been politicised and I strongly disagree with some of the things the organisation stands for, but there is one reason why pretty much every household has developed a greater understanding and awareness of anti-racism recently: the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>I also want to clear something up when it comes to taking a knee. There is the obvious association with the political organisation \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/12/premiership-rugby-union-will-restart-with-three-teams-taking-a-knee\">which has seen some Premiership players reluctant to do it this weekend</a> \u2013 and there is the fact that it was popularised by Colin Kaepernick, who has become such a global figure. But as I understand it, the origin of taking a knee was when Martin Luther King did so in 1965 during the civil rights movement. He did so as a peaceful protest and as a moment to say a prayer. I want to acknowledge and honour people like that who have done so much for people like me.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/12/premiership-rugby-union-restart-club-by-club-guide-comings-and-goings-2019-20\">Premiership restart: club-by-club guide to rugby union's return | Michael Aylwin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I also want to point out that I don\u2019t expect everyone to know that, because racism is not relatable to a lot of people. That is the fundamental point here \u2013 we are trying to make it relatable, to increase awareness and understanding. That\u2019s why I will take a knee, not for any other reason, and that\u2019s why I stand by Black Lives Matter because when you take it in its purest form, the origins of it are what I believe in. Nothing else. After all that\u2019s what the original meaning was before it was hijacked.</p> <p>My view is pretty clear, but at the same time I can\u2019t think of anything more counterintuitive than coercing rugby players to take a knee before their matches if they are not happy doing so. The people who are speaking up are from a community, or several communities, who felt marginalised. We can\u2019t then go and marginalise people for not taking a knee under the banner of anti-racism. It would be ridiculous.</p> <p>And it\u2019s not for me to make a judgment on people. We live in a democracy and people must use that liberty and that freedom. The one thing that is really required is a level of respect. If we respect and understand that people are different, all different shapes, sizes, backgrounds \u2013 you are inevitably going to get people who think differently. We have to respect all viewpoints, so long as it\u2019s not inciting hate or discriminatory in any way.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We need to stop having a debate about whether there is a problem or not \u2013 because speak to any black player and they will tell you there is</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m trying to create awareness and understanding but me talking about racism doesn\u2019t solve racism. I\u2019m trying to start a conversation in the hope it leads to action. I was having these conversations 10 weeks ago, trying to be proactive, and perhaps rugby has been a little bit slow to acknowledge the significance of it. Perhaps the fact that we are restarting as one of the last sports doesn\u2019t help, but I felt it was important that we have our \u201cday one\u201d before getting on with the season.</p> <p>This weekend has to be day one of rugby\u2019s fight against racism. Premiership Rugby is a very different type of organisation to the Premier League but right throughout this process rugby has been casting its eye and taking the lead from football. Well, look at football\u2019s long-standing anti-racism campaign. Rugby didn\u2019t have one until this week with Rugby Against Racism but it has been professional for 25 years. Don\u2019t tell me that there has not been any racial problems in that time, don\u2019t tell me there has not been injustice \u2013 this goes way back even before the professional era.</p> <p>There are some uncomfortable truths about our game but it\u2019s hard to progress until people recognise there is a problem. Until you do that you can\u2019t fix it. We need to stop having a debate about whether there is a problem or not \u2013 because speak to any black player and they will tell you there is. Anything beyond that is wilful ignorance and we have to be comfortable accepting that and then we can work towards dealing with it.</p> <p>I have been heavily involved as part of the working group, along with the former sevens international James Bailey and player representatives from each of the clubs. A consistent theme over the past few months has been a tendency for the public debate to revolve around what I would call the symptoms when we should be talking about the illness.</p> <p>Take Covid as an example, two main symptoms are a high temperature and a persistent cough. If I went to the chemist and got some medicine it might help but it\u2019s ignoring the illness. You have to address the illness. Swing Low, Sweet Chariot is a symptom \u2013 I don\u2019t really care about that, I\u2019m not bothered \u2013 can we now talk about the illness, about racism?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.<br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>For me it\u2019s not just about this weekend, it\u2019s about what we do next week and the week after to try and bring about change. It\u2019s what you do consistently. This isn\u2019t just about a moment in time, it\u2019s about our game being better and actively doing the things that it says it wants to do. It says it welcomes everyone \u2013 it may welcome everyone but it has not always made everyone feel comfortable.</p> <p>I love rugby, but I\u2019m really passionate about this because I think it could be better. I\u2019ve had my challenges in rugby \u2013 there is not a single player who hasn\u2019t \u2013 but some that I have faced I shouldn\u2019t have had to. It\u2019s about trying to combat that. I was talking to a referee about it recently. Teams will prepare for when they go down to 14 men \u2013 not because they want to or expect to but if you don\u2019t think about these things you\u2019ll never know how to properly deal with them. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do with anti-racism.</p>"

Starmer said he felt compelled to sack her because \u201cI do not consider sharing that article furthered the course of rebuilding trust with the Jewish community\u201d.</p> <p>The Independent originally contextualised Peake\u2019s comments with a denial from an Israeli police spokesperson that they would recommend kneeling on a suspect\u2019s neck, before referencing a <a href=\"https://www.amnestyusa.org/with-whom-are-many-u-s-police-departments-training-with-a-chronic-human-rights-violator-israel/\">2016 blog post by Amnesty International USA</a> on how US police forces are regularly trained by Israeli officials.</p> <p>Several hours later the interview was updated to include a stronger denial from an Israeli police spokesperson insisting \u201cthere is no tactic or protocol that calls to put pressure on the neck or airway\u201d. An editor\u2019s note was also attached, distancing the Independent from Peake\u2019s claim: \u201cThis article has been amended to further clarify that the allegation that US police were taught tactics of \u2018neck kneeling\u2019 by Israeli secret services is unfounded.\u201d</p> <p>The connections between US police forces and the training offered by the Israeli state has come under increased media attention in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis. This has generated viral posts and media coverage that has sometimes extrapolated from known facts to make broader unsourced claims. </p> <p>There is no doubt that there are many programmes involving Israeli officials offering training to US police forces. Some programmes are conducted on US soil in conjunction with the Israeli embassy, <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2012/06/25/minn-police-learn-from-israeli-counter-terrorism-conference\">such as a 2012 event</a> where 100 officers from Minnetonka \u2013 a city 8 miles from Minneapolis, where Floyd was killed \u2013 were trained on how to combat terrorists. Other programmes, often organised by pro-Israel organisations based in the US, involved flying small groups of officers to Israel for training programmes. Such police exchanges are not uncommon.</p> <p>This recent interest has led to coverage in sites <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-us-police-training-end-knee-neck-protests\">such as Middle East Eye</a> focusing on which US forces have been involved in these exchange programmes, though most have not drawn any link between the Israeli training and the tactic used to kill Floyd.</p>"

Details of arrests are not publicly&nbsp;available, but anecdotally, lawyers said protesters are facing charges for disorderly conduct, obstructing governmental administration and for violating the curfew, which was considered a <a href=\"https://ny.curbed.com/2020/6/2/21278092/new-york-city-curfew-protests-police\">Class B misdemeanour</a>, carrying a maximum sentence of up to three months imprisonment.</p> <p>Despite the coronavirus pandemic, they said most police officers do not wear masks and in some cases confiscate those of protesters who are being \u201cpacked\u201d into cells with no regard for social distancing.</p> <p>Corey Stoughton, head of the special litigation unit at the Legal Aid Society, said:&nbsp;\u201cWe have heard from our clients who have been arrested that the conditions in the holding cells that they are held in, in many cases for 10-20 hours, are abysmal.

Plainclothes cops had been serving a no-knock search warrant in a narcotics investigation when they burst through her door in the first hour of 13 March while Taylor was sleeping. Her boyfriend Kenneth Walker, a licensed gun owner, grabbed his gun and fired off a shot, thinking they were witnessing a home invasion. He hit an officer in the leg.</p> <p>Police fired back more than 20 times, killing Taylor and sending bullets flying into a neighboring apartment. No drugs were found.</p> <p>Yet after her killing, Louisville metro police department described her as a suspect. Her boyfriend was charged with attempted murder of a police officer, and a police union called him an \u201cattempted cop killer\u201d. The cops involved in the incident were not wearing body cameras.</p> <p>Charges against Walker have since been dropped, but the officers still have their freedom and their jobs, driving anger in Louisville. That anger has been compounded by the death of McAtee, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/david-mcatee-louisville-protests-family\">who was shot and killed at his barbecue stand</a> far from the center of protests early Monday morning as LMPD officers and national guard troops tried to clear a crowd violating curfew.</p> <p>Police say McAtee fired a shot, prompting them to open fire. In violation of policy, officers involved were either not wearing body cameras or did not activate them. The killings \u2013 combined with nationwide rage over Floyd\u2019s death and police brutality \u2013 have prompted widespread protests in Louisville over the past nine days.</p> <p>On a sweltering Friday afternoon in downtown Louisville, businesses were busy boarding up windows, but the mood at the park was calm, hopeful and welcoming.

Their long-term goal: to arm and prepare the state of Utah against underground movements they believe<strong> </strong>will incite civil war.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/27/trump-border-patrol-troops-portland-bortac\">'These are his people': inside the elite border patrol unit Trump sent to Portland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The group was conceived in reaction to a Black Lives Matter protest against police brutality organized by different groups in Provo, Utah, on 29 June. That day, a white protester pulled out a gun and shot another white man, who was not protesting but<strong> </strong>driving his vehicle into the protest route. Two shots were fired, and one hit the driver in the arm. Protesters claim the shooting was in self-defence because the driver was hitting marchers; the police found this claim to be unsubstantiated.</p> <p>When Casey Robertson, 47, watched a video of the incident, he felt outraged that this could happen in his \u201clittle town of Provo\u201d. He posted on his Facebook page and a local yard sale page that \u201cprotesters descended on downtown Provo and terrorized citizens and SHOTS WERE FIRED.\u201d He explained that Insurgence, one of the organizing group, was planning another protest for the next night and he rallied \u201cconcerned citizens\u201d to come together, armed and ready to do their part in protecting downtown businesses.</p> <p>This was a call to arms. Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm was born.</p> <p>\u201cI was like, \u2018We need to stand together as citizens and go down there and show these people that we\u2019re not going to allow violence, and that we are not going to allow these anarchist violent groups to tear down Provo,\u201d Robertson told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen without a fight.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm has since organized regular military-style trainings for its members. Robertson says he has been tipped off \u201cby secret sources within the government and law enforcement\u201d that underground organizations like antifa are being funded by Isis, and are using groups like BLM to wreak havoc in the community to destroy American cities and ideals. Even if none of these theories stand up to scrutiny, he is dead set on not letting it happen.</p> <p>Robertson was born and raised in Provo. His dad was a Provo police officer and his mother a police dispatcher. He has voted both sides of the political aisle \u2013 he voted for Clinton and Obama, although he now considers himself a conservative. To him, this is not about politics, but good and evil, and he is ready to die for this cause.</p> <p>\u201cMy biggest fear, probably, is my children being brought up and having to grow up in a country that has completely lost its freedom, and that is under attack, and that is turning into this cesspool of violence and chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cOur enemy is now within, and that\u2019s really scary to me.\u201d</p> <p>This already has a chilling effect on protests: organizers have begun cancelling protests out of fear of Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm coming and escalating the already heated emotions. So far, militia members remain unchallenged, using their second amendment rights to openly bear arms in public throughout the state.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018We are here to protect the community\u2019</strong></h2> <p>That same Black Lives Matter protest that inspired Robertson\u2019s fear was originally planned as a pro-police event in downtown Provo. John Sullivan, 26, the founder of Insurgence USA, a group for racial justice and police reform, organized a counter-protest alongside several other organizers. Protesters were to meet at the Provo police station at 6.30pm that night.</p> <p>Sullivan, one of the few black men organizing<strong> </strong>for racial justice in Utah, is not from Provo but Sandy, a suburb of Salt Lake City. Provo is a hyper-religious Latter-day Saint college town located 45 miles south of Salt Lake City. The city is <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/provocityutah\">made up</a> of about 110,000 people, 88% white, 16.6% Hispanic, and less than 1% black. Local quirks include a strong second amendment culture, strong self-reliant groups, end of world preppers, a booming music scene and a charming Center Street that has at least three ice cream parlors and only recently got its first coffee shop, as the predominant demography does not drink coffee for religious purposes.</p> <p>The Black Lives Matter protesters started to march. They yelled \u201cWhose streets?

He joined in the march. At the intersection of University Avenue and Center Street, he was hit by a silver Excursion going southbound and immediately heard two gunshots, one after the other. DeLong bounced off the car and realized about five other people had also been hit. The driver frantically drove off.</p> <p>Nine minutes later, an ambulance appeared on the scene. The police did not come, and only appeared in full riot gear at 9.40pm when protesters made it back to the front of the police station.</p> <p>Drivers driving into protesters resulting in people shooting guns is becoming more frequent. On July 25, an Austin motorist <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/us/austin-shooting-texas-protests.html\">drove into a crowd</a> and fatally shot a protester. On the same night, another driver drove into protesters in Aurora, Colorado \u2013 except it was a protester who took out his gun and ended up shooting two fellow protesters.</p> <p>After the Provo protest, a policeman told Josianne Petit, 34, a criminal defense paralegal and founder of Mama &amp; Papa Panthers, an organization dedicated to helping parents of all races in raising black children, that the police were inside watching the whole protest on Facebook Live. She said: \u201cI felt fundamentally betrayed. I had worked with Provo PD extensively prior to that protest and I thought I had a good working relationship with them, but to hear the complete disregard they had for the lives of protesters was alarming to me, but also devastating.\u201d</p> <p>Sullivan, the organizer, was not prepared for what transpired, nor did he know that anyone had a gun on his side of the protest. He created another Facebook event to hold a protest two days later in response.</p> <p>On that day, the two sides stood facing each other. The protesters carried posters; the Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm carried assault rifles. The protesters wore black; the paramilitia wore American flags. Both groups wore masks. On the west side, it was to protect themselves from the coronavirus. On the east side, masks were a protection from unwanted media attention.</p> <p>One young man carrying an assault rifle and two magazines of ammunition, with his face completely covered, pointed at the protesters and said: \u201cWhat they have done is straight out of the communist manifesto \u2026 they say that your political beliefs are now your identity and, if somebody\u2019s against your identity, they can justify whatever they do against you because they\u2019re now repressing you for not agreeing with you.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cNot everybody over there but the more extremists will agree with that. Black Lives Matter, as an organization, receives money from people who want to see violence happen.\u201d</p> <p>Another young man walked over and said: \u201cThey hate America. They say they want to change America, that\u2019s un-American.\u201d</p> <p>The BLM protesters were authorized to march in the street. Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm was permitted to march on the sidewalks, guarding the storefronts from the protesters. About 250 policemen were brought in, as well as at least four snipers who stood on the roof of the Nu Skin building, a ten-storey building next to the Mormon temple.</p> <p>One police officer from Springville, a town just south of Provo, said he trusted 99.9% of the men and women with the guns, and said: \u201cThose men and women would be the first people to take a bullet for any of the protesters there.\u201d</p> <p>At the end of the march, Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm members came to the megaphone and repeated the Springville police officer\u2019s line: \u201cWe are here to protect the community. We would be the first to take a bullet for each and every one of you.\u201d</p> <p>Josey Gardner, 25, a protester and EMT studying English at BYU, asked: \u201cWhose bullets are they protecting us from? They are the only ones with guns.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>A chilling effect on free speech</strong></h2> <p>Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm is now organized into a pseudo-militia under the guidance of ex-military and ex-law enforcement on their newly formed board of advisers. They want Utah to be fully prepared for the \u201ccivil war\u201d instigated by underground, militant forces.</p> <p>The group trains tirelessly. When on site, members are advised to move in groups of three and no less, because they have been told by informants on the inside that antifa attacks single out the strongest members in vulnerable situations. They have escape plans at every site, and promote a firm obedience to the local police, including when asked by them not to come to a protest.</p> <p>(Provo police chief Rich Ferguson made a statement that the Provo police have no relationship with the Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm, which Sergeant Nisha King, head of the Provo police department\u2019s public information team, verified. )</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"caf98f9b075982816c0418e88550e6565c09639a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caf98f9b075982816c0418e88550e6565c09639a/0_0_4431_2954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Opposing protest groups march on opposite sides of the street in Provo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Opposing protest groups march on opposite sides of the street in Provo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Waggoner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, militia members have now been to almost every protest<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasatch_Front\"> on the Wasatch Front</a>. They come to protests throughout the state with anywhere between 30 to 1,000 members in full uniform (sometimes homemade, sometimes military-grade), some in bulletproof vests, and openly carrying ARs. They silently stand in the background and observe, always on guard believing they may be called upon to act quickly if something goes wrong.</p> <p>A protest in Taylorsville was cancelled because too many protesters felt the risk was not worth being there. Robertson took this as a win.</p> <p>Jason Stevens, of Utah\u2019s American Civil Liberties Union, stressed the importance of the historical context in what happened in the civil rights movement of the 1960s when armed groups, militias, local chapters of the Ku Klux Klan, white citizens councils, organizations both official and unofficial took it upon themselves to defend what they saw as their rights and property with violent and systemic intimidation and threats to African Americans and others in those areas.</p> <p>\u201cI am not saying that is what is happening here. But with context, if you are a protester and you see groups like this showing up at your protest, that\u2019s got to be in the back of your mind, this history of intimidation and threats.\u201d</p> <p>Outside of Utah, these threats are present and real for protesters. In Omak, Washington, small civilian militias are forming to threaten protesters. In New Mexico, there is another civilian militia group that call themselves the New Mexico Civil Guard reacting to rioting and looting.</p> <p>In Portland, the threats to free speech and the right to protest are coming from the federal government, which has deployed unidentified agents to quell protests by forcibly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/24/trump-goon-squad-john-sandweg-homeland-security-ice\">grabbing protesters and taking them away in unidentified vehicles</a>.</p> <p>BLM-adjacent groups held a \u201cStop Kidnapping Protesters\u201d event in Salt Lake City on 22 July, in reference to what took place in Portland. Robertson and his team came in full garb and made a live video. Robertson said: \u201cThat\u2019s the name of the protest \u2013 \u2018Stop kidnapping protesters\u2019. My boy over here translated it as \u2018stop arresting criminals\u2019. The awesome thing is these people that are out creating chaos and committing crimes, they are being watched. Law enforcement finally started to go around and pick them up and arrest them. I am all for it.\u201d</p> <p>Additionally, lines between the second and first amendment are complicated, especially as open-carry laws in Utah make it legal for groups of heavily armed individuals to gather in places where the first amendment is being honored, such as protests.</p> <p>\u201cIf the right to bear arms is overriding the right to free speech, that may be cause for concern,\u201d said Dr RonNell Andersen Jones, a law professor at the University of Utah. \u201cOur constitutional doctrine hasn\u2019t yet had the chance to really tussle with the question of what the presence of guns does to a free speech event. Short of more overt threats of violence, we usually protect protesters with guns in the same ways we protect protesters without them. But if the express goal of the armed individuals is to intimidate people who might otherwise share their views, that\u2019s especially troubling.\u201d</p> <p>In response to Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm, Utah protesters are now arming themselves. John Sullivan of Insurgence USA held his first armed protest on 22 July at the Utah state capitol, carrying an AR-15 and a magazine of ammo. He is encouraging Insurgence USA protesters to purchase guns so they can protect themselves if there is violence.</p> <p>\u201cBasically, nobody in our group owns a gun except for me; nobody was planning on ever shooting anyone. So the fact that I bought a bulletproof vest and more magazines and our people are buying guns should say a lot. It shouldn\u2019t be that way.\u201d</p> <p>Petit, who also organizes alongside BLM and Insurgence USA, has recruited ex-military to train and arm her protesters, because she feels the threat is real as long as Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm is showing up.</p> <p>\u201cThe only way forward is to make sure we are prepared, because at this point the options the only options available to us are when things go crazy we lie down and die, or we fight back.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not lying down for anybody.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The Premier League has decided that next week, black lives will matter. Or at least, it has decreed \u2013 at the behest of several club captains \u2013 that for the opening round of fixtures when the season resumes next week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/11/premier-league-shirts-to-show-support-for-black-lives-matter-and-nhs-minute-silence-coronavirus\">the phrase \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d can be borne on players\u2019 shirts</a>, in place of their names. It hasn\u2019t formally decided whether black lives will matter beyond next week or for the rest of the season. But rest assured it will be consulting key stakeholders and making an announcement in due course.</p> <p>All flippancy aside, it\u2019s perhaps instructive to mark out the steps that have brought us to this point. In and of itself, the shirt messages are a laughably piffling gesture: a bit of fabric stitched to another bit of fabric, a show of support with the emphasis on the former rather than the latter. Yet it\u2019s a gesture that would still have been inconceivable just a few years ago; perhaps even a few weeks ago, before the killing of George Floyd incited a wave of righteous fury that has challenged the very assumptions and orthodoxies upon which our society was built and in so doing forced all of us \u2013 sport included \u2013 to take a look at ourselves.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/12/sports-organisations-bame-board-members-systemic-racism-sporting-equals-arun-kang\">Sports organisations 'should have 20% BAME board members' to tackle racism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is no sudden awakening. It may feel a little like that from within the world of walled privilege where most of us reside. But for many of the athletes and fans who are now speaking up, this is simply the vocalisation of feelings and thoughts that have been poaching under the surface for some time, held in check by the fear of retribution, by the fear of backlash, by a society and a public discourse that has long cast anti-racism, not racism, as the real disruptive influence.</p> <p>All the same, this is a moment of genuine potential and one that thus needs to go well beyond talking. For the first time, people who have no interest in addressing racial inequalities are being confronted with its effects. A generation that has long revered Churchill as an emancipator and Geoffrey Boycott as the authentic voice of cricket and The Germans episode of Fawlty Towers as the pinnacle of British comedy is seeing its icons winched from their pedestals and given a dunking.</p> <p>And so, here we are: where a Premier League so allergically hostile to the discourse of politics, ethics and human rights that it allowed clubs to be purchased by nation states now feels obliged to align itself publicly against systemic racism, a phenomenon some people will still try to tell you doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s a small step. A clumsy and frustratingly infinitesimal step. But it\u2019s not quite nothing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/11/premier-league-shirts-to-show-support-for-black-lives-matter-and-nhs-minute-silence-coronavirus\">Premier League player names to be replaced on shirts by Black Lives Matter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over recent days no sport and no sporting body has been immune from reckoning, from a conversation about diversity or representation or demographic bias. Indeed, one of the great achievements of the Black Lives Matter movement has been to expose how racism operates in its totality: how an economy built on white exploitation and a self-image built on white supremacy generates white boardrooms and white administrations, how racism sustains itself through the nudge and the wink as much as the assault and the insult, how a well-meant sporting stereotype (\u201cpace, power, physicality\u201d) can spring from the same wilful blindness as a knee in the back of the neck.</p> <p>There has been plenty of talk about personal journeys and education processes, of enlightening some and reminding others of the inequities and iniquities that brought us to this point. Too many white athletes have been prepared to let their black teammates shoulder the burden, hiding behind a black Instagram square and some warm-sounding platitudes. By the same token, it has been deeply encouraging that some have been prepared to go beyond the usual spiel and grapple with these issues head-on. Hector Bellerin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/01/f1-drivers-respond-to-lewis-hamiltons-call-to-condemn-racism-george-floyd\">Daniel Ricciardo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/11/its-just-not-ok-jimmy-anderson-calls-on-cricket-to-raise-bame-representation\">Jimmy Anderson</a> and Jon Rahm \u2013 to name a few \u2013 have all spoken well.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/12/collin-osborne-and-paul-hull-i-dont-see-many-black-players-in-key-roles\">'It doesn\u2019t represent what England is': black coaches on rugby's glass ceiling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That process goes on. It needs to go on every day and every week, once the protests have died down and live sport has started again and the news agenda has moved on. It requires patience and intellectual curiosity and a willingness to look beyond the cosmetic. Addressing the lack of BAME coaches in English football, for example, is the sort of problem that could be fixed in a matter of months. So, too, the lack of non-white directors in major British sporting bodies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/12/sports-organisations-bame-board-members-systemic-racism-sporting-equals-arun-kang\">as revealed by a Sporting Equals study this week</a>.</p> <p>But chisel away a little deeper and the underlying issues remain untouched. The lack of black football coaches stems in part from a lack of black chief executives and sporting directors and owners. This stems in part from a systematic and racist assumption that black people cannot be trusted with positions of executive or financial power, one that also manifests itself in the lack of black representation in the judiciary, in business, in politics. This, in turn, has its roots in the historical concentration of wealth and power in white hands, often at the expense of enslaved or subjugated black peoples. Try and stitch that to the back of a football shirt.</p> <p>These are not pleasant conversations to have. They feel horrible and uncomfortable, just as they should. They require individuals and organisations to keep talking about racism long beyond the point when people have tired of hearing about it. It won\u2019t be polite. It won\u2019t be easy. But nothing this important ever is.</p>"

Too often, by default, black people are perceived as threats to white people\u2019s physical safety.&nbsp;And as a consequence, it is our physical safety that is compromised, as the stories of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/central-park-new-york-white-woman-black-birdwatcher\">Christian Cooper</a>, the birdwatcher who filmed a white woman in Central Park lying to the cops about how he was threatening her (when all he did was ask her to leash her dog), and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, the man who died with a police officer\u2019s knee on his neck, illustrate.</p> <p>I have backpacked around the world and lived in Nepal and Kenya, and I\u2019ve seen how my presence can be challenged or questioned. Earlier that year, when I lived in Seattle, I went hiking on Mt Baker with two white friends.&nbsp;It was a typically cloudy and cool day, and we stopped at the park lodge to warm up.&nbsp;At some point, my friends wandered off while I stood there with my colorful shawl wrapped around me.</p> <p>I began to feel uneasy; I noticed an elderly, white woman staring at me.&nbsp;Suddenly, she jumped (as did I).&nbsp;She then said: \u201cMy dear, I thought you were a beautiful, Indian statue.\u201d&nbsp;I was shocked, as I didn\u2019t know whether to feel complimented (you\u2019re beautiful) or insulted (I wasn\u2019t even real).&nbsp;Not to mention her complete misidentification of my racial and ethnic origins.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Regardless of my age and experience, I still feel unsafe walking outside in the country of my birth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My experiences backpacking through mountain trails and wildlife have forever changed the way I see and engage nature. I have channeled that passion into my work: I completed a PhD in geography, taught classes about the environment in our institutions of higher learning, written about the black experience of the outdoors, served on the national parks advisory board for eight years and work with environmental non-profits and government agencies on diversity and environmental issues.&nbsp;I am invested in finding ways to improve the quality of our relationship with the environment and our relationship to each other. But regardless of my age and experience, I still feel unsafe walking outside in the country of my birth.</p> <p>I wish I could feign surprise at what happened to Christian Cooper when he encountered Amy Cooper in Central Park.&nbsp;I wish I could imagine it to be a blip in the United States\u2019s history; an accident, an outlier, not at all reflective of the truth of how black people are all too often treated.&nbsp;But I can\u2019t.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Amy Cooper threatened to tell the police that \u201can <em>African American</em> man is threatening her life\u201d, she revealed what it\u2019s like to know, deep down in your bones that she would be protected, valued and saved by virtue of her skin color.&nbsp;By calling the police, she exemplified what James Baldwin meant when he said that whiteness is about power.</p> <p>Our outrage as black people is justified.&nbsp;Let me say that again.&nbsp;Our outrage as black people is justified. As the CNN commentator Don Lemon said recently: \u201cThe knee has always been on our neck.\u201d&nbsp;But your outrage, white America, is not enough. What many of us want is fundamental, consequential and absolute change.</p> <p>The response to Amy Cooper by a justifiably angry public \u2013 the demands for her to lose her job, her dog and perhaps some \u201cmembership\u201d in her community \u2013 is frustrating because it leaves me wanting.&nbsp;None of those measures would change the way Christian Cooper or any African American is perceived in any outdoor space, or any space for that matter.</p> <p>The revelations about Christian Cooper having gone to Harvard and how he sits on the board of the New York City Audubon Society (which I\u2019m thrilled to learn) should not matter as much as they seem to. This information helps us understand the passion and commitment he brings to birding. They do not confer his worth. At the end of day, it\u2019s about everyone being protected, valued and if need be, saved, regardless of their station in life.&nbsp;</p> <p>What happened between Amy Cooper and Christian Cooper was, in many ways, simply an echo of what\u2019s always been true in the US about our ability, as black people, to walk in the woods or on a city street.&nbsp;We are all Christian Cooper and George Floyd.&nbsp;</p> <p>What can be done? We should recognize that systemic racism exists on both the streets of our cities and inside our national parks. We have to see full representation at every level in the environmental sector, and we need power structures to shift so that black and brown people are shaping policies and our national conversations. We need predominantly white environmental organizations and academic institutions to be more concerned with how the climate crisis disproportionately impacts black and brown people and give more resources to these communities. We need to change the prison industrial complex and law enforcement, which both undoubtedly shape how black people move through space.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is not about political correctness. These changes must be the product of something learned, understood, believed in and practiced by our institutions, our leaders and our communities.</p> <p>I believe that this country \u2013 which was founded on slavery and stolen land \u2013 can make a different choice, the same way Amy Cooper could have made a different choice. And I can aspire to live in a place where I will not be seen as an anomaly or something to fear or challenge, but instead, am embraced as a reflection of our common humanity that doesn\u2019t deny our differences, but celebrates our possibilities.</p> <ul> <li><p>Carolyn Finney is the author of Black Faces, White Spaces: Reimagining the Relationship of African Americans to the Great Outdoors, and a scholar-in-residence at Middlebury College in Vermont</p></li> <li><p>The opinions expressed here are those of the author.

It is unclear how quickly this process could move, and what the transition could look like. Supporters are pushing for the council to start with taking money away from the police budget and investing in other government departments, social services and programs, while launching a community process for creating alternative systems.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>An alternative safety model, advocates say,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">can start</a>&nbsp;with finding \u201cnon-police solutions to the problems poor people face\u201d,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.citypages.com/news/minneapolis-city-council-members-consider-disbanding-the-police/570993291\">such as</a>&nbsp;counselors responding to mental health calls and addiction experts responding to drug abuse.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Like many US municipalities, Minneapolis was already facing a budget shortfall due to the Covid-19 crisis, and defunding police could help address some of those gaps. There are a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/be62ee3dee3094f2ecf8f841a198aadd?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP\">handful of examples</a> of governments disbanding troubled local police agencies in the US over the years, though the authorities have had other regional law enforcement entities take over policing.</p> \n<h2>Police reforms around the country</h2> \n<p>While the effort in Minneapolis is the most radical, a number of other US mayors and local leaders have reversed their positions on police funding.

The majority \u2013 though not all \u2013 said they wanted a peaceful protest.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/jun/02/in-1919-the-state-failed-to-protect-black-americans-a-century-later-its-still-failing\">In 1919, the state failed to protect black Americans. A century later, it's still failing | Carol Anderson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And so it was. Hamm, alongside Mayor Ras Baraka, and a few thousand people from the city and neighboring suburbs, marched through Newark. There were tense moments, and people throwing things at a police precinct, but \u2013 unlike many other protests across the US last weekend \u2013 there was no violence and no arrests.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not one thing that made [Saturday] turn out the way it did,\u201d Hamm said. \u201cIt\u2019s the history, it\u2019s all the things that happened, here, the people, all of this work.\u201d</p> <p>As images of police ramming their cars into protesters and beating people with clubs were shared thousands of times this weekend, a few videos of law enforcement marching or kneeling with protesters also appeared.</p> <p>These videos \u2013 some from majority black cities like Newark, New Jersey, and Flint, Michigan \u2013 were shared with messages about how police reform and police actions could de-escalate situations and lead to peaceful protests.</p> <p>But the images were also loaded with much more complex histories through which last weekend was a peek into the window.</p> <p>Newark residents like Hamm, for example, had been fighting this kind of violence for decades, including the 1967 riots, when thousands of residents took to the streets to protest about white police using excessive force and killing black civilians.</p> <p>When he became mayor in 2014,&nbsp;Baraka made police reform a priority. He worked with activists lawmakers to form an independent citizen review board of police activities. Newark hired more local and minority police, and trained them to American Civil Liberties Union standards, which limit use of force. Baraka pushed back against the city\u2019s powerful police union.</p> <p>Last year, Newark\u2019s crime rates dropped to an <a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/story/newark-crime-rates-continue-drop-its-much-about-perception-reality/\">unprecedented</a> low.</p> <p>\u201cThis relationship has been a nurtured one,\u201d Baraka said of bridging the communication gap between police and the Newark community, and that paid off last weekend when the tense protest ended without any arrests. \u201cThe police showed an uncanny level of restraint. They did not come downtown with tanks and body armor.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0563893ee41eeb30706ffdd3a18a9989eee6a4e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0563893ee41eeb30706ffdd3a18a9989eee6a4e2/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters rally against the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd, in Newark, New Jersey, on Saturday.

The event passed off largely peacefully.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeenah Moon/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nor was Newark unique.</p> <p>Less than a hundred miles away in Camden, New Jersey, the police chief, Joe Wysocki, and a handful of other police officers marched with protesters in the county they serve after activist Yolanda Deaver invited them.</p> <p>\u201cAt one point Yolanda was shouting Black Lives Matter, and she kind of looked at me, and I said: \u2018It\u2019s OK, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here,\u201d Wysocki said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Camden, touted by former president Barack Obama as a model for police reform, has also seen sweeping changes to its police force in the past decade. The county has introduced some of the strictest policies in the country regarding how police use force \u2013 strangling and suffocating, the way that police killed George Floyd in Minneapolis, are not tolerated.</p> <p>In Camden, police officers train in simulators that include racial bias testing, and commanders watch body-camera footage regularly and analyze officer behavior. Last year, the Minneapolis commissioner, John Harrington, who oversees community policing, even consulted with the Camden police to learn their protocols.</p> <p>But truly reforming the police often takes more than training, said Sam Sinyangwe, a data scientist and activist who co-founded Campaign Zero, a platform which<a href=\"https://www.joincampaignzero.org/\"> tracks</a> the impact of police violence and possible solutions. \u201cEven if you have a police chief or mayor who cares, they don\u2019t always have the power to hold the officers accountable,\u201d he said.</p> <p>There are a few policies that Sinyangwe said the evidence supports. There is not enough data, Sinyangwe said, to say that anti-bias training and classes are a solution. Instead, he points to strong restrictions on how police can use force, curbing the military-grade weapons distributed to the police and cracking down on police union contracts.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is also an increasingly important conversation about defunding the police, which lawmakers such as Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez have resurfaced this week. The $6bn New York police department, for example, is bigger than the city\u2019s budget for many housing, education and health initiatives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"309de1260912d3660f20cd41eafb10943daa4e08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/309de1260912d3660f20cd41eafb10943daa4e08/0_159_591_739/400.jpg\" alt=\"New York police officers kneel along with protesters after protesters said they asked them to do so, in this still frame obtained from social media video in Queens, New York, on Sunday.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New York police officers kneel along with protesters in Queens, New York, on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aleeia Abraham/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPart of police violence is policing of things that shouldn\u2019t be policed,\u201d Sinyangwe said, such as sending police to people having mental health crises. \u201cTo do that we have to make a divestment from policing and shift those resources.\u201d</p> <p>Without a cocktail of comprehensive policies and accountability, some of the police efforts to express solidarity have been less effective. When New York police kneeled at a protest on Sunday, some pointed out that they went on to use brutal force against residents an hour later.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Flint, Michigan, Sheriff Chris Swanson joined the protest last weekend, saying he wanted it to be a \u201cparade not a protest\u201d. The video went viral, and residents were relieved that nobody in the city, which is still dealing with a water and economic crisis, got hurt. But some said that the message felt like it only took away from the focus of the protest on George Floyd, especially since the community\u2019s relationship with the police was not strong.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people know that Flint has an understaffed police force. They\u2019re not really present,\u201d said Anthony Fisher, a 21-year-old student and native of the city. \u201cIt\u2019s a good gesture, but some people get carried away.\u201d</p> <p>For Hamm, in Newark, it was clear the uprising and unrest happening across the country is a culmination of years of police brutality against black communities. He said his group, which has held weekly protests on the issue for years, and its relationship with city leaders and clergy, set the stage for a demonstration that represented Newark.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWhen we marched there was already a kind of set of conditions in existence that would help prevent some sort of disturbance,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the power of George Floyd. The way he died has had a tremendous impact on people\u2019s consciousness.\u201d</p>"

The basic principle is that government budgets and \u201cpublic safety\u201d spending should prioritize housing, employment, community health, education and other vital programs, instead of police officers. Advocates argue that defunding is the best way forward since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">attempts to reform police practices</a> over the last five years have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/us-police-officers-fired-rehired-why\">failed</a>, as evidenced by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">brutal killing of George Floyd</a>.

That steady increase comes as crime has been consistently declining. In most cities, spending on police is <a href=\"https://populardemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Freedom%20To%20Thrive%2C%20Higher%20Res%20Version.pdf\">significantly greater</a> than spending on services and other departments ($1.8bn on police in Los Angeles, for example, which is <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-04/lapd-budget-cuts-garcetti-protests-explainer\">more than half</a> the city\u2019s general fund). The Covid-19 economic crisis has led cities and states to make drastic budget <a href=\"https://www.changethenypd.org/nycbudgetjustice\">cuts</a> to education, youth programs, arts and culture, parks, libraries, housing services and more. But police budgets have grown or gone largely untouched \u2013 until pressure from protests this week.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2><strong>How are lawmakers addressing the calls to defund?&nbsp;</strong></h2> \n<p>Almost overnight and in direct response to protests, some mayors and other elected leaders have reversed their position on police funding. The mayor of LA said he would look to cut as much as $150m from the police, just two days after he pushed forward a city budget that was increasing it by 7%. A New York councilman has called for a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCCouncil38/status/1268685464472621059\">$1bn divestment</a> from the NYPD. In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HelenGymAtLarge/status/1268893914074775552?s=20\">Philadelphia</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElectRyanDorsey/status/1268909453988020224?s=20\">Baltimore</a>, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/06/04/dc-city-council-janeese-lewis-george-election/\">Washington DC</a>, <a href=\"https://sf.curbed.com/2020/6/5/21281670/sf-mayor-defund-police-black-community-sfpd\">San Francisco</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rvp7OgYQ40zWjyhl15TLouRMCFhZ_ApjuJ5m1HmBurk/edit\">other cities</a>, local policymakers have expressed support for some form of defunding or opposing police budget increases. Most radically, in Minneapolis, council members have discussed potentially <a href=\"http://www.citypages.com/news/minneapolis-city-council-members-consider-disbanding-the-police/570993291\">disbanding the embattled police department altogether</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2020/06/02/heels-george-floyd-killing-colleges-have-moral-imperative-not-work-local-police\">Colleges</a>, public school <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/minneapolis-public-school-end-police-contract\">systems</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/museums-police-divest-black-lives-matter-1202690076/\">museums</a> and other institutions are also divesting from police.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cabaafe5c6116b4d05bfec2ea7481c43b1ade87\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cabaafe5c6116b4d05bfec2ea7481c43b1ade87/0_53_4873_2924/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman holds a placard reading \u2018Defund the Police\u2019 during a demonstration in Manhattan over the death of George Floyd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman holds a placard reading \u2018Defund the Police\u2019 during a demonstration in Manhattan over the death of George Floyd.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maria Khrenova/TASS</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>How do proposed cuts align with activists\u2019 demands?&nbsp;</strong></h2> \n<p>The change in direction is monumental, but the size of the proposed cuts is not, activists have said. In LA, Black Lives Matter has been pushing for a \u201c<a href=\"https://peoplesbudgetla.com/\">people\u2019s budget</a>\u201d that allocates just 5.7% of the general fund to law enforcement, instead of the 51% of the mayor\u2019s plan. More broadly, longstanding abolitionist groups, <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59ead8f9692ebee25b72f17f/t/5b65cd58758d46d34254f22c/1533398363539/CR_NoCops_reform_vs_abolition_CRside.pdf\">such as Critical Resistance</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mpd150.com/10-action-ideas-for-building-a-police-free-future/\">MPD 150</a>, argue that the cities should not be looking for minor savings and cuts, but should be fundamentally reducing the scale and size of the police force and dismantle the traditional law enforcement system. That <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">can start</a> with finding \u201cnon-police solutions to the problems poor people face\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.citypages.com/news/minneapolis-city-council-members-consider-disbanding-the-police/570993291\">such as</a> counselors responding to mental health calls and addiction experts responding to drug abuse.&nbsp;</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/defund-the-police-us-george-floyd-budgets\">Movement to defund police gains 'unprecedented' support across US</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>If cities defund police, will violence and crime increase?&nbsp;</strong></h2> \n<p>Abolition groups argue that policing and prison are at their core racist and harmful and make communities less safe. They also point out that the vast majority of police work has nothing to do with responding to or preventing violence, and that police have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2015/03/30/395069137/open-cases-why-one-third-of-murders-in-america-go-unresolved\">a terrible track record</a> of solving murders or handling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/10/sexual-assault-rape-kit-backlog-ignored-destroyed\">rape</a> and <a href=\"https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/public-safety/police-officers-who-commit-domestic-violence-often-get-to-keep-their-guns/\">domestic violence</a>.</p> \n<p>While there is no contemporary example of defunding in the US, there are studies suggesting that less policing could mean less crime. In 2014 and 2015, New York officers staged a \u201cslowdown\u201d to protest the mayor, arguing that if they did less police work, the city would be less safe. But <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/09/nyc-cops-did-a-work-stop-yet-crime-dropped/\">the opposite turned out to be true</a>. When the officers took a break from \u201cbroken windows policing\u201d, meaning targeting low-level offenses, there <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-proactive-policing-crime-20170925-story.html\">was a drop in crime</a>. Researchers posited that aggressive policing on the streets for petty matters can ultimately cause social disruption and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/09/nyc-cops-did-a-work-stop-yet-crime-dropped/\">lead to more crime</a>. Policing that <a href=\"https://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/the-high-cost-of-driving-while-poor/Content?oid=4269240\">punishes poverty</a>, such as hefty traffic tickets and debts, can also create conditions where crime is more likely. When New York ended \u201cstop and frisk\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/ending-new-yorks-stop-and-frisk-did-not-increase-crime\">crime did not rise</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>How are police unions responding to defunding calls?&nbsp;</strong></h2> \n<p>America\u2019s powerful police unions have <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/melissasegura/police-unions-history-minneapolis-reform-george-floyd\">long resisted even minor reforms</a> and accountability measures, and are predictably arguing, without evidence, that <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.com/2020/06/05/lapd-police-union-blasts-mayor-garcettis-killers-comment-and-proposed-budget-cuts/\">budget cuts</a> at any scale will make cities less safe. They\u2019ve <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/defund-police-ridiculous-idea-joe-gamaldi\">cited</a> looting and property damage amid protests this week to suggest that cities don\u2019t have enough officers. Defunding advocates, however, have pointed out that the highly militarized response to peaceful demonstrations and the aggressive and at times violent ways officers are handling protesters has only provided further evidence that police cause harm (when there is no public safety threat in the first place).&nbsp;</p> \n<h2><strong>Are there examples of police defunding that US cities can follow?&nbsp;</strong></h2> \n<p>America\u2019s legacy of racism and severe gun violence epidemic make it difficult to compare to other countries. But <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/defund-police/612682/\">some have pointed out</a> that compared to peer nations, the US spends significantly less on social services and more on public safety programs, and has astronomically higher incarceration rates. These investments in police and prison, however, don\u2019t translate to a safer country. In fact, police in America <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/09/the-counted-police-killings-us-vs-other-countries\">kill more people in days</a> than many countries do in years.&nbsp;</p>"

He also said Phil Murphy, another Democrat, \u201cdid a very good job in New Jersey\u201d.</p> <p>The president described Minnesota as \u201cour experiment\u201d in how to handle the protests.</p> <p>\u201cYou had the first part which was weak and pathetic,\u201d he said, \u201cand you had the second part which was domination.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also urged that states should enact laws against flag burning \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/background-flag-desecration-amendment#:~:text=Johnson.,protected%20form%20of%20free%20speech.\">first amendment right</a>.</p> <p>Trump repeatedly said the protesters were from the \u201cradical left\u201d and likened the protests to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/occupy-wall-street\">Occupy Wall Street</a> movement in 2011, speaking favourably of how those protests were forcibly put down.</p> <p>The response was mixed. Maine governor Janet Mills asked for Trump and his team to share intelligence on \u201cprofessional instigators\u201d from out of state, but also expressed concern about an upcoming visit by Trump.</p> <p>West Virginia governor Jim Justice, a Republican, said: \u201cYou come to West Virginia.

I\u2019m angry. And the fact is we need that anger, we need that to tell us to move forward, it helps us push through this pain to reach the other side, to hopefully greater progress, equality and inclusion and opportunity in our country.\u201d</p> <p>Across the country, protests have been mostly peaceful by day but some have turned violent at night, buildings set ablaze, shops looted, police firing rubber bullets and teargas. At least 4,400 arrests have been made, according to the Associated Press.</p> <p>The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced that there would be a curfew mandated for New York City Monday night 11pm until 5am Tuesday, and a doubling of policing.</p> <p>A man was killed in Louisville, Kentucky, after police and national guardsmen \u201creturned fire\u201d&nbsp;while dispersing a crowd. Democratic governor&nbsp;Andy Beshear&nbsp;said the incident would be investigated. In Indianapolis, two were reported dead, adding to deaths in Detroit and Minneapolis.</p> <p>Trump is facing widespread criticism for tweets starkly demanding \u201claw and order\u201d, threatening to unleash \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and blaming fringe leftwing groups for inciting violence.</p> <p>The president, also grappling with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic, did not appear in public on Sunday and was not scheduled to do so on Monday. There have been protests outside the White House for three days in a row. On Friday, Trump, his wife, Melania, and their son Barron were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/trump-flees-to-bunker-as-protests-over-george-floyd-rage-outside-white-house\">rushed to</a>&nbsp;a bunker previously used during terrorist attacks.</p> <p>On Sunday, after a peaceful daytime protest, police and national guardsmen faced supporters as an 11pm curfew approached, and then advanced firing teargas. Lights illuminating the White House were turned off, which typically only occurs<strong> </strong>when a president dies.</p> <p>Minneapolis had a largely quiet night after the police vigorously enforced an 8pm curfew, shutting all main highways through the city. A lot of side streets were shut off by makeshift barricades erected by residents seeking to protect their homes. The police blocked junctions.</p> <p>Only a small number of people appeared to defy the curfew, including a group of several hundred who maintained a vigil at the place where Floyd was held for nearly nine minutes with police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on his neck. The street is now a memorial filled with flowers.</p> <p>On Monday the family of George Floyd, 46, released the results of a private autopsy they arranged, which concluded that Floyd died by homicide caused by \u201casphyxiation by sustained force\u201d. They called for the third-degree murder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">charge</a> against former officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck, to be upgraded to a first-degree charge and for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-killing-three-officers-charges\">three other officers</a> involved to be arrested for \u201cthe part they played\u201d in the man\u2019s death.</p> <p>Last week preliminary results of the official autopsy, released by the county medical examiner, had found that Floyd\u2019s died because of the \u201ccombined effects of Mr. Floyd\u2019s being restrained by police, underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system\u201d.</p> <p>Elsewhere, though, violence returned. In Birmingham, Alabama, a Confederate statute was toppled. Protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails in Philadelphia and were hit with teargas in Austin, Texas. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalised.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, offered advice to the protesters.</p> <p>\u201cIf, going forward, we can channel our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action, then this moment can be a real turning point in our nation\u2019s long journey to live up to our highest ideals,\u201d he wrote in a Medium post.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators marched in cities across the United States on Saturday in what were some of the largest protests yet seen in the unrest triggered by the killing of George Floyd by a white Minneapolis police officer.</p> <p>At the same time, a long line of people, some chanting \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d, waited outside a church in North Carolina for a memorial service for Floyd as ceremonies to mark his life and mourn his death continued.</p> <p>In Washington thousands gathered at <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/after-week-of-protest-saturday-expected-to-bring-largest-crowds-yet-to-washington/2020/06/05/dd4e7362-a6ca-11ea-bb20-ebf0921f3bbd_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_5\">numerous rallies&nbsp;</a>, from the Lincoln Memorial, to Freedom Plaza, to Capitol Hill. The atmosphere was peaceful and full of chanting and shouting, though there was a heavy security presence, including members of the national guard.</p> <p>The White House also now stands behind a new, reinforced fence, lending an element of siege to a presidency, city and country in turmoil after a fierce debate about racism and police brutality was triggered by Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/06/george-floyd-killing-washington-march-protests-second-memorial-service-donald-trump-live-latest-updates\">George Floyd killing: Washington expecting biggest march yet as mourners prepare for second memorial service \u2013 live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Washington had prepared by closing certain streets to vehicles and telling drivers to avoid coming into the city if possible.</p> <p>Thousands gathered at different spots around the city in the early afternoon, and started to converge into one large demonstration. Hundreds of protestors kneeled for nine minutes outside a Senate office building, in homage to Floyd.</p> <p>In some places in the city the atmosphere seemed almost like a street party, as TV showed images of demonstrators talking to soldiers standing in combat fatigues next to their Humvees. In another protest, players and staff members for the NFL\u2019s Denver Broncos&nbsp;marched from the state capitol to the Civic Center park downtown.</p> <p>\u201cWe as a black community need our white brothers and sisters to explain to the rest of the white brothers and sisters out there what it means for \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019,\u201d said player Justin Simmons.</p> <p>In New York City, multiple protests emerged in the late morning, as they have every day for more than a week. A group of teachers marched in downtown Manhattan holding up a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emma_a_whitford/status/1269299214267355141?s=20\">banner</a> that read \u201cBlack Students Matter\u201d and signs demanding an end to the school-to-prison pipeline.</p> <p>A demonstration packed Washington Square Park with thousands later in the afternoon.</p> <p>Protests unfolded in many other cities as the day continued.</p> <p>Thousands marched through the streets of Chicago, chanting and waving signs. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said she was hopeful that peaceful protests would continue through the weekend, but a nightly curfew remained in effect. The city also hired three private security firms to protect shops, grocery stores and pharmacies.</p> <p>In Philadelphia, thousands of people demanding justice for Floyd marched peacefully through the city chanting \u201cNo justice, no peace!\u201d Demonstrators gathered near the Philadelphia Museum of Art and its celebrated \u201cRocky\u201d steps, then set off for city hall, where they chanted at police officers and national guard members.<br><br>About 100 protesters gathered at Donald Trump\u2019s golf resort just outside Miami in a protest organized by Latinos for Black Lives Matter. Many carried signs saying \u201cvote him out\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t be a bunker boy\u201d, the latter a reference to reports that the president went into the White House bunker when protests in Washington grew more violent.</p> <p>While previous days of protests have seen violent crackdowns from police against protestors, Saturday\u2019s huge demonstrations have so far appeared peaceful as huge crowds move through their city\u2019s streets.</p> <p>In North Carolina, a hearse carrying Floyd\u2019s body arrived Saturday morning for a public viewing of his casket and private memorial held in Hoke county in the southern state. Hundreds of people from the area came to pay their respects. A group of mourners on horseback visited the church in tribute to Floyd.</p> <p>Floyd was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina \u2013 a city just east of Hoke county. Though he spent much of his life in Houston, much of Floyd\u2019s family is still there, the Charlotte Observer <a href=\"https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article243301776.html\">reported</a>. Only family members were invited to a funeral to be held in the afternoon, though it was broadcasted live.</p> <p>The governor of North Carolina ordered flags to be raised at half-staff on Saturday in Floyd\u2019s honor.&nbsp;</p> <p>The memorial in North Carolina is Floyd\u2019s second. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/george-floyd-memorial-minneapolis\">memorial</a> was held at a university in Minneapolis, two miles from where Floyd was killed. A third and final <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/06/02/george-floyd-funeral-memorial-services-burial-planned-three-states/3122453001/\">memorial</a> will be held in Houston, where Floyd will be laid to rest.</p> <p>Meanwhile, two Buffalo police officers pleaded not guilty to assault&nbsp;after video emerged of them&nbsp;<a href=\"https://content.guardianapis.com/atom/media/dbefd615-3a3a-42d6-ba32-25d1000dda85\">pushing a 75-year-old</a>&nbsp;to the ground during protests over Floyd\u2019s death. The man was shown bleeding after striking his head as he fell.</p> <p>When the police officers left the court building earlier on Saturday, they were greeted by dozens of their colleagues who were cheering for them.</p> <p>Aaron Torgalski and Robert McCabe have both been suspended over the incident, which was viewed millions of times on social media and triggered widespread rage. Buffalo police initially said the man had tripped during a confrontation but the city\u2019s mayor later condemned the incident.</p>"
