He died in the same metro area as Philando Castile. He uttered the same final pleas as Eric Garner.&nbsp;</p> <p>The nationwide unrest that follows Floyd\u2019s death is undoubtedly more intense than in 2014; the leadership from the White House immeasurably more reckless, insensitive and life threatening.&nbsp;</p> <p>And yet, here the country is again.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump\u2019s response was a marked departure from the Obama administration\u2019s</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Violence against black men and women at the hands of white authority is foundational to the United States, and continues to influence its policing culture to this day.</p> <p>Precursors to modern-day American police departments include violent <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0021934717702134\">slave patrols utilized in southern states</a> before the civil war, then the legal enforcement of racist Black Codes, followed by Jim Crow laws. Early municipal departments in growing US cities were overwhelmingly white, and brutalized vulnerable communities routinely. Thousands of lynchings of black Americans by white vigilantes went unpunished by the judicial system. And during the civil rights era and well beyond, peaceful protest has been harshly suppressed by officers sworn to protect and serve.&nbsp;</p> <p>Just days after I sat with Samaria Rice on that bench in Cleveland, Donald Trump accepted the Republican party\u2019s nomination for president a few miles down the road. &nbsp;</p> <p>Trump presented himself as the \u201claw and order\u201d candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/republican-convention-cleveland-donald-trump-fear\">during a dark acceptance speech</a>. The former Milwaukee sheriff David Clarke <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4612553/user-clip-sheriff-david-clarke-speech-rnc-2016\">led the arena in a chilling round of applause</a> for the Baltimore police officer Brian Rice, who that day had been acquitted on charges related to the death of Freddie Gray, whose spine was almost severed during his 2014 arrest. Trump thrust the issue of race and policing firmly into the culture wars he was fomenting. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s response to police violence was a marked departure from the Obama administration\u2019s. Since Michael Brown\u2019s death, which began a nationwide reckoning and rejuvenated the Black Lives Matter movement, Obama had used his authority to target problematic police departments, including those in Ferguson, Chicago and Baltimore, with justice department investigations.</p> <p>He <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/05/18/407631522/obama-to-limit-police-acquisition-of-some-military-style-equipment\">issued an executive order</a> to curtail local departments\u2019 procurement of certain military-grade equipment. He commissioned a taskforce on 21st-century policing, which <a href=\"https://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/taskforce/taskforce_finalreport.pdf\">memorably urged American law enforcement</a> to move from a \u201cwarrior\u201d to a \u201cguardian\u201d culture.&nbsp;</p> <p>Although America has a sprawling, decentralized system of policing \u2013 the country has <a href=\"https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/nsleed.pdf\">roughly 18,000 police departments</a> each with their own use of force policy, hiring practices and oversight mechanisms making universal reform near impossible \u2013 there were at least signs of tentative progress.&nbsp;</p> <p>And then Donald Trump became the 45th president of the United States.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump's chaotic presidency diverted attention from the debate around police killings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Not only did he <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/49ers/trump-anthem-protesters-get-son-b-field\">fight a PR war against those who knelt during the national anthem</a> to pay tribute to black lives lost and stand against the structural racism underpinning it all. Now a man who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/central-park-five-donald-trump-jogger-rape-case-new-york\">called for the death penalty against five black and brown teenagers wrongfully convicted of a rape in Central Park in 1989</a>, had the ability, with a stroke of a pen or a nod to his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to undo any of the progress made.&nbsp;</p> <p>The administration acted quickly. Within two months of assuming office, Sessions <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/954916/download\">forced a sweeping review of court-enforceable reform packages</a> \u2013 known as consent decrees \u2013 imposed on numerous problematic police departments.

     "body": "<p>In a 2017 episode of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2467372/\">Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a>, the acclaimed police comedy show, Sergeant Terry Jeffords (played by Terry Crews) is racially profiled while walking in his own neighbourhood. He later tells his captain, Raymond Holt (played by Andre Braugher), who is also black, that he wants to lodge a complaint. Captain Holt responds that he should not; doing so will make it difficult for him to advance in the NYPD, which comes with the prospect of making an even bigger change. This is also the route, Holt explains, that he took: he endured years of abuse as the only black, gay detective to become police captain so that he might make the NYPD less racist and anti-queer. In either case, the culprit is clear: racism in the NYPD. The solution is equally clear: change from within.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/10/netflix-pulls-the-mighty-boosh-and-the-league-of-gentlemen-over-blackface\">Netflix pulls The Mighty Boosh and The League of Gentlemen over blackface</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is one of the more progressive of the crime genre\u2019s Black Lives Matter episodes, by which I mean those episodes that were clearly written in response to the movement, which started in 2013, against a racist state and state-sponsored violence. Consider, for instance, the 2015 episode of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3560060/\">CSI: Cyber</a> in which the protagonists respond to a video of the police shooting an unarmed black man, only to discover that the cops did not kill him, absolving them of all guilt. (Other shows with BLM episodes include Law and Order, <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/chicago-pd\">Chicago PD</a> and more.) By contrast, Brooklyn Nine-Nine seems radical.</p> <p>Yet even this episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine disseminates the myth that there are good cops and bad cops, and that if there are enough good cops, the police will no longer kill us. This belief that police reform will end racist violence dates at least as far back as the 1950s, as political scientist Naomi Murakawa documents in <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-first-civil-right-9780199892785?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\">The First Civil Right</a>. It also runs counter to the demands to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">defund the police</a> in cities across the United States and divert resources to useful ends, such as social work and healthcare. Even the best copaganda can\u2019t bring itself to ask for less investment in the police, let alone to limit its power.</p> <p>The crime genre\u2019s general support of police has led some thinkers and writers to condemn such shows. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/25/law-and-disorder-how-shows-cloud-the-public-view-of-criminal-justice\">Color of Change\u2019s report</a> Normalizing Injustice, Rashad Robinson writes, in the foreword: \u201cThe crime genre glorifies, justifies and normalises the systematic violence and injustice meted out by police, making heroes out of police and prosecutors who engage in abuse, particularly against people of colour.\u201d Consequently, the report recommends that crime shows ought to address state, and state-sponsored, racism and to hire more diverse staff with a wider variety of experiences of the prison industrial complex, among other things. The industry on the whole, the report continues, should develop new standards for the crime genre and hold show-runners accountable for producing racist shows.</p> <p>Other writers and thinkers have begun to wonder if cultural reform is possible, or whether the crime genre is racist by nature. Writing for the Washington Post, Alyssa Rosenberg agrees with Color of Change\u2019s recommendations but also suggests that networks should <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/04/shut-down-all-police-movies-tv-shows-now/?arc404=true\">stop making cop shows and movies</a> altogether. Somewhat surprisingly, network executives seem to agree. After 32 seasons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/09/cops-tv-show-cancelled-police-protests\">Paramount has finally cancelled Cops</a>, the famously violent, voyeuristic show that splices together documentary footage of real-life policing. The mood-change on the streets, in other words, may be coming to our screens</p> <p>While I have neither an attachment to the crime genre nor any qualms with cancelling all such shows, I do think there is another option: viewing these shows critically and educating others to do the same. Just as the journalist and scholar <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/doublej/music-reads/features/hip-hop-and-feminism-joan-morgan/10883398\">Joan Morgan</a> argued that feminists can listen to hip-hop without accepting or reproducing its sexism, so, too, can audiences watch the crime genre while rejecting its racist premises.</p> <p>Consider, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/04/the-most-powerful-piece-of-film-criticism-ever-written/359996/\">James Baldwin\u2019s writing</a> about the famous 1967 cop film,<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061811/\"> In The Heat of the Night</a>. The film stars Sidney Poitier as a Philadelphia detective working on a case in Mississippi, who is subjected to racism from the locals and from his white partner while solving a crime. The racist partner eventually comes to respect Poitier; the force may be anti-black, the film admits, but one good black detective in pursuit of justice is enough to change the mind of one white racist and, perhaps, the world. After Baldwin<em> </em>notes all the ways in which the movie was wildly implausible, he writes, \u201ca black man, in any case, had certainly best not believe everything he sees in the movies\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>We need to teach more viewers to be like Baldwin because the troubling beliefs upholding the prison industrial complex are not just limited to the crime genre. Many 20th-century African-American novels, for instance, upheld and disseminated the myth that police violence only affects black <em>men</em>. In The Long Dream (1958), Richard Wright represents such violence as castration, while <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/ralph-ellisons-invisible-man-as-a-parable-of-our-time\">Ralph Ellison\u2019s Invisible Man</a> (1951) gives no attention to the <a href=\"https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-183991926/margie-polite-the-riot-starter-harlem-1943\">historical incident of police violence against Margie Polite </a>in its representation of the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Harlem-race-riot-of-1943\">Harlem riot of 1943</a>, which Polite\u2019s treatment sparked. A careful reader with a little knowledge of history, however, knows that the police also persecuted black women such as Jessie Mae Robinson, to say nothing of many others. Critical reading and viewing, in other words, can succeed even where popular culture fails.</p> <p>To better interrogate cultural material about the police, people need to be better educated about them, as well as about what police and prison abolition means: uprooting the prison industrial complex and producing new systems to keep people safe and hold people accountable. For those looking for a place to start, read black feminist scholars and activists such as <a href=\"https://squareonejustice.org/expert/beth-richie/\">Beth Richie</a>, <a href=\"http://mariamekaba.com/\">Mariame Kaba</a>, and Andrea Ritchie, who have revealed the police\u2019s racist, sexist, and anti-queer distribution of violence. And read <a href=\"https://www.biography.com/activist/angela-davis\">Angela Davis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/magazine/prison-abolition-ruth-wilson-gilmore.html\">Ruth Wilson Gilmore</a>, whose work on abolition has made it possible to imagine a world without the prison industrial complex, a world other than the one that crime shows insist we must live in. After you\u2019ve done so, regardless of whether or not you laugh at the episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, you\u2019ll know not to believe everything you see.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Elias Rodriques is a PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania.

When I looked and saw people in Germany marching for George Floyd, it\u2019s a different time and different season. When they went in front of the parliament in London, England, and said it\u2019s a different time and a different season, I come to tell you, America this is the time of building accountability in the criminal justice system.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sharpton said he remembered going to a march years ago and being confronted by a white woman who looked him in the face and said: \u201cNigger, go home\u201d.

We\u2019ll keep going until we change the whole system of justice.\u201d</p> \n<p>Protesters also gathered outside the courthouse where the three officers, charged with aiding and abetting the officer who kneeled on Floyd\u2019s neck, made their first court appearance around the same time.</p> \n<p>The three officers, Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao, were fired last week and charged earlier this week after the state took over the case from the county prosecutor. Chauvin, who kneeled on Floyd\u2019s neck, and who was also fired, was charged with third-degree murder last week and had the charge upgraded to second-degree murder on Wednesday by the Minnesota attorney general.</p> \n<p>Thousands of people who had joined protests over the past week to demand justice for Floyd were asked to keep away from the service, amid concerns about social distancing during the ongoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic.</p> \n<p>Ahead of the start of Thursday\u2019s official memorial event, Floyd\u2019s body lay in a golden casket surrounded by white flowers.

We have to be a part of this part.\u201d</p> \n<p>After the service, Floyd\u2019s body will be flown to Raeford, North Carolina, where Floyd was born, for a public viewing and private family service on Saturday.</p> \n<p>Another public viewing will be held in Houston, Texas, where Floyd grew up and lived much of his life, before a private burial there.</p>"

The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations. They had different perspectives, different understandings of right and wrong. But those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults. To tear them down would be to lie about our history, and impoverish the education of generations to come.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson said it was \u201cabsurd and shameful\u201d that Churchill\u2019s statue had to be protected, calling it \u201ca permanent reminder of his achievement in saving this country \u2013 and the whole of Europe \u2013 from a fascist and racist tyranny.\u201d</p> \n<p>The prime minister, who has written a biography of Churchill, added: \u201cYes, he sometimes expressed opinions that were and are unacceptable to us today, but he was a hero, and he fully deserves his memorial.\u201d</p> \n<p>Questioned about Johnson\u2019s comments, his spokesman was ambiguous as to whether he believed no statues should be removed under any circumstances.</p> \n<p>Asked if this was the case, the spokesman said: \u201cI think the PM\u2019s tweets speak for themselves,\u201d and referred the media to the tweet saying removing statues would be to \u201clie about history\u201d.</p> \n<p>But then asked whether statues could be removed by local consent, the spokesman said: \u201cAs he said earlier this week, there are democratic processes for this sort of thing, and that\u2019s what should be followed.\u201d</p> \n<p>The spokesman also made plain that while Johnson had referred to Churchill\u2019s \u201cunacceptable\u201d opinions, the PM had no plans to apologise for his own previous racially charged comments, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/02/boris-johnsons-burqa-comments-led-to-surge-in-anti-muslim-attacks\">such as describing</a> veiled Muslim women as \u201cletterboxes\u201d and \u201cbankrobbers\u201d, and writing about African people\u2019s \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d.</p> \n<p>Asked if Johnson would apologise, the spokesman said: \u201cThese issues were all addressed during the election campaign last year.\u201d Asked if the prime minister still believed it was correct to \u201cspeak frankly\u201d in such ways, the spokesman said: \u201cYes\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36d2575f1466747e6603d9b2096bbb3bde8637e4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36d2575f1466747e6603d9b2096bbb3bde8637e4/0_87_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Cenotaph war memorial in Whitehall, central London, being boarded up on Friday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Cenotaph war memorial in Whitehall being boarded up on Friday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Far-right groups, with the support of extremists such as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, who calls himself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/tommy-robinson\">Tommy Robinson</a>, are planning to hold a \u201cdefend our memorials\u201d event at Churchill\u2019s statue on Parliament Square this weekend.

I just can\u2019t understand the mentality of a person who would want to damage it. We will not let that happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Brecon in mid-Wales, a plaque to the slave ship captain Thomas Phillips has been ripped down.

The record of state failures to protect blacks and others against police brutality is all too full. Ditto the looting and arson, killings and general eruption of racial violence in many American cities when injustices occur.\u201d</p> \n<p>An editorial <strong>Le Monde</strong> <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2020/05/30/etats-unis-aux-sources-de-l-embrasement_6041274_3232.html\">paints a similar picture</a> of structural racism and police brutality by police and others against black Americans.</p> \n<p>\u201cGeorge Floyd and Eric Garner are not isolated victims. The list is too long to give here of these black American men of all ages, who are too often victims of encounters with the police that turn out badly; of the trigger-happy in a country where firearms are routinely carried as an accessory, or just plain racism.</p> \n<p>\u201cToo many mothers in the African American community must teach their sons from early adolescence how to behave on the street so as not to arouse suspicion and not to be in turn the target of blunders or mistakes. Too many black joggers in big cities know that covering their heads with the hood of their sweatshirts or ignoring, because they have headphones on their ears, an audible warning to stop running exposes their lives to danger.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>El Peri</strong><strong>\u00f3dico</strong> in Barcelona also points to a <a href=\"https://www.elperiodico.com/es/opinion/20200530/editorial-trump-calienta-la-calle-7981349\">history of endemic racism in the US</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe truth is that what happened in Minneapolis, recorded on video and viewed worldwide through social networks, is just the&nbsp;latest proof that the racism epidemic is far from being controlled, and<strong> </strong>that&nbsp;the two Barack Obama administrations did nothing to cauterize any wounds.<strong> </strong>On the contrary, they&nbsp;fueled the desire for revenge&nbsp;in many communities, with a deeply rooted racist culture, which saw its time come in November 2016 with the victory of a far-right Republican candidate.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many commentators are doubtful that Trump has the skills or even political capital to emerge as a healer. In an analysis, Edward Keenan, Washington bureau chief of the <strong>Toronto Star</strong>,<strong> </strong>is pessimistic that even if the president did make a speech, as some of his allies have been urging, there is <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2020/05/31/no-justice-no-peace-already-in-crisis-america-lurches-toward-chaos.html\">nothing he could say to defuse the situation</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven if Trump were inclined to try to heal the nation with some kind of address, as some have called for him to do, it is hard to imagine anything he could say that would de-escalate the situation rather than be read as a provocation by the protesters.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is no obvious end point to the unfolding crisis. After months of the coronavirus and days of civil unrest, Americans are bracing themselves for more chaos in the days and weeks ahead.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d14b7887-7d31-4026-9de8-038d512039f2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b2Mdnx1VxBg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>The Times</strong> of London, in its <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-times-view-on-the-george-floyd-protests-uneasy-america-g7s8vszgc\">leader</a> on Monday, draws a similar conclusion pointing to Trump\u2019s incendiary style:</p> \n<p>\u201c2020 comes with its own complications, and one of them is in the White House. On Friday, after first having called Floyd\u2019s death \u2018shocking\u2019, President Trump took to Twitter to threaten a military response against \u2018thugs\u2019 in Minneapolis and quipped: \u2018When the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u2019 In a remarkable first, the social media network flagged the tweet as \u2018glorifying violence\u2019.</p> \n<p>\u201cAfter demonstrations spread to the White House, the president threatened any protester breaching barriers with \u2018the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen\u2019 and appeared to be calling for his own supporters to rally to meet them. Politically, identifying enemies puts Mr Trump into his comfort zone. Rather than pouring oil on troubled waters, he has opted for petrol.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/mr-president-dont-go-hide-china-goads-us-over-george-floyd-protests\">'Mr President, don't go hide': China goads US over George Floyd protests</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Not all commentators, however, have come to the issue entirely lacking an agenda, not least in China, which has been locked in a fractious war of words with Washington over coronavirus and other issues.</p> \n<p><strong>The Global Times</strong> \u2013 under the headline \u201cGeorge Floyd murder exposes rotten racism in the US\u201d \u2013 is <a href=\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1190140.shtml\">predictably scathing</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn a year of elections that are particularly important for Trump, votes from the black community do not matter that much. After all, Trump won just 8% of African American voters four years ago. Black voters are always the base of the Democratic party. So as protests escalate across the country, Trump played the same old political games by shaming Minneapolis\u2019 Democrat mayor and retweeting an account urging Minnesotans to vote Democrats out of office. As the pandemic gets severe, the economic card doesn\u2019t work any more for Trump. Passing the buck is his trump card.\u201d</p> \n<p>South Africa\u2019s <strong>Mail and Guardian</strong> meanwhile has <a href=\"https://mg.co.za/africa/2020-06-01-soon-hell-be-seen-as-threatening-not-cute-what-its-like-to-raise-my-black-son-in-america/\">Ifrah Udgoon</a>, a US Somali immigrant, writing about her fears for her black son.</p> \n<p>\u201cBlack mothers have much to fear when it comes to their children. American soil is saturated with the blood of black people: slavery, Jim Crow, mass incarceration and the war on drugs, and police brutality have ensured that black people know pain and loss intimately \u2026</p> \n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t see just a man in a single moment when we look at George Floyd. We see America\u2019s entire racial history culminating into that one moment.\u201d&nbsp;</p>"

But his route was very different and went through Lafayette Square</a>. Moments before, peaceful protesters, priests and families among them, had been assaulted by national guardsmen and federal officers: gassed, shot with rubber bullets, forcefully cleared from the president\u2019s path.</p> \n<p>With a small group of aides, his daughter Ivanka among them, the president walked to St John\u2019s, the so-called Church of the Presidents, to be photographed by the press, holding aloft a Bible.</p> \n<p>The president had ordered an assault on his own citizens, in order to stage a PR stunt.

Every president since James Madison has worshipped there. It is a national treasure. On Sunday, as protest churned, it was briefly threatened by fire.</p> \n<p>The president wanted to show Washington was under his control. He also wanted to reassure a key bloc of support.

Trump used it to taunt political opponents, rant about the need to dominate protesters, call for mass arrests and threaten to call in the army. Tellingly, he said: \u201cWashington was under good control, but we\u2019re gonna have it under much more control \u2026 we\u2019re gonna clamp down very, very strong.\u201d</p> \n<p>The call promptly leaked to media outlets, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/donald-trump-protests-george-floyd-dominate\">the Guardian among them</a>.</p> \n<p>As controversy spread, according to the Axios website, advisers \u201chotly debated\u201d whether Trump should finally address the nation.

Finally, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1267580557141184513\">tweeted</a> that he would speak in the White House Rose Garden.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am your president&nbsp;of law and order,\u201d he&nbsp;said at the podium, striking a firmly Nixonian note, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/13/donald-trump-1968-election-violence-chicago-richard-nixon\">as he has on the campaign trail</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country.

     "body": "<p>Cynthia Nixon Zooms on to my screen from some decking in Long Island. The blue-grey sky is dramatically ominous, a sea breeze blows her hair into photogenic chaos and she is, of course, pretty damn famous \u2013 especially to those of us of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/aug/02/sex-and-the-city-series-one\">Sex and the City</a> generation. So the overall effect is of watching a film, but one that is talking straight to you. Yet, within what feels like barely five seconds, we are discussing the end of democracy, with only the briefest detour to cover the impact wrought on her New York home by coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re in New York City, what it reminds me of is the time right after September 11th. It was, in a way, less terrifying than it looked to people watching from the outside, just as it\u2019s strangely less scary to have cancer than to watch someone you love have cancer.\u201d</p> <p>She packs a lot into a sentence \u2013 history, terrorism, love, cancer \u2013 and is clearly political to her bones: not at all interested in things that simply happen (pandemics and their attendant disruptions) but instead in systems, choices and worldviews. \u201cIn terms of the overall political scene across the country, it\u2019s just terrifying. People keep writing these articles about the end of democracy, and it does feel like a real possibility when you have a president who\u2019s trying to sink the Post Office.\u201d</p> <p>At 54, Nixon is a relatively recent discovery as a prominent advocate of the Democratic party\u2019s furthest left: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/13/andrew-cuomo-cynthia-nixon-new-york-primary\">she stood against Andrew Cuomo in the 2018 election </a>for the governor of New York, a race in which she now considers she was doomed from the start. \u201cI was triply burdened,\u201d she says. \u201cI was a woman. I was a gay woman. I was a person who had been an activist for a long time, but had never held political office, and obviously the governor is a really big place to start. And I am an actress, which is a barely coded word for \u2018bimbo\u2019 or \u2018ditz\u2019. I don\u2019t, in my personal life, ever call myself an actress \u2013 I call myself an actor. But Cuomo tried to use that word as often as he could, in a very derogatory way.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b506fd6a1017decf7a6a40a38ccd5b9f3ed0b5f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b506fd6a1017decf7a6a40a38ccd5b9f3ed0b5f6/0_248_2000_1574/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nixon with her wife, Christine Marinoni, at the 2018 New York City Pride march\" width=\"1000\" height=\"787\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nixon with her wife, Christine Marinoni, at the New York City Pride march in 2018, the year she stood as candidate for governor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gotham/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But, as she points out, her political work pre-dated the gubernatorial challenge by many years. She has long been a fierce defender of public education, which is how she met her wife, the education activist Christine Marinoni, having separated from her previous partner, Danny Mozes, a teacher with whom she has two children, in 2003 (she has a third with Marinoni). </p> <p>Her political stance was, originally, to defend public institutions from privatisation \u2013 a critique that will be very familiar on this side of the Atlantic. \u201cWe\u2019ve been aware for decades how much politicians want to underfund the schools, partly because they don\u2019t care, because they send their own children to private schools.\u201d But through the intersection with her personal life, the tendrils of this progressive agenda reached into LGBTQ rights, women\u2019s rights, trans rights \u2013 her oldest child is transgender \u2013 and Black Lives Matter (BLM). Six months ago, she made <a href=\"https://uk.video.search.yahoo.com/yhs/search?fr=yhs-iry-fullyhosted_011&amp;hsimp=yhs-fullyhosted_011&amp;hspart=iry&amp;p=girls+girls+girls+cynthia+nixon#id=2&amp;vid=ad84331b7b37929b16c9924b2a809f17&amp;action=click\">a video that went viral for Girls Girls Girls</a>, the American feminist magazine. Be a Lady, They Said is a short, impassioned and caustic polemic, written by Camille Rainville, about the double (triple, infinite) standards applied to femininity (my favourite line: \u201cBe a size zero. Be a double zero. Be nothing. You look emaciated!\u201d).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>America has never reckoned with its slave past, with its Jim Crow past, with its white supremacist past</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She speaks powerfully about the BLM movement and the hope that it has brought in such dark times. \u201cHow many Americans of every ethnicity and race and age have come out in support of the BLM marches? The last estimate I heard was 20 million people, in every part of the country. Hope is hard. Every person who\u2019s killed [by police] is really heart-wrenching for me, so I can\u2019t imagine, if you\u2019re a black person or you\u2019re the mother of a black son, what it\u2019s like. So it\u2019s weird to say \u2018hopeful\u2019. But America has never reckoned with its slave past, with its Jim Crow past, with its white supremacist past. And now it is. The dichotomy is MAGA [Make America Great Again] versus BLM.\u201d You could never mistake Nixon for a celebrity adding her voice to various movements out of disinterested goodwill: activism is her driving force; her fame when she talks about it \u2013 if she talks of it at all \u2013 seems more like an accident.</p> <p>Perhaps that sounds counterintuitive, given how long she has spent in showbiz. Born in Manhattan to a journalist father and actor mother in 1966, she had her first role at the age of 12 in ABC\u2019s children\u2019s special The Seven Wishes of a Rich Kid in 1978, and appeared on Broadway in a revival of The Philadelphia Story at 14. When she took the role of Miranda Hobbes in Sex and the City in 1998, it was on the back of an already very well-established career on stage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ba23addcde998cda8caa9d8288eb6860e502ba17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba23addcde998cda8caa9d8288eb6860e502ba17/0_0_2688_1772/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cynthia Nixon with the rest of the central cast of Sex And The City in 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"659\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cynthia Nixon (second right) with the rest of the central cast of Sex And The City in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Startraks Photo/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Viewers were obsessed with SATC, to the extent that the tiniest details of the casts\u2019 assorted lives were considered newsworthy (did they bicker off set? Did they hang out together? How like their characters were they <em>really</em>?) And much was made of the fact that Nixon was nothing like Miranda \u2013 she had a very happy family life, a man, kids, the works, while her character was a commitment-phobe, and she had had quite a seamless journey to success, while her character\u2019s career arc was frantic and thwarted.</p> <p>Looking back on that performance, though, there was something about it that was true to the actor\u2019s own sensibility. She was the one who made it watchable for people who didn\u2019t care about shoes or think that marriage was a goal in itself; she was the element of female friendship that didn\u2019t correspond, or have much to say to, the heightened, camp versions of femininity that the show otherwise embodied. </p> <p>Even though Nixon has a pretty staunch critique of her industry as a whole \u2013 \u201cWe have a long history in the entertainment business of putting marginalised people in front of a camera, but the people who are writing their lines have no idea about their experiences\u201d \u2013 she talks warmly of her time as part of it. As well as many other things, acting is, for her, the place where the personal can have political impact, where the warmth that is generated by the creative process burns through to the audience. \u201cThat camaraderie that you have, not only with other actors but with the crew, it\u2019s hard to describe,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it creates a feeling that is transmitted on to the screen.\u201d And, in turn, that changes the way people see one another.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are so many of us gay people on TV now, we are so popular, it's hard for people to believe we are evil and twisted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is a point she makes specifically about homophobia and its gradual extinction: \u201cI was involved in the fight for marriage equality,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd it was really interesting how finally, in the end game, the anti-LGBT forces had painted themselves into a corner. Their message was: \u2018We are under attack, this is an anti-straight person movement. If this happens, your kindergarteners are going to have to watch pornographic films of same-sex couples going at it, your church is going to have to have disgusting weddings in their sanctuaries.\u2019 And \u2013 I watched it happen \u2013 the vilification of gay people stopped working. In a way in which the vilification of black people never stopped working, and the presentation of abortion as murder never stopped working. Even if you live in such a conservative neighbourhood that no one has come out to you, television is full of us. Maybe you love Elton John, maybe you love Ellen DeGeneres. There are so many of us, and we are so popular, that it\u2019s hard for people to believe that we are evil and twisted.\u201d</p> <p>She notes, however, that all that hostility didn\u2019t just disappear: it has now been focused on trans people, and the fight has taken on the same contours. \u201cThere are many things that the right uses against trans people, and a lot of them have to do with a threat. \u2018There\u2019s going to be a man in your women\u2019s bathroom.\u2019 It\u2019s the most preposterous thing in the world. \u2018They\u2019re going to rape you and they\u2019re going to molest you and they\u2019re going to make you use pronouns.\u2019\u201d If it is ever implied that she feels especially strongly about trans issues because her son is transgender, I feel moved to point out that she feels this strongly about everything.</p> <p>Nixon was a very vocal supporter of Bernie Sanders in the 2016 democratic leadership race, and still maintains that he had a better chance against Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton ever did. \u201cWe had this weird swing voter who voted Obama but also voted for Trump. But maybe it wasn\u2019t weird. These people are desperate for change, they didn\u2019t want Hillary Clinton. They didn\u2019t want continuity.\u201d</p> <p>She is no great fan of Clinton, nor the factions of the party that got her the leadership: \u201cThey did everything they could to make sure Sanders was not the candidate, they just jumped on him and killed him.\u201d But she deplores the misogyny directed at Clinton as much as she would have had she shared her politics. \u201cSo much of the hatred of her was wrapped up in her femaleness. Insert adjective here \u2013 \u2018coldness\u2019, \u2018aloofness\u2019, \u2018smugness\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b53948483a1ef602475d4bef32b794bfe4400717\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b53948483a1ef602475d4bef32b794bfe4400717/34_96_5692_3415/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nixon joins Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to celebrate the latter\u2019s election to Congress in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nixon joins Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to celebrate the latter\u2019s election to Congress in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Heins/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You could similarly imagine Nixon being less than 100% behind Joe Biden \u2013 whichever way you cut it, he is not a left-wing firebrand \u2013 but, in the moment, she sounds as though she is very much sticking to the progressive hymn sheet on this: \u201cHe\u2019s our candidate,\u201d she says, trenchantly.</p> <p>Looking back at the words themselves, though, she has a much more complicated stance, and I was struck by a skill that is more politician\u2019s than actor\u2019s: the ability to leave an impression of having said a thing that isn\u2019t quite what you said. \u201cThere is a real war going on in the Democratic party,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd those of us who are, you know, supporters of Bernie and AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] are very sure that we are the future of the party. But there are so many retrograde forces trying to hold back the tidal wave.\u201d</p> <p>However, for anyone in the US who is not on the right, there are bigger problems than fighting one another: the prospect of Trump winning a second term, or even if he doesn\u2019t, the peaceful transfer of power. \u201cI do feel frightened about his malevolent high jinks,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel concerned about interference from other countries; I think everyone feels concerned about postal votes. Will he leave quietly? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>She also shares an anxiety that even quite optimistic Democrats are voicing; that Trump\u2019s absurd positioning as the law-and-order candidate might actually work. \u201cTrump\u2019s only path to re-election is to position himself as defender of white people and white lives and white supremacy. To say; that\u2019s one alternative, and the only other alternative is chaos, and looting and an end to the suburbs. The fact of the matter is, big cities almost always vote Democrat, particularly in national elections, because we\u2019re very diverse and we have so many more poor people. But Trump is spinning this narrative that all our major cities are failing, because they\u2019re run by Democrats.</p> <p>\u201cThe Republicans have run out of solutions to big cities. They just say: \u2018You\u2019re Sodom and Gomorrah, may you all go up in flames.\u2019\u201d That doesn\u2019t, however, amount to her repudiating protests \u2013 a lot of the violence is driven by rightwing provocateurs, she says \u2013 and still less has she given in to despair. \u201cI do feel relatively optimistic.

Nixon plays Nurse Ratched\u2019s nervy lover, in what might be her most on-brand casting ever: a feminist retelling of \u201cthis great movie, which has aged unbelievably well, but is also unbelievably misogynist \u2013 boys being boys and this humourless, castrating mother figure, abusing them. Nurse Ratched is always on the list of top 10 movie villainesses, so this series asks the question, is she a monster? And if she\u2019s a monster, what happened to her? How did she become that monster?\u201d</p> <p>Ryan Murphy and Evan Romansky\u2019s show is set in the late 40s and early 50s, and it is, says Nixon, their \u201cway of commenting on this period in American history that\u2019s supposed to be our apex, our moment of tremendous prosperity and optimism and opportunity. When Trump says \u2018make America great again\u2019, this is the moment he wants to return to.</p> <p>\u201cBut for so many Americans, it was deeply malevolent and sadistic. There was a complete betrayal of African Americans coming back from the war, the dressing down of women who had their power retaken from them, the lavender purge of gay and lesbian workers \u2026 And that\u2019s before you consider mental illness, and who gets to define what is and isn\u2019t mentally ill. As queer people, we\u2019re very aware of the essence of us being defined as an illness for so long.\u201d</p> <p>This is, paradoxically, where the source of her optimism shines through, more than any talk about which way the polls are going \u2013 where her actorly and activist personalities meet, in creative curiosity.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80213445a\">Ratched</a> starts on Netflix on 18 September</p>"

They are the words of a dictator.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s speech sowed fear and uncertainty, not least because of its vagueness. Legally, he would have to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act for active-duty troops to conduct law enforcement on US soil, but he does not appear to have done so yet.</p> \n<p>It is possible that, for now, he is using it as a threat to force the hand of state governors to call up more troops from the national guard, just as he used the Defense Production Act to push companies to manufacture ventilators for people with coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Politically, he would face intense criticism from Democrats but he probably assumes that, as ever, Republicans will remain in lockstep with him. There were few signs of dissent on Monday night from within his own party.</p> \n<p>The alarming development ended days of speculation over how the president, already overwhelmed by the coronavirus pandemic, might respond to the most widespread civil unrest in America in more than half a century.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-cities-burned-trump-stayed-silent--other-than-tweeting-fuel-on-the-fire/2020/05/31/4fc8761a-a354-11ea-b619-3f9133bbb482_story.html\">Media reports suggested</a> heated debates among White House officials over whether Trump should deliver an Oval Office address. In the end, there was a familiar winner: Trump himself.</p> \n<p>The choreography of his remarks in the White House Rose Garden and protesters being roughed up just outside was a made-for-television moment around the time of the evening news. Trump remains a reality-TV impresario.</p> \n<p>The darkness of his tone was also true to his instincts. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/billmaher/status/1104842415808995328?s=20\">His authoritarian tendencies</a> include a love of military parades, putting his name on buildings, hiring family members, staging populist rallies, berating the media and threatening to \u201clock up\u201d political opponents.

The couple are thought to be among those urging the president to exercise restraint.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jared Kushner but probably it\u2019s Jared channelling his wife, who doesn\u2019t want to give her father bad news or challenge her father, so she\u2019s making Jared do it,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.mullings.com/\">Rich Galen,</a> former press secretary to Dan Quayle, an ex-vice-president.</p> \n<p>But there was a fundamental problem, Galen added. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell the president anything because he won\u2019t listen and, even if he pretends to listen, he\u2019ll just go off and do what he wants anyway.\u201d</p> \n<p>Earlier in his presidency, Trump was surrounded by military figures, including chief of staff John Kelly and national security adviser HR McMaster, who might have found ways to thwart his strongman posture. Now such guardrails are gone and the president\u2019s inner circle is compliant.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/outrageous-christian-leaders-reject-trump-use-of-church-as-prop-during-george-floyd-protests\">Bishop 'outraged' over Trump's church photo op during George Floyd protests</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.chriswhipple.net/\">Chris Whipple,</a> author of The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency, said: \u201cThis is someone who has never empowered anyone to tell him what he does not want to hear and the result is a complete failure of leadership.

     "body": "<p>The publishing industry is stilted and archaic. I worked in it for seven years, and left due to reasons I can\u2019t legally talk about. Though, in that time, I was able to enforce and oversee&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;steps towards sustainable change. At 4th Estate, an imprint of HarperCollins, I started the Guardian 4th Estate BAME Short Story prize (still going strong, five years later). Staggered by the lack of underrepresented voices, I knew I had to do something, <em>anything</em> to give those voices a way to permeate the industry.</p> <p>It is taken for granted that would-be writers will know what a literary agent is. But most have no idea how to structure a book proposal, or where to send it. This information is possessed by those in the know, and the people in the know often want to keep it to themselves. Let\u2019s talk about literary agents for a second; they are, effectively, tastemakers. Editors trust them to deliver books and authors that adhere to their (sometimes limited) taste. And what happens when these arbiters continue to work within the circles of writers who they already know? The same thing that always happens: books that follow trends, that look the same, that are written by the same kinds of people.</p> <p>Following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> protests across the world, sparked by the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/08/george-floyd-protests-black-lives-matter-donald-trump-defund-police-latest-news-updates\">George Floyd</a>, one agent at Curtis Brown tweeted: \u201cMaybe, there will now be a desire to read new voices and listen to the unheard and buy the books by those who \u2013 up to now \u2013 have been ignored by the mainstream.\u201d But who is the mainstream, if not an agency as large and commanding of the literary space as Curtis Brown?</p> <p>The curiosity to hear new voices has always been there. The desire to learn about unheard stories has&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;been there.&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jan/26/fiction.zadiesmith\">White Teeth</a></em>&nbsp;by Zadie Smith was published to critical acclaim and commercial success in 2000. My novel&nbsp;<em>Queenie</em>&nbsp;has shown how a south London girl\u2019s story can be loved in the UK and in the States (and it took until 2019 for a story like hers to reach the mainstream).&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/11/ordinary-people-diana-evans-review-couples-marital-angst-black-mixed-race\">Ordinary People</a></em>&nbsp;by Diana Evans, published in 2018 and shortlisted for the Women\u2019s prize, details exactly what the title suggests: the ordinary lives of a black and an interracial couple. We\u2019re trying to tell these stories, but it\u2019s as if the industry only allows a few of us to do so at one time.</p> <p>For all its workshops and meetings, the publishing world is only just starting to put the work in to printing stories by black writers, and there are still so few on the shelves. So who has really been ignoring these writers, and these stories, up until now? Who should the onus be on here? Is it not the tastemakers? I won\u2019t ever say that these things are too little, too late. There\u2019s time to make long-standing change, but it has to come from the right place. And that place is understanding the role that the industry has been playing, up until now, in ignoring and suppressing black voices. </p>"

It was a career littered with violent incidents.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 2011 he and four other officers were placed on leave after they shot and wounded an indigenous man. The same year, Chauvin was part of a team that responded to a domestic violence call where the suspect was shot, although not by Chauvin.&nbsp;</p> <p>Chauvin shot and wounded Ira Latrell Toles during a domestic abuse call in 2008, the Minnesota newspaper<a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/a-deeper-look-at-the-four-officers-fired-after-george-floyd-death/570885592/?refresh=true\"> the Star Tribune reported</a>, and in 2006 Chauvin and five other officers were involved in the shooting death of Wayne Reyes, who allegedly pointed a shotgun in their direction.</p> <p>Away from his police career, Chauvin had worked security at a Minneapolis dance club, the Star Tribune reported. His former manager there said he had been the subject of complaints from customers.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen him in action and I\u2019ve seen him lose it and I\u2019ve called him out on it before,\u201d Maya Santamaria told the newspaper.&nbsp;\u201cI\u2019ve told him it\u2019s unnecessary and unjustified some of the ways that he behaves.

     "body": "<p>With the US presidential election looming, equal rights groups and others on the left say the protests<strong> </strong>sparked by George Floyd\u2019s death can translate into a surge in young people voting in November.</p> <p>While Donald Trump\u2019s autocratic response to the demonstrations has shocked young people into action in the US and beyond, advocates believe the movement against police brutality has energized youth voters to think beyond the presidential election, which could have a real impact on state and local elections, where decisions about policing and criminal justice are made.</p> <p>Around the country, people running for local office say they are already seeing a spike in enthusiasm among 18- to 29-year-olds, who historically vote in smaller numbers than their elders.</p> <p>\u201cI have so many young kids reaching out to our campaign, saying: \u2018How do we volunteer, can I intern to learn more, I\u2019d really like to run for office,\u201d said Nada Elmikashfi, a 24-year-old <a href=\"https://www.nadaforwisconsin.com/\">candidate for state senate</a> in Wisconsin.</p> <p>\u201cI think whatever political apathy afflicted our generation, it isn\u2019t a choice any more.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Elmikashfi, who has been part of protests in Madison, Wisconsin\u2019s capital city, said the brutal death of Floyd has \u201cbrought a lot of attention on down-ballot races\u201d, but she isn\u2019t sure whether that enthusiasm will carry over to the presidential election, where Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate, has faced criticism for his responses to the demonstrations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"64da25304afa6480725db6d2252d97f1fce0dac3\"> <img

</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFrom conversations that I\u2019ve been having with people my own age, and whether this is right and wrong, it\u2019s this idea that the Democrats are putting Trump as \u2018This is the sole reason you should vote for us\u2019,\u201d Elmikashfi said.</p> <p>\u201cI think constituencies across the country are put in a tight spot, where you have a fascist president who is incredibly destructive to America, but then you also have Democratic party leadership that isn\u2019t very progressive, that doesn\u2019t uplift the working class, but that feels entitled to your vote.</p> <p>\u201cYoung kids understand Trump is more damaging, the question is: is it really gonna change under Biden.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s reaction to Floyd\u2019s death, and the ensuing surge in protests nationwide, has <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-biden-police-oversight-board/\">included him musing</a> that police officers could shoot suspects in the leg, \u201cinstead of in the heart\u201d, a suggestion that seemed to overlook the issue of people of color being apprehended at far higher rates than white people.&nbsp;</p> <p>The former vice-president, who is 78 years old, struggled to attract young supporters during the Democratic primary, weighed down by a problematic record that includes <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/politics/biden-busing.html\">opposing bussing minority students</a> to different school districts, and his lead role in a 1994 \u201ctough on crime\u201d law that some <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/20/18677998/joe-biden-1994-crime-bill-law-mass-incarceration\">blame for mass incarceration</a> in the US, and seems in danger of misjudging the level of emotion and the desire for change.</p> <p>\u201cThe death of George Floyd is emblematic of everything that\u2019s wrong with America, whether it\u2019s how we handle Covid, to the existing racism and police brutality that black and brown communities have suffered for years,\u201d said Moumita Ahmed, who is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/disruptionary?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">running for district leader</a> in New York\u2019s 24th assembly district.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ahmed, 30, said Floyd\u2019s death, along with the recent killings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ahmaud-arbery\">Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html\">Breonna Taylor in Kentucky</a> had \u201copened eyes for a lot of young people\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe younger generation are just so much more aware and active and ready to make a difference,\u201d said Ahmed, who co-founded the group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bernlennials\">Millennials for Bernie</a>, which supported Bernie Sanders during his 2016 and 2020 election campaigns.</p> <p>\u201cI think a lot of people are going to start paying attention to local elections,\u201d Ahmed said.</p> <p>\u201cThe federal government can do a lot, but the local government has a lot of power in the police departments. They can do so much more than the federal government.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7b0ca4e9eda2ac42616f59cc6154c9624401930d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b0ca4e9eda2ac42616f59cc6154c9624401930d/0_0_3900_2600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather near the makeshift memorial in honor of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 1 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather near the makeshift memorial in honor of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on 1 June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is precedent for protest movements prompting real change. In recent years the youth-led protests against gun violence following the Parkland school shooting, led to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/12/26/18145305/gun-control-violence-parkland-effect-2018\">stronger gun laws</a>, while young climate activists <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/the-weekly/democrats-climate-change-green-new-deal.html\">succeeded in drawing attention to the Green New Deal</a> environment legislation, which many Democratic politicians have since endorsed.</p> <p>On Monday George Floyd\u2019s brother, Terrence Floyd, called for people to vote in November, particularly in statewide and local elections like Ahmed and Elmikashfi\u2019s. That effort to build on the energy of the past two weeks is being supported by organizations like <a href=\"https://www.organizing20.org/\">Organizing 2.0</a>, <a href=\"https://nextgenamerica.org/\">NextGen America</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.naacp.org/\">NAACP</a>, which aims to build equal rights in the US.</p> <p>Tiffany Dena Loftin, director of the <a href=\"http://naacpyc.org/\">NAACP youth &amp; college division</a>, said it has been registering people to vote at demonstrations, demonstrate how the voting process works and help people find their voting precincts. Loftin said young people had been stunned by Trump\u2019s advocating of violence against protesters and \u201cencouragement of police violence\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat is resonating with young black voters across the country, they\u2019re paying attention,\u201d Loftin said.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re fed up and they\u2019re done. So that is definitely a motivation to go to the polls. I want to be clear \u2013 it\u2019s not a scare tactic. We\u2019re not afraid of Donald Trump being president for another four years.\u201d</p> <p>Loftin said the NAACP has also encouraged people to take part in the 2020 census, a once-a-decade event that will influence the amount of government funding neighborhoods receive, and potentially how they are represented in Ccongress. Like Ahmed and Elmikashfi, she said local races are just as important as the headline-grabbing Trump v Biden election.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a laser focus on district attorney races, mayoral races, district races, the president and what their decisions are going to mean for how black folks in this country walk and experience their everyday lives.\u201d</p> <p>The importance of participating in elections was on the minds of people at a protest in New York City on Tuesday, where thousands walked through Manhattan to demonstrate at Gracie Mansion, the official residence of Mayor Bill de Blasio.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s another stage of this movement that does need to happen. I think voting is important,\u201d said Justin Withers, 23.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that this does change the voting. I hope it does. We\u2019ve failed in the past but I hope now because it\u2019s so many people that people will finally wake up.\u201d</p> <p>Just 46.1% of 18- to 29-year-olds <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html\">voted in the 2016 presidential election</a>, compared with an overall turnout of 61.4%. The highest turnout, meanwhile, was among people aged 65 and over, who are statistically more likely to be conservative.</p> <p>In the 2018 midterms, the less glamorous elections that re-elect members of the House of Representatives and some senators as well as local officials, 36% of young people voted \u2013 although this was a big increase on the 20% of 18 \u2013 29-year-olds who voted in the 2014 midterms.</p> <p>That could suggest interest and awareness is growing among younger voters. Although Withers, who lives in Brooklyn, predicted that despite renewed enthusiasm, the turnout in 2020 would remain relatively low among people of color \u2013 due to efforts in states around the US to make it more difficult for black people, and other minority groups, from voting.&nbsp;</p> <p>Since <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html\">the Voting Rights Act was weakened</a> in 2013, many states have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2019/nov/07/which-us-states-hardest-vote-supression-election\">brought in laws making it more difficult to vote</a>, from purging people from electoral rolls if they have not voted in a given amount of time, to preventing efforts to register voters, to requiring government-issued photo ID to vote \u2013 something people of color and low-income Americans <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/getting-a-photo-id-so-you-can-vote-is-easy-unless-youre-poor-black-latino-or-elderly/2016/05/23/8d5474ec-20f0-11e6-8690-f14ca9de2972_story.html\">are less likely to have</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is voter suppression is still happening,\u201d Withers said.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still 10 times harder for the people who know what\u2019s right, for the people who are minorities, to be able to vote. That\u2019s still a problem. And because of that I know that it won\u2019t be the numbers we want.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p><strong>Did you read Andrea Levy\u2019s Orange prize-winning novel before coming to this production?<br></strong>I had an interesting journey leading up to this play; I auditioned for a part in the TV adaptation of Levy\u2019s The Long Song and as part of the research for that I watched [the TV adaptation of] Small Island on iPlayer. A few months later, I was auditioning to play Hortense in this production. I picked up the book and couldn\u2019t put it down. It was quite an adventure to go on. I was reading it in the knowledge that I\u2019d be playing this character so I was looking for secret nuggets for the part.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I never met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/15/andrea-levy-obituary\">Andrea Levy</a>, which I\u2019m always going to be sad about. When I did a workshop in October 2018 she was too ill to be there but she was deeply involved in this adaptation. She wanted Rufus Norris to direct it and Helen Edmundson to adapt it.</p> <p><strong>Edmundson\u2019s adaptation is a mix of dialogue, direct address to the audience, narration and song. How easy was it to burst into song or through the fourth wall?<br></strong>It was a tall order, especially for actors who hadn\u2019t been on that stage [the Olivier theatre] before \u2013 it\u2019s a massive space. I open the play with a song, then I go into a scene with dialogue then all of a sudden I go into a direct address to the audience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3c9a62cbde30af4c10d5ee3a8d26b88f2e065384\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c9a62cbde30af4c10d5ee3a8d26b88f2e065384/0_0_2953_3853/766.jpg\" alt=\"CJ Beckford (Michael) and Leah Harvey (Hortense) in Small Island by Andrea Levy at the Olivier, National Theatre.\" width=\"766\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">CJ Beckford (Michael) and Leah Harvey (Hortense) in Small Island by Andrea Levy at the Olivier, National Theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I remember working on that first scene in rehearsals. When it came to the direct address, I had to turn around to speak to the audience. I wasn\u2019t on stage at the time but I knew what it looked like. I turned around and just curled up into a tiny ball on the floor. I felt so exposed. Everyone laughed at the strong physical reaction.</p> <p>What it ultimately did [in the drama] was to open up a dialogue between the audience and the main characters. Later on in the play, we had people shouting things out like \u201cYes, that\u2019s right!\u201d or talking quietly among themselves. One person would guffaw at something that another person found offensive and that\u2019s tense. I heard that being in the audience was an experience in itself.</p> <p><strong>Marriage is a disappointment for Hortense, who marries Gilbert out of expediency. and also for Queenie, who marries the emotionally repressed Bernard. Is this a comment on marriage for women in the 1940s and 50s?<br></strong>I\u2019ve always wanted Hortense and Queenie to have a cup of tea together and chat, because they have so much in common. They both get married to men they don\u2019t know or get along with that well. They marry to escape the situation they\u2019re in; Hortense marries Gilbert to travel to the \u2018Motherland\u2019 and Queenie marries Bernard so she doesn\u2019t have to keep working in a stinking farm. But I think in both marriages they have the power.</p> <p><strong>A central part of Gilbert\u2019s story relates to the West Indian soldiers who fought in the British army during the </strong><strong>second </strong><strong>world </strong><strong>war and then became part of the Windrush generation, post</strong><strong>war. Did the play acquire new meaning for you in the light of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a> of 2018? <br></strong>Yes of course. We are playing pretend but the Windrush scandal makes it real. When <a href=\"https://www.curtisbrown.co.uk/client/shiloh-coke\">Shiloh Coke</a> and I first put on our costumes we both said \u2018I feel real\u2019. These clothes were what our aunties and grandmothers would have worn. Naturally, it makes you look at your own family and how it affected everybody. My grandmother turned 80 while I was rehearsing: she came to England from St Lucia and is a member of the Windrush generation. I was trying to work her out at the time and as she was giving a speech on her birthday, I thought \u2018That\u2019s Hortense!\u2019</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krhsav6hCPE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/krhsav6hCPE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>Jon Driscoll\u2019s projection of rolling ocean waves in the backdrop as well as film footage of people stepping off HMT Empire Windrush is very visually striking. How did it feel to perform against this backdrop?<br></strong>I didn\u2019t see much of it until I watched the NT Live version of the play and then I thought \u2018Wow, I\u2019ve been missing out on so much!\u2019 The sea is actually the Caribbean \u2013 they went there and filmed it.</p> <p><strong>Do you think this drama has gained greater resonance in the light of the global protests and recent resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement?<br></strong>I think it would always have meant something very big to a lot of different people, but now it bears even more resonance. It\u2019s important we share these stories, full stop, but to make the play available \u2013 and globally available \u2013 for one week at this moment could be so big but overwhelming to think about. Even if there\u2019s one person on the other side of the argument who gains some empathy or a different perspective by watching it, then it\u2019s done something good.</p> <p><strong>Bernard Bligh is openly and vehemently racist to Gilbert, who experiences a lot of hostility and aggression in Britain and says that \u201cthis country is full of people like Mr Bligh</strong><strong>\u201d.

I am sure will be doing that over the next few days to make our actions speak as loudly as our words. It\u2019s a tiny minority, as any form of hooliganism or racism always has been, because the vast majority come to football in peace.

It read: \u201cWhile we naturally consider that all lives matter, let us be clear that the Black Lives Matter movement aims to overcome years of racial inequality against the BAME community and promote a greater fairness for all. We at Burnley therefore stand firmly behind it and oppose anything that may appear to undermine or challenge such a positive message.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>In 2016, the writer and lawyer Michelle Alexander said the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, would come to be seen as a \u201ccritical turning point. If it winds up not being a turning point, it will be because we did not do our job.\u201d Nearly two months on since the death of George Floyd, Black Lives Matter has become one of the largest demonstrations in history, but it is still not clear whether a turning point has been reached.</p> <p>If I have one reason to be optimistic, it is that hundreds of people have written to me asking: what can I do? There is a renewed awareness of racial disproportionality in criminal justice systems, a subject Alexander explores in <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/23/new-jim-crow-mass-incarceration-in-age-colourblindness-michelle-alexander-review\">The New Jim Crow</a></strong>. She makes a chilling comparison between the Jim Crow laws in the United States following the civil war, which segregated the newly emancipated black population, and the country\u2019s system of mass incarceration today, in which one in three black men are sent to prison.</p> <p>The US is often cited as the centre of racial injustice, but the relationship between criminal justice and racial injustice is global. Edited by Justin Healey, <strong>Indigenous People and Criminal Justice </strong>examines the disproportionality of indigenous imprisonment in Australia. Healey\u2019s research is a vital piece of work on decolonising a criminal justice system in which the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island population account for 27% of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/jun/12/new-data-on-the-unfair-policing-of-indigenous-people\">Australia\u2019s prisoners</a>, despite making up less than 3% of the total population.</p> <p>During the coronavirus crisis, prisoners have been subject to an emergency lockdown regime that has seen offenders in England and Wales spending 23 hours a day in their cells, without access to education, rehabilitation or visits. Measures to limit the spread of Covid-19 are vital, but without a comprehensive plan to relax these extreme policies, prisons could start to resemble <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/23/charles-dickens-favourite-bleak-house\">Bleak House</a></em>. Charles Dickens published the first instalment of this satirical portrait of a decaying British judicial system in 1852. Today, <em>Bleak House</em> reads less like satire and more like an omen. After cuts to the Ministry of Justice of a quarter in real terms over the past decade, our outdated system is starting to look dystopian even by Dickensian standards.</p> <p>As cuts deepen, the backlog of criminal cases grows, leaving defendants sitting in their cells waiting for a trial. Defendants such as Walter McMillian, who was sentenced to death in Alabama in 1988 for killing a white woman, serving six years before his conviction was overturned. In his powerful memoir, <strong>Just Mercy</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/01/bryan-stevenson-americas-mandela\">Bryan Stevenson</a> tells McMillian\u2019s story and recalls his own struggles against injustice as a young lawyer. Thankfully, we do not have the death penalty in the UK. But our backlog of 41,000 criminal cases means some people are being <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-justice-system-prisons-court-probation-latest-uk-a9430666.html\">held on remand</a> for an even longer period than they would serve if convicted of their alleged offence.</p> <p>Our system is creaking because its foundations have been weakened by a decade of underfunding. In<strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/28/secret-barrister-stories-law-review-justice-system\">The Secret Barrister</a></strong>, an anonymous criminal advocate exposes deep faults in our legal system. As a former barrister myself, I know that junior professionals working on legal aid cases come from a variety of backgrounds, and often work in impossible conditions. If we fail to support these people, we fail to support those who rely on them the most. In the wake of Black Lives Matter, no prizes will be awarded for guessing which defendants, victims and communities will end up paying the price.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Tribes by David Lammy is published by Constable (\u00a320).

     "body": "<p>In August, as a giant bouncy castle was throwing a shadow on Warsaw\u2019s baroque-style Ujazd\u00f3w castle \u2013 home to the Centre for Contemporary Art \u2013 a party was under way. It was the last event in the To Be Real programme, one day aimed at maximising the space\u2019s fleeting inclusivity of Poland\u2019s LGBTQ+ community. One of the artists was running late. \u201cI came almost straight out of jail and played probably the most aggressive set in my life,\u201d says DJ and producer Avtomat.</p> \n<p>A day earlier, he had been arrested at a protest against the pre-trial detention of an LGBTQ+ rights campaigner known as Margot. <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/08/07/poland-crackdown-lgbt-activists\">Human Rights Watch described the government\u2019s violent crackdown on activists</a> as an attempt to crush dissent against state-sanctioned homophobia: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/12/polish-president-issues-campaign-pledge-to-fight-lgbt-ideology?fbclid=IwAR3THOhservqNZrHmgS0-yNmq7P8zNOXOla_0FhHfvvagMJg8Z15PWZX49E\">the ruling Law and Justice party has pledged to fight \u201cLGBT ideology\u201d</a> to protect the so-called traditional Polish family unit.</p> \n<p>The rhetoric has been at the centre of its 2020 presidential campaign, fuelling prejudice and hate crimes throughout the country. In the past year, more than a third of Polish towns have declared themselves \u201cLGBT-free zones\u201d. In July, <a href=\"https://www.o2.pl/informacje/polowanie-na-gejow-pod-krakowskim-klubem-brutalny-atak-6529136458758880a\">two men and a woman were brutally beaten</a> outside a gay club in Krak\u00f3w. A week after To Be Real, the new director at the Ujazdowski, one of Poland\u2019s main cultural institutions, began his event curation by booking the neo-Nazi Hungarian band Hungarica, which was then cancelled after a public outcry. Director Piotr Bernatowicz is sympathetic to the government\u2019s views and has pledged to minimise the influence of leftwing artists.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc6f23cbb1293587550a2777f635d1463cd233c7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc6f23cbb1293587550a2777f635d1463cd233c7/0_0_4500_2701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Showing solidarity \u2026 activists protest against an anti-LGBT far-right rally in Warsaw, on 16 August.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Showing solidarity \u2026 activists protest against an anti-LGBT far-right rally in Warsaw, on 16 August.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Omar Marques/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hip-hop and experimental pop artist Bella \u0106wir says there are fewer and fewer spaces where the LGBTQ+ community can feel safe, alleging \u201cincidents of cops coming to queer parties under the false pretence of verifying the number of people due to the pandemic regulations\u201d. At the protests, there have also been \u201cseveral instances of cops harassing people during their custody stay, especially trans women. There\u2019s little to no possibility of them facing any consequences for that.\u201d \u0106wir say they are \u201cdesensitised\u201d to this treatment, having experienced it their whole life.</p> \n<p>Yet recent events in Poland have radicalised them. They wear loud make-up, long wigs and lavish clothes, inspired by the girls who \u201chad nothing to lose\u201d that they saw as a teenager on the MTV reality shows of the 2000s. More recently, they say, \u201cI understood it was never just a \u2018satire\u2019 or simply dressing up in costumes and playing roles.\u201d They say their visibility has helped others who experience hate. \u201cI get feedback from lots of people that what I do helps them get through the day and that they feel less alone, that it gives them the strength to express themselves freely, too.\u201d</p> \n<p>Poland\u2019s wider LGBTQ+ community is similarly bold and defiant, responding to the government\u2019s stance and police brutality against demonstrators in August with solidarity protests across the country, dubbed the Polish Stonewall. \u201cWhat stood out to me is how quickly people could organise and come to show their support,\u201d says \u0141ukasz Warna-Wies\u0142awski, who DJs as Rusa\u0142ka. They recently founded a label, Ta\u0144ce, to release club music inspired by traditional Polish instruments and rooted in contemporary Poland.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b11f834c-156a-423e-b31e-a5bdcb305f24\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w92V3CCIgpc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Avtomat has recorded the label\u2019s inaugural EP, due out this autumn.

The collectives Flauta and Synergia also centre social justice work in their activities, fundraising for charities that provide aid to refugees \u2013 explicitly demonised by the Law and Justice party in its 2015 presidential campaign \u2013 and that act on climate change.

The post-punk feminist band Siksa, comprising poet and singer Alex Freiheit and bassist Buri, recently released their album <a href=\"https://siksa.bandcamp.com/album/zemsta-na-wroga\">Revenge on the Enemy</a>. \u201c[It is] a story about violence against women directly,\u201d says Buri, \u201cbut, unfortunately, it\u2019s the same kind of violence directed on to queers, people of colour, anarchists and so on.\u201d</p> \n<p>Siksa have released a track in support of the LGBTQ+ community accompanied by a video featuring footage of police assaulting protesters, pushing and dragging them on the ground, during the events in August. It\u2019s spliced with images of a battle dance by people in face masks \u2013 not only to protect against Covid-19, but also to preserve their anonymity for safety.</p> \n<p>The group primarily operate in their hometown of Gniezno (population under 70,000). They organise concerts, workshops, film screenings and meetings with authors who talk about equality, feminism and the LGBTQ+ community in what Freiheit calls \u201ca normal way\u201d, aiming to reach every resident \u2013 just one example of the grassroots approach in Poland that could hopefully bring about change. \u201cI want to be a supporter, doing small steps,\u201d says Freiheit. \u201cNo more heroes, no more romanticism, no more monuments. Simple things to the people. To empowerment.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 September 2020 to clarify that only the party cited in the first paragraph was intended to maximise LGBTQ+ inclusivity, not the whole series of which it was part.</p>"

Its chair, Ita Buttrose, also publicly rebutted claims that Aunty\u2019s budget was growing each year, saying the corporation had actually lost $83m over three years as a result of an indexation pause.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/09/abc-seeks-voluntary-redundancies-to-make-up-41m-budget-shortfall\">After the ABC\u2019s 250 job cuts</a> and cuts to services were announced, the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, said at a press conference with Scott Morrison that the ABC\u2019s funding was increasing every year.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>If you look at the numbers in the budget papers, the ABC\u2019s funding is rising,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all laid out in the budget papers.\u201d</p> <p>So why did Anderson have to cancel the 7.45am radio bulletin and lay off 70 journalists in news and dozens of program makers and production folk in TV if there was no cut?</p> <p>RMIT ABC Fact Check has laid out the whole dispute for anyone who wants to understand the figures. Their conclusion is clear: Fletcher\u2019s statement is misleading, largely because he has not taken inflation into account.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ABCFactCheck/status/1283620926278393856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In response to allegations of cuts to the national broadcaster, Communications Minister <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulFletcherMP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@PaulFletcherMP</a> said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABCaustralia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ABCaustralia</a>&#39;s funding is rising every year.<br><br>We found that claim to be misleading.

The Community and Public Sector Union has crunched the numbers and found the total number of proposed jobs being abolished is 191. When you add the total number of new positions management is proposing, 40, the net job loss is 151. A similar scenario happened in 2015 when job losses ended up significantly lower than first announced.</p> <h2>The class of 75</h2> <p>Some Australian journalists have incredible stamina. When the palace letters were released this week, we were reminded that some of the witnesses to history who reported on the dismissal in 1975 are still writing today. They include the political veterans Paul Kelly, Michelle Grattan, Geoff Kitney and Niki Savva. Kitney, who was political correspondent for the now-defunct Perth Daily News, is soon releasing a memoir which contains a chapter on the Whitlam dismissal.</p> <p>Kelly, who was the Australian\u2019s political reporter at the time and is now the paper\u2019s editor-at-large, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jul/15/this-monstrous-attack-palace-letters-castigate-australian-journalists\">described by Sir John Kerr in 1976 as \u201cpro-Labor\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Savva, a reporter for the Oz 45 years ago, told <a href=\"https://www.podcastoneaustralia.com.au/podcasts/the-briefing-podcast/inside-a-locked-down-public-housing-tower\">The Briefing podcast with Tom Tilley and Annika Smethurst</a> that the event remained the thrill of her reporting life.</p> <p>\u201cEverything pales into insignificance to what happened that day \u2013 it had gone on for close to a year and it was just extraordinary,\u201d she said.</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>Elba and Bill Bailey reflect on the lessons we can learn from the past as their 80s-set sitcom, In the Long Run, returns to Sky</p>",
     "body": "<p>\u201cHistory maketh the man,\u201d says Idris Elba. The actor is quoting his late father, a man who he has spent the past two years playing a version of in his 1980s-set Sky sitcom, <a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/title/series/30cdafe7-f083-4a98-90ef-9619aaaeacfb/in-the-long-run\">In the Long Run</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe 80s saw massive explosions in politics and culture \u2013 from Mandela and apartheid to Thatcher \u2013 and it was also when I grew into a teenager and experienced the beginnings of independence,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a sad and revolutionary time, and it felt important to show the younger generations especially where we came from so they can understand what has led to their realities today.\u201d</p> <p>Elba plays Walter, patriarch of the Sierra Leonean Easmon family, who together navigate the prejudices of their largely white community on a council estate in Leyton, east London. In addition, he must deal with the politics of his workplace at a local factory. For Elba, having grown up on an estate in Hackney with his father working in the nearby Ford factory, it is a story that runs closely to his own. And filming in an afro wig, turtlenecks and flares, representing this period feels particularly relevant at the moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eb7aff3cae413e9b6e2143057b3999c18c6bdad0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb7aff3cae413e9b6e2143057b3999c18c6bdad0/0_146_4908_2946/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Easmon family in In the Long Run\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Easmon family in In the Long Run.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky TV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We are speaking in the midst of worldwide Black Lives Matter protests that were sparked by the killing of George Floyd by US police in Minnesota in May. And Elba has witnessed similar events play out time and time again throughout his life. \u201cOver my four decades, I\u2019ve seen how movement and uprising has come from pain: the Brixton riots was one, the Tottenham riots was one, and In the Long Run sits in a decade where there was a lot of movement,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The current protests have not only demanded police reform but have also led to a reconsideration of the depiction of and representation of black people in the media. They have prompted the widespread removal of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/25/jenny-slate-kristen-bell-recasting-black-tv-voice-roles-is-an-afterthought-opportunity\">white actors voicing animated black characters</a> and episodes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/09/little-britain-removed-from-bbc-iplayer-netflix-and-britbox-blackface\">TV shows that have used blackface</a>. In contrast, In the Long Run is something of a rarity, since its cast is mostly made up of black actors. \u201cWhen we started in 2018, the show was a departure from the Afro Caribbean families we had seen depicted in various programs over the years,\u201d says Elba. \u201cNow having an African family at the centre, I hope, means more people can see themselves represented.\u201d</p> <p>The actor also stresses the diversity of his writers\u2019 room, which includes \u201ca lot of diverse talent who were born in the 80s or earlier\u201d, as well as himself recounting anecdotes from his childhood.</p> <p>This emphasis on representation is one that has been picked up by others, most notably the director Steve McQueen, who, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/jun/20/to-see-race-and-class-at-work-in-britain-just-try-a-film-set-steve-mcqueen\">a powerful Guardian opinion piece</a>, called out the British TV and film industry as racist and named Elba\u2019s earlier detective show Luther as one of the few examples of positive diversity on TV. \u201cI agree with Steve\u2019s perspective on diversity,\u201d Elba says. \u201cHis opinion is very important and should be heard. It has been great how much Sky has stepped up to the plate with my show, though. The development of it came quite soon after I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jan/17/idris-elba-black-actors-lack-of-diversity-uk-television\">spoke to parliament about diversity</a> in 2016 and how we need to provide opportunity and diversity of thought to create compelling storytelling. Sky approached me to say they wanted to make stories that echoed that sentiment. They didn\u2019t hesitate to create a show with black leads.\u201d</p> <p>In the Long Run is no gritty slice of drama, though. Instead, it is a family sitcom with gentle storylines, including Walter\u2019s campaign to become factory foreman, his friendship with his estate neighbour Bagpipes (Bill Bailey) and the acclimatisation of his newly arrived relatives to British life; first his brother Valentine (Jimmy Akingbola) in season one and now his mother in the forthcoming third season. The prejudice of Britain 40 years ago is present throughout \u2013 with Valentine\u2019s arrival on the estate greeted by a \u201cfuck off\u201d from a neighbour \u2013 yet the show\u2019s tenor is still largely one of overwhelming optimism and PG-rated humour.</p> <p>For Bailey, the light touch of comedy is often the best means of communicating difficult ideas and experiences. \u201cIf you\u2019re making someone laugh, then you can get things under the radar,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople\u2019s guards go down and then you can plant a seed of an idea or something difficult in their heads. That\u2019s where comedy has a mercurial quality to it \u2013 it gets into places where perhaps a straight debate can\u2019t.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55771c89e5dbd10e6e63cbe5bf28909b0dfc8ff5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55771c89e5dbd10e6e63cbe5bf28909b0dfc8ff5/0_210_7419_4454/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Bailey in In the Long Run\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s been a joy to be let into Idris\u2019s life and to see his own incredible aptitude for comedy\u2019: Bill Bailey as Bagpipes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Downing/Sky UK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The gentle comedy of the show also lends itself to family viewing. \u201cI remember watching shows like [70s interracial sitcom] Love Thy Neighbour with my dad, and while it had some horrendous writing and stereotyping you would never get away with now, it was representative of an earlier time for me watching it in the 80s,\u201d Elba says. \u201cThose shows open a dialogue between generations and that\u2019s what we want to create with In the Long Run \u2013 for it to bring those old family photos to life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis show really feels like an authentic depiction of family life at the time and that\u2019s what first grabbed my attention,\u201d Bailey adds. \u201cIt\u2019s been a joy to be let into Idris\u2019s life and to see his own incredible aptitude for comedy. It\u2019s been amazing to see people like my 16-year-old son, who has grown up in the digital age, really get an insight into another era too.\u201d</p> <p>For all his show\u2019s gazing into the past, Elba believes that culture in all its forms is essential to the identity of Britain today. \u201cOne thing the lockdown has shown is that it\u2019d be a real shame if our country loses the venues that people congregate in, as at this juncture of society now where everyone\u2019s looking towards each other to answer some really difficult questions, culture is the lifeline,\u201d he says. \u201cThe metropolises of the UK are real melting pots of communities and those are fuelled by gatherings. So we need to keep that alive. That\u2019s how we ultimately understand each other.\u201d</p> <p><em>The third series of In the Long Run starts on Sky One on 23 July</em></p>"

     "body": "<p>For numerous bitter days in early August, Belarus went dark. After the rigged <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/commentisfree/2020/aug/17/the-guardian-view-on-belarus-the-perilous-road-to-democracy\">presidential re-election</a> of Alexander Lukashenko, tens of thousands of civilians took to the streets in peaceful protest, where they were met by state-sanctioned violence as the government killed the internet. Haunting stories <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/2020/aug/18/belarusians-seek-justice-for-brutal-beatings-by-riot-police\">continue to emerge</a> of beatings directed by the government.</p> <p>As unrest endures at home, it has coincided with unprecedented sporting success abroad. At the US Open, five Belarusians reached the second round and the former women\u2019s world No 1 Victoria Azarenka defeated the No 5 seed, Aryna Sabalenka, in a grand Belarusian derby.</p> <p>Their success has forced them to answer political questions, and yielded a variety of answers. While one player refused to discuss the topic, the 21-year-old Vera Lapko protested in Minsk. \u201cIt\u2019s not normal when police hit people,\u201d she said. Azarenka, perhaps the most prominent Belarusian athlete, called the situation \u201cheartbreaking\u201d but she kept her opinions to herself, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be put-on and my words be taken to anybody\u2019s agenda, so I\u2019m going to do what I feel like doing without media.\u201d</p> <p>Some athletes have been more vocal. Last week, more than 400 sporting figures signed an open letter declaring the election invalid. During the shutdown, the former rhythmic gymnast Melitina Staniouta\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/melitinastaniouta/\">Instagram feed</a> became an essential chronicle, documenting riot police battering peaceful civilians, security forces dragging men across the streets and women\u2019s faces caked in blood. She feels she must spread the truth.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe if I didn\u2019t care about my country, I\u2019m just gonna close my eyes and try not to hear anything,\u201d Staniouta says in a phone interview. \u201cBut I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t and I won\u2019t. Belarus is a tiny country, not in the European Union, and no one cares. I have travelled a lot and I can\u2019t say that lots of people know it. When I say I\u2019m from Belarus, they say: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s Russia.\u2019 I say: \u2018No, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/belarus\">Belarus</a>.\u2019 That\u2019s why I was thinking I must do it.

Four weeks since the election, marches <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/30/belarus-protesters-defy-crackdown-to-march-through-minsk-lukashenko\">continue</a>. \u201cWe are angry,\u201d she says. \u201cLots of us in every family now have someone who was over there in protests or who was just looking by or sitting on a bench somewhere with his girlfriend or going out occasionally to the shop, and then appeared in a prison truck.\u201d A good friend of Staniouta attended a protest and woke up in hospital battered, barely able to move, with police staring back. \u201cHe was afraid and says: \u2018They probably want to show me as a leader of these protests.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Staniouta speaks bluntly and she does not hesitate to convey her incredulity towards the dangerous figure at the heart of the unrest. \u201cWhen the president said on the state TV channels that all those people who want freedom, clear elections, are prostitutes, sheep, alcoholics \u2013 oh my god, why?\u201d she says. \u201cHow can we love, how can we be open-hearted \u2026 if he is clearly abusing people?\u201d</p> <p>She has never known a world without Lukashenko. He became president in July 1994 when Staniouta was eight months old. Until she retired in 2016, the 26-year-old\u2019s life was a \u201ccage of our goals and medals and world championships\u201d. She departed as one of the best gymnasts of her generation, with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1629dMNGnOs&amp;t=96s\">14 world championship medals</a> and fifth place <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPU5Z9P0qmk\">at the Rio Olympics</a>. She did not have time to think about politics.</p> <p>It was during the 2010 election that she began to question her surroundings. One day a friend returned home traumatised after a peaceful protest. \u201cShe was super-scared. She needed lots of time to come back to her normal life after what she saw and the bruises on her shoulder blades and her back. Maybe that was the first step to: \u2018What is he doing?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Two months ago Staniouta felt the direct consequences of state repression. In June, police arrived at the doors of Symbal.by in Minsk, a souvenir store that sells <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RFERL/status/1276198472983515141\">satirical products</a> mocking Lukashenko\u2019s popularity, and arrested about 20 people stood in a queue. Staniouta registered her outrage on Instagram. \u201cWhere did the laws that protect us go?\u201d <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CB0PMq8FGvK/?utm_source=ig_embed\">she wrote</a>. Her weekly fitness show for the state broadcaster ONT was immediately suspended and she was fired.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/31/an-existential-crisis-belarus-free-theatre-opens-its-doors-on-an-uncertain-future\">Belarus Free theatre's rebel troupes stand up to the Lukashenko regime</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI just could not keep quiet. My words were just about the law and that we are living in a democratic country. If we don\u2019t break the law, we are under protections. Yet if you were standing in a line in a shop, you can be taken in a prison truck.\u201d</p> <p>Before a trip abroad just before the election, Staniouta attended a rally for Sviatlana Tikhanovskaya, who she describes as a \u201csuper-strong woman\u201d. She knows she could also be at risk and Staniouta still has not returned home. \u201cThat\u2019s my fear \u2013 that I come back and they\u2019ll say: \u2018Hey, she used the internet for her international audience and maybe she\u2019s a leader.\u2019 That can probably be, or they can put some drugs in my luggage.\u201d</p> <p>In the end, the only question Staniouta cannot quite answer is about the silence of some colleagues. \u201cI got so many direct messages saying: \u2018Thank you for your words, thank you for your position, but why does the gymnastics world keep quiet?\u2019 I don\u2019t know. Maybe there is some pressure, but for those guys [striking] in factories, there is pressure too. Maybe much more pressure.\u201d</p>"

In response to the police killing of George Floyd and the worldwide Black Lives Matter protests, Confederate monuments and symbols are being removed and reassessed, not least the flag. In June, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/10/nascar-confederate-flag-banned\">Nascar banned Confederate flags from its race meetings</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/30/mississippi-flag-confederate-symbol-remove\">Mississippi</a> became the final US state to remove the Confederate battle emblem from its state flag.

Culture is also undergoing a reappraisal: Amazon\u2019s streaming service is <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/amazon-imdb-tv-removal-dukes-of-hazzard-confederate-flag-1234632843/\">considering removing The Dukes of Hazzard</a> from its catalogue.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d3adefd4532e87bb969dd8c7bc3de4af93dea51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d3adefd4532e87bb969dd8c7bc3de4af93dea51/0_0_3033_2176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Severing ties \u2026 a Nascar race at Talladega, Alabama.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"717\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Severing ties \u2026 a Nascar race at Talladega, Alabama.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Carr/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it\u2019s not over yet. Dispute rages over what the Confederate flag really signifies. With his limitless desire to open another front in the culture wars, President <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/19/donald-trump-confederate-flag-black-lives-matter-fox-news-sunday\">Trump recently asserted it represents \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d</a>, and criticised Nascar. <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/film/news/spike-lee-confederate-statues-black-list-podcast-1234694958/\">Spike Lee</a>, on the other hand, said the flag made him feel \u201cthe same way my Jewish brothers and sisters feel about the swastika\u201d. Having once stood for one, unambiguous thing \u2013 the Confederate army during the American civil war \u2013 the flag has now accumulated a multitude of meanings, many far removed from the original Confederate cause. Popular culture has been central to that process.</p> <p>The responses to Schneider\u2019s question were an overwhelming \u201cNo\u201d, even from commenters claiming to be black and Latino fans. On the face of it, The Dukes of Hazzard was simple, good-natured fun. It barely ever broached matters of race, slavery or the civil war, although the erasure of non-white characters from the landscape made that easier. Sure, their car had a Confederate flag, but the Dukes were just <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67gig0f4HLo\">\u201cgood ol\u2019 boys, never meanin\u2019 no harm\u201d</a>, as the theme tune had it.</p> <p>The Confederate flag as we know it \u2013 13 white stars on a blue cross with a red background \u2013 was designed in 1861 by William Porcher Miles, an avowed pro-slavery secessionist politician. After the civil war, it became the prevailing way to represent the Confederacy, initially in the context of military history and memorials. It began to seep into popular culture in the 1940s, says John Coski, historian at the American Civil War Museum and <a href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674019836\">author of The Confederate Battle Flag</a>. It was adopted by southern fraternities and soldiers from the south used it during the second world war. It entered postwar politics via the pro-segregation Dixiecrats. In the early 1950s, the US developed a \u201cflag fad\u201d and suddenly it was everywhere: on T-shirts, licence plates and mugs. \u201cIt became an icon for an attitude,\u201d says Coski.</p> <p>And that attitude was \u201crebel\u201d. But, rather than military and political rebellion against the north in defence of a racist ideology, the flag came to represent more nebulous forms of rebellion. Lynyrd Skynyrd\u2019s 1974 pro-southern anthem <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/nov/16/3\">Sweet Home Alabama</a> famously featured the flag on its cover, and the band used it liberally in their graphics, merch and stage act, as did such other southern rock acts as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/03/tom-petty-obituary\">Tom Petty</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/28/old-music-allman-brothers-stormy-monday\">Allman Brothers Band</a>. Petty would unfurl the flag on stage during the song Rebels, whose chorus begins: \u201cI was born a rebel down in Dixie.\u201d They all later renounced its use, though not <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4TRvYAyt3k\">Johnny Cash</a>, who sang in front of it on The Muppet Show in 1980.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e4761db70af93df1b5eb7b592086b784f3e00aee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4761db70af93df1b5eb7b592086b784f3e00aee/0_0_1000_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of Primal Scream\u2019s album Give Out But Don\u2019t Give Up \u2013 a cropped 1980 photograph by William Eggleston.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cover of Primal Scream\u2019s album Give Out But Don\u2019t Give Up \u2013 a cropped 1980 photograph by William Eggleston.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Creation Records</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wasn\u2019t just southern bands. Primal Scream put the flag on the cover of their 1994 album <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Give_Out_But_Don%27t_Give_Up\">Give Out But Don\u2019t Give Up</a>, but this was intended to signal their new southern-tinged sound, the album having been recorded in Memphis. The cover was actually a photograph by <a href=\"https://www.phillips.com/detail/william-eggleston/NY040313/14\">William Eggleston</a>, celebrated chronicler of the southern American landscape whose work often incorporates Confederate flags, overtly or covertly. Eggleston\u2019s best known image may be 1973\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/126324/william-eggleston-greenwood-mississippi-american-1973/\">Greenwood, Mississippi</a> , itself used as a cover for Big Star\u2019s 1974 album Radio City. It depicts a bare lightbulb on a garish red ceiling, with white cables forming an X across it, like a subliminal Confederate flag. </p> <p>On screen, the flag came to represent another form of rebellion, that of the outlaw. It had often figured in movies in a historical context, as in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/13/gone-with-the-wind-hollywood-racism\">Gone With the Win</a>d, but a new trail was blazed by car-chase caper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2018/sep/06/burt-reynolds-a-life-in-pictures#img-9\">Smokey and the Bandit</a>, the US\u2019s highest-grossing movie of 1977 after Star Wars. It features many elements The Dukes of Hazzard would later adapt: a charming southern maverick (Burt Reynolds) evading inept cops in a fast car, with a Confederate flag on its licence plate.</p> <p>In both cases, the flag is associated with mild rebellion against the local law, more on the level of moonshine-running, in a virtually post-racial south. Consciously or not, pop culture was now in step with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy\">the \u201clost cause\u201d narrative</a>, which had striven to dissociate the Confederacy from slavery and racism, aligning it instead with nobility and heroism.</p> <p>The reality was quite different. For one thing, General Lee wasn\u2019t some good soldier who happened to be on the losing side. \u201cWhen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/18/statues-row-is-casting-robert-e-lee-as-the-villain\">Robert E Lee</a>\u2019s army marched into Pennsylvania in the summer of 1863,\u201d says <a href=\"http://cwmemory.com/\">historian Kevin Levin</a>, \u201cit was with the intent of kidnapping upwards of 200 free blacks. That army was carrying the Confederate battle flag. That army was a slave-catching army. It was functioning as the military arm of a government that had one purpose: to protect the institution of slavery.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bebefb2a0385ec1287eab381bfd173a6294c43a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bebefb2a0385ec1287eab381bfd173a6294c43a/0_0_1925_2048/940.jpg\" alt=\"Darker uses \u2026 Ku Klux Klan leaders wave flags at a rally in Cleveland, Ohio.\" width=\"940\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darker form of rebellion \u2026 Ku Klux Klan leaders wave flags at a rally in Cleveland, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Maxwell/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To African Americans especially, the Confederate flag represents a darker form of rebellion, one that targets their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/civil-rights-movement\">civil rights</a>.

Even in 1982, when The Dukes of Hazzard was at its peak, John Hawkins, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/04/us/black-cheerleader-balks-at-waving-the-rebel-flag.html\">first black cheerleader</a> at the University of Mississippi, ignited a controversy by refusing to bear the flag at college football games, where it was a ubiquitous fixture. His fraternity was picketed by over 1,000 white students waving Confederate flags. The local Ku Klux Klan held a protest.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What is the idea that this symbol is intended to convey?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhat is the idea that this symbol is intended to convey?\u201d says Kyle Bowser, consultant to the Hollywood bureau of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/13/spike-in-us-hate-crimes-warrants-congressional-action-says-naacp\">NAACP</a>). \u201cThe common denominators seem to be elements that are malicious, unproductive and certainly injurious to certain members of our society.\u201d In 2000, the NAACP and other groups began an economic boycott of South Carolina over its refusal to remove the Confederate flag from the state capitol, where it had flown since 1962.</p> <p>Ironically, around the same time, the flag began to be appropriated by black musicians, who sought to redefine its meaning. Such rappers as Outkast\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYxAiK6VnXw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=15\">Andr\u00e9 3000</a>, <a href=\"https://www.allmusic.com/album/put-yo-hood-up-mw0000587674\">Lil Jon</a> and Ludacris all wore the symbol. Ludacris caused a stir at the 2005 Vibe awards by performing draped head to toe in a Confederate flag outfit. After the show, he said: \u201cThis flag represents the oppression that we as African Americans have endured for years. This is a symbol of segregation and racism. At the end of the performance, I removed and stomped on the flag to reveal my version of the flag \u2013 a flag comprised of black, red and green.

The 21-year-old shooter, Dylann Roof, was avowedly motivated by white supremacist beliefs, and his website featured images of himself waving the Confederate flag. Within weeks, major retailers \u2013 including Wal-Mart, Amazon, Sears and eBay \u2013 pledged to stop selling Confederate flag merchandise. The manufacture of toy replicas of the General Lee also ceased. And, in a victory for the NAACP, the <a href=\"http://www.naacp.org/latest/naacp-applauds-south-carolina-state-legislature-for-voting-to-remove-confed/\">flag was removed from the South Carolina state capitol</a>.

According to a <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/images/polling/us/us07152020_ulvz33.pdf\">Quinnipiac poll</a> this month, 56% of Americans see the Confederate flag as a symbol of racism. In another poll, however, <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2020/06/10/confederate-statue-flag-polling/\">70% of Republicans</a> saw the flag as \u201ca symbol of southern pride\u201d. Even as the military and Nascar abandon the flag, other southern groups are resisting the erasure, encouraged by Donald Trump. On 15 July, some 4,500 <a href=\"https://thepoliticalinsider.com/more-than-4500-supporters-spread-over-an-8-mile-convoy-rally-for-the-confederate-flag/\">\u201cpatriots\u201d drove in an eight-mile convoy</a> through Ocala, Florida, in support of the flag which, of course, appeared in abundance.

The NAACP\u2019s Kyle Bowser responds: \u201cI would press those who feel that connection to clearly articulate that heritage. Is it the food they ate? Is it a style of dress or art?

The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/10/united-daughters-of-the-confederacy-statues-lawsuit\">United Daughters of the Confederacy</a> were responsible for airbrushing Confederate history and erecting monuments to the civil war in the 20th century. In the 1940s and 50s, they campaigned to pass laws restricting the use of the flag solely to historical and commemorative purposes.</p> <p>\u201cWhy make a point of trying to keep it out there,\u201d says Coski, \u201cwhere everyone has a right to interpret it however they wish? Isn\u2019t it in your interest to limit it to museums, where it has an unambiguous historical context, or to cemeteries where it has an unambiguous memorial context?\u201d</p> <p>Should we also put The Dukes of Hazzard in a museum? Should we remove it from our screens, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/19/song-of-the-south-the-difficult-legacy-of-disneys-most-shocking-movie\">like Disney did with Song of the South</a> (having accepted that the film\u2019s cheery nostalgia for slavery and plantation life was grossly offensive); or provide historical context, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/25/gone-with-the-wind-returns-to-hbo-max-with-disclaimer-that-film-denies-the-horrors-of-slavery\">HBO Max recently did with Gone With the Wind</a>? These are tricky questions. But, while the \u201cculture war\u201d grinds on, no creator of film, television, music or art is likely to use the Confederate flag unthinkingly ever again \u2013 and most will choose not to use it at all.</p> <p>As with the Confederacy itself, the fight to retain the flag in US public life is facing defeat. The only thing it now seems to symbolise is America\u2019s inability to heal its divisions and reconcile with its past.</p>"

     "body": "<p>Campaigners are calling for the redesign of one of Britain\u2019s highest honours personally bestowed by the Queen because they say its badge resembles a depiction of a white angel standing on the neck of a chained black man.</p> <p>The Order of St Michael and St George is traditionally awarded to ambassadors and diplomats and senior Foreign Office officials who have served abroad. It has three ranks, the highest of which is Knight Grand Cross (GCMG), followed by Knight Commander (KCMG) and Companion (CMG).</p> <p>The imagery on the award\u2019s badge portrays St Michael trampling on Satan, but campaigners say the image is reminiscent of the killing of George Floyd by white police officers in the US that led to worldwide protests.</p> <p>A petition calling for the medal to be redesigned has attracted more than 2,000 signatures on <a href=\"http://change.org/\">change.org</a>. The petition, started by Tracy Reeve, says: \u201cThis is a highly offensive image, it is also reminiscent of the recent murder of George Floyd by the white policeman in the same manner presented here in this medal. We the undersigned are calling for this medal to completely redesigned in a more appropriate way and for an official apology to be given for the offence it has given.\u201d</p> <p>Bumi Thomas, a Nigerian British singer, activist and specialist in visual communications, said the imagery on the badge was clear. \u201cIt is not a demon; it is a black man in chains with a white, blue-eyed figure standing on his neck. It is literally what happened to George Floyd and what has been happening to black people for centuries under the guise of diplomatic missions: active, subliminal messaging that reinforces the conquest, subjugation and dehumanisation of people of colour.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a depiction on a supposed honour of the subjugation of the black and brown people of the world and the superiority of the white, a construct born in the 16th century. It is the definition of institutional racism that this image is not only permitted but celebrated on one of the country\u2019s highest honours. Whilst statues are being pulled down and relocated, emblems and symbols of this nature also need to be redesigned to reflect a more progressive, holistic relationship between Britain and the Commonwealth nations.\u201d</p> <p>Sir Simon Woolley, the director and one of the founders of Operation Black Vote, which campaigns for greater representation of ethnic minorities in politics and public life, said he was appalled by the badge.</p> <p>\u201cThe original image may have been of St Michael slaying Satan, but the figure has no horns or tail and is clearly a black man. It is a shocking depiction, and it is even more shocking that that image could be presented to ambassadors representing this country abroad,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThis is the past that informs the present, and that\u2019s why it symbolises everything that Black Lives Matter are campaigning for. It provides a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge is to acknowledge it and own it, but the opportunity is to put it right. It is easy to get rid of an image, but I would like root-and-branch restructuring, because most of the institutions created by the empire are still there.</p> <p>\u201cFor most black and brown people, there is nothing good about the empire. Most people will see this as an image of George Floyd on a global scale and a symbol of white supremacy.\u201d</p> <p>The Order was founded in 1818 under King George III. It was originally created to honour service in the Mediterranean during the Napoleonic wars. The motto that surrounds the image is <em>Auspicium melioris \u00e6vi,</em> Latin for \u201cOmen of a better age\u201d.</p> <p>Buckingham Palace has been approached for comment.</p>"

Now, they face an additional challenge of conducting an election that guarantees people can vote without risking their physical safety and without police intimidation as curfews clash with voting hours. </p> <p>One of the most closely watched states on Tuesday is Pennsylvania, a battleground state, where lawmakers are already seeing an unprecedented flood of requests for mail-in ballots. More than 1.8 million people have requested an absentee ballot so far; during the 2016 primary, just 84,000 people voted by mail.&nbsp;But some voters are still expected to cast a ballot in person, as well.</p> <p>Pennsylvania law requires voters to return their mail-in ballots to the polls by 8pm on election day. But on Monday evening Pennsylvania\u2019s governor, Tom Wolf, a Democrat, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-mail-ballot-deadline-extension-executive-order-20200601.html\">extended the deadline</a> for voters in six counties in the state to return their ballots, saying they could be counted if they were received in the next week and postmarked by Tuesday.</p> <p>That came after concern that some voters in the state might be disenfranchised because officials could not get them ballots in time. In Delaware county, just outside Philadelphia, elections officials <a href=\"https://www.delcopa.gov/publicrelations/releases/2020/primaryupdate_june1.html\">said Monday</a> they were mailing 6,000 ballots, the day before the election. The county conceded there were 400 ballots that won\u2019t be mailed \u201cdue to timing and staffing constraints\u201d.</p> <p>In Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, election officials have severely limited in-person voting locations because of the coronavirus pandemic. In Philadelphia, officials are monitoring whether they will have to change any of those few locations because of the recent protests, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/george-floyd-protests-philadelphia-pa-primary-election-20200601.html\">according to the Philadelphia Inquirer</a>. At at least one voting location in Philadelphia, there were long lines on Tuesday morning as poll workers set up voting machines.</p> <p>Voting rights groups monitoring the elections throughout the country said they were fielding calls from voters reporting problems. In many states, voters reported not receiving mail-in ballot requests in time to vote.</p> <p>By Tuesday afternoon, about 500 people in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a> had called in to an election protection hotline run by the groups, about half of the voters were seeking information about their polling location, Suzanne Almeida, the interim executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania, a watchdog group, told reporters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Elaijuh/status/1267785942393401351\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Lee Griffith, 35, is furious.

In Washington DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser <a href=\"https://wtop.com/dc/2020/06/sad-and-angry-after-destruction-mayhem-in-dc-during-protests/\">announced a 7pm</a> curfew for Tuesday, but polls will be open until 8pm.

The fashion industry\u2019s reaction to these events has seen big players \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jun/13/anna-wintour-vogue-diversity-racism-debate\">Anna Wintour</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBLEmAsjzx7/\">the British Fashion Council</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CA3idS8naJq/\">Jonathan Anderson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBJ1RFAnthN/\">Reformation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CA2-gkdMfDf/\">Sarah Mower</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CA_tt5pnm53/\">Carine Roitfield</a>, to name just a few \u2013 issuing apologies, and brands such as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBQO_OKAgCK\">All Saints</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CA6M9hDAYbU/\">Burberry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CA38I0KDwsD/\">Calvin Klein</a> making vague proclamations of solidarity. Well intended as those social media epiphanies may have been, it struck me that they evaded the most pressing causes of institutionalised racism within fashion: access and equity.</p> <p>Undoubtedly, it is not inclusivity, but exclusivity that drives fashion, from the <a href=\"https://www.voguebusiness.com/fashion/fashion-show-front-row-fashion-week-diversity-inclusion-influencers\">VIP culture of the front row</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.thenationalstudent.com/fashion_and_beauty/2019-01-22/does_the_fashion_industry_have_a_nepotism_problem.html\">nepotism</a> and lack of transparency surrounding recruitment for the most elusive roles and opportunities. Endorsement by the British Fashion Council is commodified through the extortionate fees charged to designers for listing on the official London fashion week schedule. Entry-level, emerging designers who pay \u00a3500 a year for a <a href=\"https://www.britishfashioncouncil.co.uk/BFC-Membership\">British Fashion Council membership</a> pay \u00a3630 to be listed, while non-members pay \u00a31,000 a season. The tiered pricing structure for event listings \u2013 in which costs rise as high as \u00a33,000 a season \u2013 do not take into consideration the additional costs of the catwalk shows and presentations, or a designer\u2019s production costs for the clothing collections. Such expense excludes many from the vital opportunity to be seen by essential press, buyers and industry professionals. While in many cases they are now illegal, fashion\u2019s continuing culture of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/feb/08/vogue-criticised-for-unpaid-internships\">unpaid internships</a> allows those with financial ability and adequate networks to get ahead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89dd05f4d81bbf41139bbd3d941642c8d7489cd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89dd05f4d81bbf41139bbd3d941642c8d7489cd0/0_0_2480_3720/667.jpg\" alt=\"Tolu Coker, autumn/winter 2019.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tolu Coker, autumn/winter 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Armstrong</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Traditional industry career advice often describes the world of fashion as a meritocracy, with hopefuls urged to get the right education, then explore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2014/jun/25/interview-caroline-rush-british-fashion-council\">\u201cevery opportunity</a>\u201d and be a \u201crelentless worker\u201d.

Social Class, Taste and Inequalities in the Creative Industries</a> debunk the myth of meritocracy. The authors write that what is particularly worrying is that: \u201cThose people who are in the best position to effect change are the very people who most strongly support the meritocratic explanation.\u201d</p> <p>As a fashion designer, business owner, former Central Saint Martins graduate and current university lecturer, I have witnessed processes rigged with racial and social inequities, across educational and professional sectors. But it is not only my own experiences \u2013 or those I have witnessed among black peers \u2013 that inform my approach to fashion\u2019s systemic racism. As an academic, it is my access to data.</p> <p>It is data that unquestionably shows that black people are underrepresented in the very industries which claim to want to make space for them. Creative industries are <a href=\"https://createlondon.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Panic-Social-Class-Taste-and-Inequalities-in-the-Creative-Industries1.pdf\">not diverse in terms of ethnicity</a>, with particularly low numbers of black and minority ethnic workers across museums, galleries and libraries (2.7%); film, TV, video, radio and photography (4.2%); and music, performing and visual arts (4.8%).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2257802fa945df1e01cfc2a68d7840dd9a871f8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2257802fa945df1e01cfc2a68d7840dd9a871f8b/0_0_1208_805/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tolu Coker, autumn/winter 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tolu Coker, autumn/winter 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura De Meo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>UK government statistics show that the black ethnic group generally has the <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/work-pay-and-benefits/employment/employment-by-occupation/latest\">lowest percentage of workers</a> (5%) in \u201cmanager, director or senior official\u201d jobs, while occupying the largest percentage (16%) within \u201celementary\u201d jobs \u2013 the lowest skilled type of occupation. Where access to education is concerned, the data is even more telling. Higher education organisations often seem impressive on the surface \u2013 University of the Arts London\u2019s 2018 <a href=\"https://www.arts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0021/89211/UAL-Equality-Diversity-Inclusion-Report-2018.pdf\">Diversity and Inclusion report</a>, for example, lists the student population as 47% black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) and 53% white students. Yet when offered with the context that 87% of these BAME students are international students of Asian background, most of whom pay extortionate fees,<strong> </strong>this framework warps the integrity and effectiveness of any BAME-targeted approaches at ensuring equitable access to all minority groups.</p> <p>When data is broken down by ethnicity, a very different picture emerges among UK-resident graduates. Indian, Chinese and \u201dother Asian\u201d graduates, who all fall within the BAME category, have the <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/education-skills-and-training/after-education/destinations-and-earnings-of-graduates-after-higher-education/latest\">highest average earnings one year after graduation</a>, out-earning even their white counterparts. Black Caribbean, black other and Bangladeshi students have the lowest average earnings within one year of graduation.</p> <p>As a means of understanding and assessing racism across fashion and the creative industries, the BAME framework is fundamentally flawed. Not only does the term distinguish little difference between non-white communities, it insidiously serves as a way of collectively \u201cothering\u201d communities that fall outside the parameters of whiteness. The impact of this exceeds semantics: it assumes as a prerequisite that the same issues to the same extents subjugate across different minority-ethnic groups. Data analysed through BAME therefore often presents favourable, yet skewed, narratives of inclusion for corporations that conveniently exploit diversity and inclusion as a marketing and box-ticking tool.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25e6c15048e7e7a9d180e8d06e4a29ac5e76ada2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25e6c15048e7e7a9d180e8d06e4a29ac5e76ada2/0_0_2480_3720/667.jpg\" alt=\"Tolu Coker, autumn/winter 2019.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tolu Coker, autumn/winter 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Armstrong</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The recent performative disassociation from fashion\u2019s elitist practices, by many of its gatekeepers during the Black Lives Matter protests, suggests further misunderstanding about systemic racism in fashion. No one can self-proclaim allyship or sympathise their way out of systemic racism. In my view, a clear start and call to action is for fashion to adopt ethnicity-specific frameworks that allow different communities the dignity of difference and offer clear metrics for appraisal. Armed with adequate data, the bottom line is that equitable inclusion must be mandated through government policy \u2013 we cannot rely merely on sentiment and the moral compass of individuals to invoke and sustain anti-racism.</p>"

He said Asio\u2019s overarching legislation prevented the agency from limiting the right of a person to engage in lawful advocacy, protest or dissent.</p> <p>\u201cWe generally don\u2019t look at protests, but if we have intelligence or information that says someone is wanting to encourage people to protest \u2026 if they have intent to promote acts of violence and unlawful harm at the higher end then that\u2019s where we do get involved.\u201d</p> <p>Heather Cook, a deputy director general who appeared alongside Burgess at the inquiry hearing, elaborated on the types of protests that may attract Asio\u2019s attention.</p> <p>She cited the example of \u201can issue-motivated group which organises itself around committing acts of violence or destruction\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSo if I were to think perhaps a little bit more historically, some of the anarchist groups or anti-globalisation groups \u2026 where it wasn\u2019t simply opportunistic; they planned, they organised, they developed capability around undertaking acts of violence to support their particular issue \u2013 that would be somewhere where we would concern ourselves, but not the opportunistic scuffling that occurs between protest groups, or stickering or postering or graffitiing,\u201d Cook said.</p> <p>\u201cThose would be police matters if they met those thresholds.\u201d</p> <p>Cook also indicated the previous restriction of the questioning power to terrorism offences had prevented use of that measure in recent years to quiz a \u201cvery significant number of individuals who were seeking to travel overseas\u201d to join groups fighting in foreign conflicts.</p> <p>\u201cEqually when those individuals come back, if there\u2019s not a link to a terrorism offence under Australian law, but we would wish to question them on their activities while overseas, and their contacts and associates, we would not be able to use a questioning warrant to do that under the current narrow definition,\u201d Cook said.</p> <p>Pauline Wright, the president of the Law Council of Australia, told the inquiry \u201cthat Australia is the only country in the Five Eyes alliance to confer a compulsory questioning power on one of its intelligence agencies for the purpose of collecting security intelligence, so there is a need to carefully scrutinise any proposal to expand those powers\u201d.</p> <p>Dr David Neal SC, also from the Law Council, said the definition of foreign interference \u2013 also covered by the expanded questioning power \u2013 included activities \u201cotherwise detrimental to the interests of Australia\u201d. He suggested anyone who may have relevant information about this could be questioned \u2013 potentially including journalists, academics, business operators and lawyers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/04/the-case-against-dan-oakes-exposes-how-dangerously-fragile-press-freedom-is-in-australia\">The case against Dan Oakes exposes how dangerously fragile press freedom is in Australia | Peter Greste</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Neal said China\u2019s national security legislation in relation to Hong Kong \u201cconfines itself not to things which are detrimental to the interests of China but confines itself to secession from China, or standard sorts of things about sedition\u201d.</p> <p>He said the breadth of what was covered by the proposed Australian law \u201creally is extreme\u201d. However, Neal added \u201ca couple of words of caution\u201d regarding the comparison, including that what was written into the text of the Hong Kong legislation may not mirror the realities of how it would be implemented.</p> <p>Burgess, appearing at the committee later in the day, said he was offended by the \u201cridiculous\u201d comparison with the Hong Kong law, which would reportedly allow people who damaged public transport to be charged with terrorism and jailed for life.</p> <p>Drawing such parallels was offensive \u201cto the men and women of my organisation, some of whom put their lives on the line to protect Australians from serious security threats\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cTo suggest that these bills are comparable, and in fact our bill is worse, is just beyond the pale,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely, completely wrong.\u201d</p> <p>The inspector general of intelligence and security, Margaret Stone, said the plan to shift the role of approving questioning warrants to the attorney general \u201cdeparts from the trend towards increased requirements for external authorisation in other Five Eyes jurisdictions\u201d.</p>"

At his barbecue stand, McAtee was busy shuffling between the grills made out of oil drums that he cooked on and the kitchen. He <a href=\"https://www.leoweekly.com/2020/06/west-ninth-%E2%80%A8david-mcatee-words/\">had hoped</a> to open a bricks-and-mortar restaurant one day.</p> \n<p>None of them had the faintest idea that McAtee\u2019s name would soon join the long list of those chanted by protesters across the US calling for an end to police violence against people of color.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was just a normal day. People just having fun. Not nobody was about trouble,\u201d McAtee\u2019s nephew, Marvin McAtee, told the Guardian as he stood next to the bullet-pocked wall beside the kitchen entrance. \u201cNothing that serious for the marshals to come over for us.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"64456e4c54b1140b51769f0e1b3964675807f1c8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64456e4c54b1140b51769f0e1b3964675807f1c8/0_6_4950_2971/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dwayne Simmons makes a memorial to David McAtee near the intersection of 26th and Broadway in Louisville, Kentucky, on 2 June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dwayne Simmons makes a memorial to David McAtee near the intersection of 26th and Broadway in Louisville, Kentucky, on 2 June.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darron Cummings/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was just after midnight on 1 June when at least two trucks of national guard troops and a number of Louisville metro police department (LMPD) officers arrived at the intersection with the goal of breaking up the crowd that was gathered there in violation of curfew. Protesters downtown had already been dispersed earlier with teargas, pepper balls and baton rounds. Now they were trying to put the city to bed.</p> \n<p>In surveillance footage released by LMPD, officers can be seen shooting pepper balls in the direction the people gathered next to the grills at YaYa\u2019s BBQ. The crowd appears to panic and flees into the kitchen, where McAtee had gone just before the arrival of the police and troops. He pushes through the crowd to get to the door to see what is going on, his right hand on his hip where he appears to be <a href=\"https://wfpl.org/in-david-mcatee-video-new-evidence-and-new-questions/\">wearing a pistol</a>. He takes a step outside the door and raises his arm in the air \u2013 a motion consistent with firing a warning shot \u2013 before rushing back inside and collapsing on the ground.</p> \n<p>\u201cA curfew? You come and shoot at people for a curfew? I cannot stand it,\u201d said Marvin McAtee, who worked with his uncle cooking barbecue. \u201cI have no hate for the police or nothing.

The surveillance footage does not show McAtee firing a weapon. There is no body-cam footage of the incident despite requirements for LMPD officers to wear and activate the devices.</p> \n<p>Marvin McAtee says his uncle would not fire at police and was defending his shop in a chaotic situation. He did not see his uncle fire a shot. Amid the unrest across the US in recent days, business owners have taken to carrying weapons and firing shots in the air to dissuade looters.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>McAtee\u2019s killing prompted quick and sweeping changes: Louisville\u2019s mayor, Greg Fischer fired the police chief and police have, in the days since, taken a markedly less aggressive stance on protesters after the force had faced accusations of heavy-handedness and teargassing peaceful demonstrators. On Thursday, the curfew ended.</p> \n<p>But McAtee\u2019s death bore a striking resemblance to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">killing of Taylor</a>, raising questions over whether meaningful reform was indeed under way.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor shooting: hunt for answers in case of black woman killed by police</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Taylor was shot and killed by plainclothes LMPD officers serving a no-knock warrant in a narcotics investigation in March.

Like today, the nationwide unrest was compounded in Louisville by local incidents: weeks before the assassination, a local black man had been beaten by a Louisville cop, driving even more anger. Segregation in the city was exacerbated by the unrest as white residents left the western part of the city. The city remains heavily segregated today.</p> \n<p>In more recent times, Louisville was \u201calmost the Ferguson, Missouri story before Ferguson, Missouri\u201d in 2004 according to Christopher 2X, an anti-violence activist who runs the organization&nbsp;<a href=\"https://2xgamechangers.org/\">Game Changers</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In January of that year, 19-year-old Mike Newby was shot and killed by undercover cop named McKenzie Mattingly during an attempted drug buy sting. Mattingly said he had feared for his life, but Newby was shot three times in the back. The killing stoked protests in Louisville. Mattingly was charged with murder, but acquitted.</p> \n<p>This time, Deonte Hollowell, a professor at Louisville\u2019s Spalding University who studies the relationship between African American communities and the police, says he\u2019s hopeful that the protest movement will lead to change.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s possible because I think there\u2019s so many people that are passionate about not just getting justice for YaYa and Breonna, but changing the system,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>But, he added, there\u2019s a lot of work to be done before anger on the street will lessen.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I don\u2019t think at this point the anger is going anywhere until those officers are arrested</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Deonte Hollowell</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think at this point the anger is going anywhere until those officers are arrested,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd even then, there\u2019s so many other layers to this that that would be a satisfactory situation, but it wouldn\u2019t be the end by any means. And I think that most people, or many people, that are protesting understand that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Residents of the western part of Louisville, where McAtee was killed, often consider the area ignored by the city. It\u2019s a part of town where <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/redlining-what-is-history-mike-bloomberg-comments/\">the inequality and damage done by redlining</a> is apparent.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t been funded in the West End for a long time. Not since the 1968 riot,\u201d said Ruby Johnson, 38, as she volunteered handing out donated food to the community in front of a boarded-up Kroger supermarket a block from YaYa\u2019s BBQ that had been looted in the aftermath of McAtee\u2019s death. \u201cEver since then they pulled out and they ain\u2019t ever been back. And that\u2019s the truth. I been down here my whole life.\u201d</p> \n<p>As she spoke, she pointed out abandoned buildings, mentioning the businesses that once occupied them but have disappeared. On the street where she owns a nursery, over a third of the homes are abandoned.</p> \n<p>Cherrie Vaughn, 42, was nearby at the shuttered Kroger gas station where she had been leading prayer groups following McAtee\u2019s death. She said she had faith that the upheavals being witnessed in Louisville and around the country would lead to lasting change \u2013 not only as far as the relationship between African American communities and police, but as far as equity and opportunity.</p> \n<p>\u201cI feel like right now the world is at a turning point,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying it for so long, we\u2019ve been saying it for so long, we\u2019ve been saying it for so long and now we\u2019re at this brick wall and it has to come down.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0617b81f-5431-457d-b963-3e057fc1b578\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gfIWyPgE_E0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>"

Lawrence Booth, the Wisden editor, echoes Holding\u2019s view at the time, when the Sky commentator and former West Indies fast bowler spoke of \u201clame excuses\u201d.</p> <p>Booth writes: \u201cFor a while, cricket said and did the right things. The ECB admitted they had let things slip, and promised action. But cricket isn\u2019t fond of radicalism (unless there is money to be made). Predictably, it lost its nerve. By the time Pakistan arrived, taking a knee had been quietly dropped, amid supposed concerns about the politicisation of BLM.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the Australians touched down, both they and England made noises about placing education above protest, as if they couldn\u2019t coexist. From two countries with mainly white teams and a dubious history of race relations, the optics were terrible.</p> <p>\u201cCricket has been here before: a sympathetic ear, a pat on the shoulder, a promise that things will change. They never do, but this time they must. By not taking a knee, cricket raised a finger.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere, in a relatively slimline edition (albeit still 1,248 pages, down from 1,536 last year), Wisden explores diversity in cricket with an essay by Rainford-Brent, remembers those in the sport lost to Covid-19 and credits the England and Wales Cricket Board for a swift response to the pandemic that still allowed international cricket to be staged \u2013 even if the inequality of the global game was later exposed by a raft of cancellations.</p> <p>As a golden oldie itself, Wisden also names Darren Stevens among its five cricketers of the year. Aged 44 years and 350 days at the time of Thursday\u2019s publication, and having taken 29 Bob Willis Trophy wickets at 15 apiece, the Kent all-rounder is the fifth oldest recipient and the most senior since Ewart Astill (45 years and 45 days) in 1933.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin\">  <iframe id=\"the-spin\" name=\"the-spin\" src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-spin\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe\" height=\"52px\" frameborder=\"0\" data-component=\"email-embed--the-spin\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Along with Holder and Stevens, Zak Crawley and Dom Sibley also receive this once-in-a-career award \u2013 the former for his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/22/zak-crawleys-huge-double-century-lifts-england-and-floors-pakistan\">267 at the Rose Bowl</a>, the latter for providing \u201cthe glue England needed at the top of their Test order\u201d \u2013 as does Mohammad Rizwan, an \u201celectric presence behind the stumps\u201d during Pakistan\u2019s 1-0 series defeat.</p> <p>Ben Stokes is named Wisden\u2019s leading cricketer in the world for the second year running, his 641 Test runs at 58 the most during the 12-month period, with Australia\u2019s Beth Mooney awarded the women\u2019s equivalent after starring in the T20 World Cup.

But the washing of hands was performed by an unnamed defence official. Neither Esper nor Milley renounced their actions on camera.&nbsp;</p> <p>It is not just the public officials. The constitutional constraints have also shown themselves more elastic than previously thought.

     "body": "<p>South London quartet Goat Girl were deep into making their second album when it became clear that something was very wrong with their youngest member, guitarist-vocalist Ellie Rose Davies. At the end of 2019, she had had lumps on her neck for some time, which eventually spread to both armpits. It wasn\u2019t until the 23-year-old\u2019s \u201cfourth or fifth\u201d trip to the doctors that she was finally referred for a blood test, then a biopsy. \u201cBy which time the cancer was at stage four,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Davies had Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer of the blood, and had to start a six-month course of chemotherapy immediately. \u201cWe were pretty worried because we knew it was getting worse,\u201d says their bassist, Holly Mullineaux. They had been mixing the record with their producer, Dan Carey, when Davies got her results, \u201cand we all just started crying\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a really shocking moment,\u201d says lead singer-guitarist Lottie Pendlebury. \u201cA lot of silence. A lot of hugging.\u201d</p> <p>Then came the pandemic. Davies decamped with her family to Cornwall, where the risk of Covid was lower, and underwent treatment. She is in remission now, although the experience is clearly painful to talk about. \u201cThe thought that death was knocking at the door was very real for me, and that still hasn\u2019t gone away,\u201d she says.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvUSwTO0j0k\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nvUSwTO0j0k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve always felt we're anti-racist and we strive to create change; we\u2019re all trying our best but it\u2019s not really enough</p> <footer> <cite>Lottie Pendlebury</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When Goat Girl were signed to Rough Trade in 2016, they were still teenagers, and lived and breathed the DIY spirit. They had been playing together since school, came up around the same time as other rabble-rousers who populated Brixton\u2019s Windmill venue such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jan/16/shame-there-are-moments-where-you-think-youre-superhuman\">Shame</a> and Black Midi, and rehearsed in Davies\u2019 mum\u2019s garage. Their music, spanning swampy psych-rock, grotbag grunge and unkempt post-punk, spoke to the angst and uncertainty of being young. But Davies\u2019 diagnosis, coupled with the political joyride of the past year \u2013 from Black Lives Matter to Brexit \u2013 was a wake-up call.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like [we\u2019re] a different band. I\u2019m a different person, for sure,\u201d says Pendlebury, still in bed in her pyjamas, and hungover from her 24th birthday last night. She and the drummer, Rosy Jones, who is absent from today\u2019s Zoom call, live in a Lewisham terrace strewn with homemade banners calling for \u201ctrans rights now\u201d and to \u201cend the hostile environment\u201d. They have always been outspoken on issues they care about, they say, but the protests that followed the death of George Floyd were a particular cause for reflection.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my duty to educate myself further on these things and understand my privileges,\u201d says Pendlebury. \u201cWe\u2019ve always felt we are anti-racist and we strive to create some kind of change in society; obviously we\u2019re all trying our best, but it\u2019s not really enough.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s plenty of anti-authoritarian attitude in On All Fours, the follow-up to their acclaimed 2018 self-titled debut. The new album title conjures an image of Maggie Gyllenhaal in the film Secretary: complete submission, letter in mouth. The band partly liked that it felt a bit \u201canimalistic\u201d but also evoked a power struggle; it considers climate change, the egocentrism of the western world, and mental health, often with unwavering specificity. The new song P.T.S.Tea is about a ferry trip, when Jones, who is non-binary, was burned with boiling hot tea by someone who did not apologise. \u201cThat can be broadened out into a more general feeling of: \u2018Why am I not being listened to, why isn\u2019t my identity respected?\u2019\u201d says Pendlebury.</p> <p>Or there is They Bite on You, which must be the first ever song about scabies and uses Pendlebury\u2019s experience of losing her mind to mites as a metaphor for \u201ccapitalist parasites\u201d. Her lyrics are not prescriptive, but try to channel the band\u2019s \u201cfeelings of helplessness in a positive way, rather than being complacent \u2026 Whatever I\u2019m writing is always gonna be inspired by politics in some way, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever that explicit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45ae53414e4975c7a41e4f8147850d6e029e8de5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45ae53414e4975c7a41e4f8147850d6e029e8de5/289_286_3414_2049/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lottie Goat Girl\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kid rock \u2026 Lottie Pendlebury and friend on stage at Glastonbury 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For all their obvious brilliance, you do get the sense that Goat Girl are sometimes not taken as seriously as their male post-punk peers, such as the Irish band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/fontaines-dc\">Fontaines DC</a>, who have been nominated for a Grammy. \u201cWe\u2019re pissed off,\u201d says Davies, although it\u2019s impossible to tell if she\u2019s joking or not. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m happy for them. But we\u2019ve been going for longer. There do need to be more female artists being pushed for this kind of stuff.\u201d</p> <p>They share the barbed ferocity of Fat White Family, they say. \u201cRemember when there was an uproar and people said they shouldn\u2019t play Glastonbury because they\u2019d said some controversial political things?\u201d says Mullineaux. \u201cOn our first record, a track like Burn the Stake has a similar sentiment\u201d \u2013 it says to put the Tories on top of a bonfire \u2013 \u201cbut it\u2019s like we\u2019re seen as harmless because we\u2019re not men. It\u2019s not even recognised as being on the same level of intensity.\u201d</p> <p>On All Fours still has the elastic live feel of their early material but Goat Girl are very much upping their game. It is the first album they have written collaboratively, and they have added more electronic elements. The melancholy dance-punk of Sad Cowboy has a synth breakdown that recalls Caribou\u2019s Can\u2019t Do Without You, and there\u2019s a Broadcast-like airiness to songs such as Where Do We Go from Here? and Closing In. Their enormous track The Crack \u2013 \u201cAbout the power of nature and how, when it comes down to a pandemic, or your health, it doesn\u2019t discriminate,\u201d says Pendlebury \u2013 is a song cleaved in two, starting with the clanging thrust of early Franz Ferdinand before it wafts into psychedelic pop.</p> <p>Lockdown gave them time to involve themselves with more of the creative aspects, too, says Mullineaux, such as the artwork and their visual aesthetic. For all their press photographs, they appear in coordinated reds, oranges and yellows; defiant and radiant and ready to take on 2021. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot together,\u201d says Pendlebury. \u201cBeing in this band is what brings us the most joy.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 On All Fours is out on 29 January via Rough Trade</p>"

It has lived through dozens of mass movements, but the events of this year have sparked something different, according to its director, Michael La Rose.</p> <p>\u201cThe consciousness-raising of the global BLM movement has made every country question what is going on in their societies \u2013 people want to know what has happened in the past, to get books, to get information, to get facts,\u201d said La Rose, the son of John La Rose, who founded the business with his partner, Sarah White, in 1966. \u201cThat led to more business on our website and people walking into the bookshop.\u201d</p> <p>Like most retailers, the bookshop has taken a hit this year because of lockdown, and La Rose said a \u201csustained movement\u201d was needed to ensure the longevity of specialist black bookshops in the future.</p> <p>Initiatives such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/01/black-pound-day-founder-urges-blm-marchers-to-spend-black\">black pound day</a>, in which consumers are encouraged to shop at black-owned businesses once a month, have helped the retailer in the face of online competition from Amazon, he said, but momentum needs to be maintained.</p> <p>Renewed focus on the lack of diversity in publishing and literature has prompted new initiatives, such as Penguin\u2019s recently announced project <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/oct/24/penguin-random-house-launches-project-to-boost-diversity-in-gcse-reading-lists\">to boost diversity in GCSE reading lists</a>, and the newly formed Black Writers\u2019 Guild has been pushing for action from the big publishing houses.</p> <p>But bookshop owners say there\u2019s a long way to go before the publishing industry and mainstream bookshops fully reflect the diversity of black talent in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cIn the long term, my aim and my hope is that we will stop being a bookshop that stocks black authors and just be a bookshop, because we won\u2019t need to be highlighting this stuff, but we\u2019re a long, long way from that,\u201d said Bain.</p> <p>\u201cBut what we\u2019re doing is actually changing the world, because if you read a book by a black author, it changes the way you see things, it changes the way you see black people. And that can only be positive.\u201d</p>"

The court\u2019s decision to take on the case follows mass shootings in recent weeks in Indiana, Georgia, Colorado and California and comes amid congressional efforts to tighten gun laws. </p> <p>President Joe Biden also has announced several executive actions to combat what he called an \u201cepidemic and an international embarrassment\u201d of gun violence in America.</p> <p>The case is especially significant during the coronavirus pandemic, said Eric Tirschwell, the legal director of Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group backed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. </p> <p><strong>\u201cGun violence has only worsened during the pandemic, and a ruling that opened the door to weakening our gun laws could make it even harder for cities and states to grapple with this public health crisis,\u201d Tirschwell said.</strong></p> <p>The court had turned down review of the issue in June, before Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death.</p> <p>New York is among eight states that limit who has the right to carry a weapon in public. The others are: California, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island. In the rest of the country, gun owners have little trouble legally carrying their weapons when they go out.</p> <p>...</p> <p>The issue of carrying a gun for self-defense has been seen for several years as the next major step for gun rights at the Supreme Court, following decisions in 2008 and 2010 that established a nationwide right to keep a gun at home for self-defense.<br></p> <p>In June, Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, complained that rather than take on the constitutional issue, \u201cthe Court simply looks the other way.\u201d</p> <p>But Barrett has a more expansive view of gun rights than Ginsburg. She wrote a dissent in 2019, when she was a judge on the federal appeals court in Chicago, that argued that a conviction for a nonviolent felony in this case, mail fraud shouldn\u2019t automatically disqualify someone from owning a gun.</p> <p>She said that her colleagues in the majority were treating the Second Amendment as a \u201csecond-class right, subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/loisbeckett/status/1386709855256285189\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&quot;The outlook does not look good for gun safety laws at the Supreme Court...the Court could issue a radical Second Amendment ruling that jeopardizes future progress as well as lifesaving gun laws already on the books.&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GiffordsCourage?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GiffordsCourage</a> says in a statement.</p>&mdash; Lois Beckett (@loisbeckett) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/loisbeckett/status/1386709855256285189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 26, 2021</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-6086d90b8f08080a7ae6c8fa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-26T16:15:08.834Z\">5.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Republican Alaska lawmaker Lora Reinbold is banned from Alaska Airlines flights, after she has repeatedly refused to wear a mask.

Doctors and nurses ordered 3m fewer vaccines for children and 400,000 fewer for measles specifically.</p> <p>For the first time, clinics were forced to ration lab tests for sexually transmitted diseases as lab capacity and supplies were diverted to test for Covid-19.

These protest plays, curated by Daniel Bailey, are the result of that quickfire commission. Combining political theatre with digital technology, they are available across the Bush\u2019s social media platforms, including Twitter and Instagram, and on YouTube.

Issues range from the use of the N-word to negotiating mixed-heritage identity and the emotional load of having to articulate the trauma caused by racism over and over again, the last of which is expressed in Benedict Lombe\u2019s direct address, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG-qhQhPR8k\">Do You Hear Us Now?</a></p> <p>Fehinti Balogun, who appears in Michaela Coel\u2019s BBC/HBO series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/14/the-week-in-tv-i-may-destroy-you-sitting-in-limbo-staged-das-boot-filth-rich-review\">I May Destroy You</a>, bases his film, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6p5-e99PKs\">You Just Don\u2019t Get it \u2013 And it Hurts</a>, on a recent conversation with a friend.

Anoushka Lucas, in Your Work, which is delivered partly in song, sings: \u201cAll the things I\u2019ve heard before are coming around again,\u201d while Lombe is more explicit: \u201cAfter black squares and hashtags and outrage, will you still show up?\u201d</p> <p>It is a powerful question asked of the world and it remains unanswered.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/bushtheatre/videos\">Available on the Bush theatre\u2019s YouTube channel</a></p></li> </ul>"

Like the current maelstrom, those protests burst on to the public stage in September 2011 quite unexpectedly, with a thousand or so people cramming themselves into New York City\u2019s Zuccotti Park under the rubric: \u201cWe are the 99%.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e02d9991bd261531cd76425b34a4412e56fdd9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e02d9991bd261531cd76425b34a4412e56fdd9f/0_0_3500_2433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Occupy Wall Street demonstrators march in the rain through the streets of the financial district of New York on 29 September 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"695\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Occupy Wall Street demonstrators march in the rain through the streets of the financial district of New York on 29 September 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Also in an echo of today, the Occupy protesters were met with violent police shutdowns leading to hundreds of arrests. The park was finally brutally cleared two months later.</p> <p>Nobody could doubt the success of Occupy in changing the nature of the national political and social debate. It put concepts of income inequality, of the \u201c1%\u201d, firmly and permanently on the map.</p> <p>But once the protest had been broken up, its resolutely anti-hierarchical nature, combined with the distrust of many of its activists towards institutions and infrastructure, meant that it had nowhere else to go. It dissipated into the downtown Manhattan air.</p> <p>\u201cOccupy was also a tactic, not a strategy, and one that could not continue,\u201d Chomsky said. \u201cIt had an impact: focusing on extreme inequality that is poisoning the society under the neoliberal regime. But from that point on other forms of activism have to take over, and to some extent have.\u201d</p> <p>Nelini Stamp, the director of strategy for the <a href=\"https://workingfamilies.org/\">Working Families party</a>, is well-placed to comment on the \u201cwhat next?\u201d conundrum, having been deeply involved in Occupy and now being immersed as an organizer of the George Floyd protests in New York. Though she agrees that Occupy didn\u2019t directly change America \u2013 income inequality in the US has <a href=\"http://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/index.html\">increased steadily</a> every year since 2011 \u2013 it did spawn a number of powerful campaigns to long-term effect.</p> <p>She points to the fight for a higher minimum wage and union representation for fast-food workers.

But to the protesters they are vital oxygen.</p> <p>\u201cTo maintain activism on the streets you need little successes,\u201d said Dana R Fisher, a professor of sociology specializing in protest movements at the University of Maryland. \u201cThink about the civil rights movement \u2013 it was a long, arduous, painful process to get the black vote, but it was sustained by these little successes along the way.\u201d</p> <p>Fisher believes that the huge sweep of protests in more than 750 cities and towns all across America holds out a golden opportunity for dramatic change to be achieved through the ballot box in November. Her recent book, American Resistance, tracked the impact of the 2017 Women\u2019s March held the day after Trump\u2019s inauguration.</p> <p>Studying the data, she found that much of the energy released on that day \u2013 the largest day of protest in American history \u2013 was channeled back into local communities and their congressional races. The result was that Democrats took back the House in 2018 in the so-called \u201cBlue Wave\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f5f9f866080bef5f581db2130c353c81dd2deb06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5f9f866080bef5f581db2130c353c81dd2deb06/0_103_3075_1845/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 is painted on the pavement of 16th Street near the White House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 is painted on the pavement of 16th Street near the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Vilas Delgado/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She sees a repeat of that potential today. \u201cWe are seeing amazing opportunities for people to channel what\u2019s going on in the streets into political activism, especially with such a crucial election looming.\u201d</p> <p>The question remains, though, is there a need for some structured vehicle that could absorb the positive radiation of the current protests without which the movement risks fragmenting and dissipating just like Occupy? Fisher thinks there is.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it will be unpopular to say this, but I think there is a need for some professionalized organizational ecosystem to support this movement. There is a void forming, and we need to fill it.\u201d</p> <p>Noam Chomsky also sees a need for greater strategic direction. He wonders whether popular movements will emerge \u201cthat seek to deal with the brutal legacy of 400 years of vicious racism, that extends far beyond police violence\u201d.</p> <p>Nelini Stamp is resolutely optimistic. She reminds us that Black Lives Matter was founded in 2013, took off the following year during the Ferguson, Missouri, protests over the police killing of Michael Brown, and has been beavering away at effecting change ever since.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a movement for black lives over the past six years that has never stopped. We have more infrastructure now for people to land and go places than we did then \u2013 we\u2019ve built more muscle.\u201d</p> <p>Is she not anxious that the euphoria of the current protests could fade over time into disappointment?</p> <p>\u201cI mean, I\u2019m always anxious about that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never seen a multiracial uprising in my life like we\u2019re seeing right now, and for all the anxiety I have every morning about what happens next, that gives me hope.\u201d&nbsp;</p>"

For us, this is about taking a number of key statutory and government agencies to task.\u201d</p> <p>Marcia Rigg, whose brother Sean Rigg died in Brixton police station in 2008, said the tribunal would give the families the opportunity to speak the truth as to what happened to their loved ones. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful message that says the families have not given up and they will not give up because they have the truth on their side. We just want somebody to listen to the real truth. And, at the end of the day, what we want is accountability.

This should have been a moment where football brought the country together in times of turbulence. It was a time to show Americans can put their differences aside and come together to watch the great US pastime of NFL football.

Even if the fans were unhappy about that \u2013 and they shouldn\u2019t be \u2013 why boo a call for unity?</p> \n<p>Said Houston star defensive end JJ Watt, who is white: \u201cI mean the booing during that moment was unfortunate. I don\u2019t fully understand that. There was no flag involved. There was nothing involved other than two teams coming together to show unity.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kansas City mayor Quinton Lucas defended his city on Twitter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/quintonlucaskc/status/1304256871767904256?s=21\">writing that</a>: \u201cWe\u2019re a good city of good people.

Because the message the fans who booed sent last night was crystal clear: for all the attention paid to the racism and police brutality endemic to America, there are plenty of people who are more than happy for things to stay exactly as they are.</p>"

Its chief executive officer, Jeff Bezos, on Sunday <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CBJrhdzHKNt/\">posted on Instagram</a> an email from a customer criticizing the BLM banner on Amazon\u2019s home page, and said the emailer is the kind of customer he\u2019s \u201chappy to lose\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/amazon-chris-smalls-smart-articulate-leaked-memo\">Amazon execs labeled fired worker 'not smart or articulate' in leaked PR notes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But activists argue those statements mean little if the company continues its commercial partnerships with police forces across the US and stands by its past treatment of non-white employee organizers </p> <p>\u201cIt is opportunistic of Amazon to use&nbsp;this moment to make empty and hypocritical statements when it is simultaneously building the backbone&nbsp;for many police departments across the country,\u201d said Jacinta Gonzalez of Mijente, a grassroots Latinx and Chicanx organizing group. \u201cThe company perpetuates policies and technologies that are clearly targeting and harming black and brown communities,\u201d she added.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/22/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-police\">Public records released</a> in 2018 revealed that the company had <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-rekognition-police-use-unknown-2020-2\">sold</a> its facial recognition software Rekognition to police forces.

Amazon <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-rekognition-police-use-unknown-2020-2\">said</a> in February 2020 it did not know how many police departments were using this technology, and the company did not respond to request for comment on Monday regarding how many police forces use this technology today \u2013 or whether those partnerships would be continued. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6f8068f4681076d001081f61f82953d77851b20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6f8068f4681076d001081f61f82953d77851b20/167_0_814_436/500.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon has called for an end to \u2018the inequitable and brutal treatment of black people\u2019.\" width=\"500\" height=\"268\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amazon has called for an end to \u2018the inequitable and brutal treatment of black people\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amazon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Activists have also called on local officials to ban police departments from making partnerships with the Amazon subsidiary Ring after hundreds of forces partnered with the smart doorbell company <a href=\"https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/amazon-ring/\">to use its footage</a> to aid surveillance.</p> <p>In September 2019, the US Senator Edward Markey wrote in a letter to Bezos that the partnerships \u201ccould easily create a surveillance network that places dangerous burdens on people of color and feeds racial anxieties in local communities\u201d. A <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvyvzd/amazons-home-security-company-is-turning-everyone-into-cops\">report from Motherboard in 2019</a> revealed black and brown people are more likely to be surveilled by the Neighbors app, where Ring users can post videos and photos of \u201csuspicious\u201d people caught on camera.</p> <p>According to a map provided by Ring, the doorbell app now partners with more than 1,300 police forces across the US \u2013 a 300% increase from just 400 police forces in August 2019. Amazon did not respond to request for comment regarding whether it will continue its partnerships with local police forces. </p> <p>Amazon also sells web hosting services to law enforcement agencies, including US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). Since 2018, a coalition of employees known as We Won\u2019t Build It has called on the company to halt those sales, as well as to stop selling facial recognition software to law enforcement. In a statement to the Guardian, We Won\u2019t Build It said the same demands remain. Amazon did not respond to request for comment.</p> <p>The company\u2019s track record with non-white employee organizers has also proven to be in conflict with its public statements regarding racial equity, said Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, a group of employee activists at the company.</p> <p>\u201cActions speak louder than words,\u201d the group said, citing Amazon\u2019s treatment of Chris Smalls, a black activist who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/amazon-chris-smalls-smart-articulate-leaked-memo\">fired </a> for organizing employees to protest against unsafe coronavirus-related conditions in Amazon warehouses.</p> <p>\u201cAmazon\u2019s words mean nothing when they are firing black employees organizing for better working conditions, when leadership planned racist smears against Chris Smalls, calling him \u2018not smart or articulate\u2019, when they deny our call for racial equity assessments in their business decisions and eliminating the environmental racism of its pollution, when they supply facial recognition software and Ring surveillance video access to police departments that are killing black people with impunity.\u201d</p> <p>Amazon is not the only company whose work with police departments have been in question since the protests following the death of George Floyd began. Last week, chat service Slack <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jgxma3/slack-blog-post-worked-with-police\">removed a blog post</a> showing how local police forces can use the app after some Black employees criticized it. Airbnb has publicly supported Black Lives Matter but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Airbnb/status/1267536619164151808\">has been criticized</a> for its role in gentrifying predominantly black neighborhoods and pushing out original residents.</p> <p>Amazon did not respond to request for comment or answer whether it plans to withdraw from any of its police partnerships.</p>"

Fewer people are aware that one of the proximate reasons why Milk and San Francisco\u2019s progressive mayor George Moscone were killed was because of their opposition to police violence and abuse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/05/san-francisco-1978-changed-city\">Assassinations, Jonestown and a punk-rock revolution: how 1978 changed San Francisco for ever</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The line from Derek Chauvin back to Dan White, the former San Francisco supervisor, fireman and policeman who murdered George Moscone and Harvey Milk, may encompass 42 years of urban history, but it is clear and a stark reminder of the persistence of police brutality and the efforts to which some will go to resist any reform.</p> <p>Dan White was a bigot who, in 1977, had gotten elected on a reactionary platform that included promises to \u201ceradicate malignancies that blight our city\u201d, but his actions were motivated in substantial part by a toxic mix of that bigotry along with anger and loyalty to the parochial interests of the racist factions within the San Francisco police department (SFPD).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73ff12102cac4f8419f2d15400601ce34d4806af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73ff12102cac4f8419f2d15400601ce34d4806af/0_32_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A photo of Harvey Milk on a sign in front of the Castro Theatre in San Francisco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photo of Harvey Milk on a sign in front of the Castro Theatre in San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Chiu/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>White resigned from the board of supervisors, the equivalent of the city council, in early November 1978, citing the need to make more money to support his young family. He then wanted his job back, but when Moscone refused to reappoint him, he killed Moscone and Milk, who he believed had urged Moscone towards his decision.</p> <p>But there\u2019s another component to Moscone and Milk\u2019s deaths that is directly relevant to the Black Lives Matter movement today. White was being aggressively encouraged to get back on the board by the police unions and others around the SFPD who needed White\u2019s vote to ensure the failure of a federal consent decree order before the board. That decree, if passed, would have accelerated the integration of the force and been a major step toward limiting the ability of the SFPD to abuse racial minority and LGBTQ+ San Franciscans. The vote was deadlocked at five. White\u2019s return to the board would have meant a 6-5 majority against it. If White were replaced by somebody chosen by the progressive mayor George Moscone, the decree would have passed by one vote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"437b804b64480858b880d6522141f30b6976cefd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/437b804b64480858b880d6522141f30b6976cefd/0_17_1918_1150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In this November 1977, file photo, Harvey Milk poses in front of his camera shop in San Francisco\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Milk poses in front of his camera shop in San Francisco in 1977.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moscone had been elected in 1975 with huge margins among African Americans and in the neighborhoods with high concentrations of LGBTQ+ voters. Part of his platform was to curtail police brutality and to support civil rights for gay San Franciscans and San Franciscans of color. This made him a radical in the mid-1970s, even in San Francisco.</p> <p>White\u2019s resignation gave Moscone an opportunity to get a progressive majority on the board for the consent decree and other issues. A smart and experienced politician, the mayor was not going to pass that chance up.</p> <p>After White assassinated San Francisco\u2019s mayor and the supervisor he believed, falsely, had persuaded the mayor not to reappoint him, much of the city was overcome with shock and grief. But in some parts, the assassinations were celebrated, not least in police headquarters, where police radio channels played the song Danny Boy in honor of their former colleague who had carried out their dirty work. Some took to wearing T-shirts with the slogan \u201cFree Dan White\u201d under their uniforms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40acf98308b5f704de5945e1487862f14428c357\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40acf98308b5f704de5945e1487862f14428c357/0_46_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators hold signs depicting George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody, during a protest in New York in June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators hold signs depicting George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody, during a protest in New York in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caitlin Ochs/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The police unions today that minimize the crimes of police officers like Derek Chauvin and remain opposed to any efforts to reform policing or address longstanding issues of systemic racism in policing are the spiritual and political descendants of Dan White and SFPD officers who supported him.</p> <p>As the Black Lives Matter movement continues, it is important to make these connections and recognize this history. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/breonna-taylor\">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/daniel-prude\">Daniel Prude</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/05/stephon-clark-police-shooting-no-charges-california\">Stephon Clark</a> and too many others are part of the long and brutal history of killings of African Americans by security forces in the US that probably predates the founding of the country.</p> <p>George Moscone and Harvey Milk were white politicians, whose deaths are usually associated with the LGBTQ+ civil rights movements, but they are also part of the sad story of police violence in America.</p> <p><em>Lincoln Mitchell teaches in the political science department at Columbia University.

These are issues that the diocese of Bristol, like many organisations, has been aware of, discussed and attempted to address. However, while we have taken some positive steps, it is clear that we have not done enough.\u201d</p> <p>Pereira launched a discrimination case against the diocese of Bristol after discovering the letter on his file.

Pereira made an internal complaint that was also ruled out of time by the C of E\u2019s clergy discipline commission tribunal, a decision he is appealing.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI suspect my journey [in the church] has been impeded by systemic racism, because of my skin tone.\u201d</p> <p>The support by bishops for Black Lives Matter felt like \u201cPR spin\u201d, he added.</p> <p>In a statement, Hill said he had used \u201cracial stereotypes which were unacceptable and offensive\u201d in his letter. \u201cI deeply regret the incident and I wholeheartedly apologise.\u201d<br><br>Faull said Hill\u2019s comments had been \u201cunacceptable\u201d. She added: \u201cI have made the commitment to address institutional racism and to recruit and support more BAME clergy. I stand behind these and my other commitments.

The table-flipping has gone too far, Noah quipped: \u201cFirst, introduce yourself \u2013 \u2018Hi, my name is Sean, and I\u2019ll be your protester this evening\u2019 \u2013 <em>then </em>you flip over the tables! Manners, people.\u201d But jokes aside, \u201cwe\u2019re living through one of the most stressful times in modern history\u201d, he said.</p> <p>\u201cIn order to have any honest conversation, we have to acknowledge everything that\u2019s happening: you have a pandemic, with people losing their jobs and people losing their lives. On top of all that, you have a nation that has been inundated with images of police brutality day in and day out.\u201d</p> <p>Often, Noah continued, people focus more on \u201cthe symptoms than the cause. Because right now, everyone\u2019s talking about \u2018what\u2019s the right way to protest?\u2019\u201d The real question people should ask, he said, is \u2018why does there need be a protest in the first place?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cIf I had a magic wand, I wouldn\u2019t be trying to fix protests,\u201d Noah concluded. \u201cI would use it to get the police to stop brutalizing black people. That\u2019s why protests are happening.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd by a white police officer</a> took place thousands of miles from the UK. But the 46-year-old\u2019s cry in Minnesota that he could not breathe has sparked widespread protest in Britain. In the past two weeks, there have been demonstrations across UK cities. The protesters, the vast majority of whom were under 25, chanted: \u201cNo justice, no peace, no racist police\u201d and \u201cthe UK is not innocent\u201d. The demonstrations were largely organised through word of mouth and social media rather than established anti-racism groups.</p> <p>Protesters carried handmade placards with the names of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/05/mark-duggan-shooting-report-challenged-by-human-rights-groups\">Mark Duggan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/01/sean-rigg-five-officers-cleared-of-misconduct-over-death-in-custody\">Sean Rigg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/22/julian-cole-police-officers-face-dismissal-over-incident-in-which-student-was-paralysed\">Julian Cole</a> and others killed or left disabled by British police. They chanted for the Windrush generation, the victims of the Grenfell tower fire, and decried the high <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/covid-19-death-rate-in-england-higher-among-bame-people\">Covid-19 death rate among members of the BAME</a> community. </p> <p>The Guardian asked the two women who organised the protest as well as other organisers and demonstrators what has driven them to this momentous time in the UK\u2019s history of race relations about the moment that made them want to protest. Black lives matter in the streets and in police custody \u2013 but also, they said, in schools, hospitals and workplaces. Six of the protesters in London explained why they were there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4abcf47e75eefb93c7e53721c6fe86338829af1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4abcf47e75eefb93c7e53721c6fe86338829af1/0_58_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"John, 24, mechanic\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>John, 24 </strong></h2> <h2>Car mechanic</h2> <p>I became politicised at a really young age, probably when I was four. I was leaving a shop and security stopped me and my mum. The woman pulled out a scanner and started scanning me from head to toe. My mum gave her an earful, but that\u2019s when I realised that I looked different, that I was a target. They automatically assumed that I\u2019d stolen something when I hadn\u2019t.</p> <p>It was an important point in my life. It\u2019s the same issue trying to get a job. Even with mechanic shops all around London, it\u2019s harder for black people to get picked for a job in some of these places. The mechanic would rather take the white boy and not give me a shot. Enough is enough. My children aren\u2019t going to go through similar racist experiences. If I\u2019ve got to be out here every single day, I will be. </p> <p>Police brutality is a strong issue here in the UK too. During the coronavirus pandemic, police started coming round my area and black boys like me were getting stopped. Their excuses are we look like we\u2019re trying to steal something. They are stopping me in front of the building I live in, putting me in cuffs, embarrassing me in front of everyone. You\u2019re putting your hands on my parts for what? Just to feel power that you can abuse? These things need to stop. There are so many young black people here, outside the American embassy, because we all feel it. </p> <p>There has never been a time when I\u2019ve felt I can call the police: they\u2019re more likely to suspect me than actually help.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36d22907cfa0bb3e60f0b1ad1eab2f1c12c5d3da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36d22907cfa0bb3e60f0b1ad1eab2f1c12c5d3da/0_1034_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chioma Atuanya, 22\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>Chioma Atuanya, 22</strong></h2> <h2>Former recruitment consultant</h2> <p>I realised there was institutional racism in the UK when I was 15. My dad lives in Nigeria and he said he knew someone who had died of Ebola. Everyone at school was making jokes, whereas I was worried for my father\u2019s safety. I told people that it wasn\u2019t cool and that they had to stop because what if I made a joke about cancer? </p> <p>Everyone started kicking off. Someone made a racist comment towards me and my mum got called into school. Not because of what they said, but because of what I said. They said I needed to stop talking about controversial subjects at school or I would be excluded. It was probably the first time I had a proper conversation about racism with my mum. I thought the teachers would be more understanding, but nothing happened.</p> <p>Since then, I realised it\u2019s a lot bigger than I first thought. George Floyd isn\u2019t the first man to die at the hands of racism, but there is such a hype right now, we need to jump on it. These are innocent people who are not sick and they are dying anyway. People are just taking lives here. </p> <p>The presence of social media has blown up the issue. There is a large black community online sharing everything, and it has brought it to everyone\u2019s attention. There is no shadow of a doubt what\u2019s happening and now everyone is wising up to previous things when excuses were made. Everyone is seeing it\u2019s all just smoke.</p> <h2><strong>Aima, 18</strong></h2> <h2>Student and co-organiser of the London Black Lives Matter group LDN BLM</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f0b9ffa430a12df92fc1572f9a05a38bb1b542f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f0b9ffa430a12df92fc1572f9a05a38bb1b542f/0_560_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Aima\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve grown up with so many videos of police brutality; videos from the US, UK and all over the world. It has affected me quite badly. It\u2019s been 10 years of watching people die online that has driven me to being so angry and wanting my voice to be heard.</p> <p>When I moved to the UK from Nigeria in 2012, I saw so much that I have never seen before. Seeing and hearing my friends talk about stop and searches has really affected me. There was a lot of racism in school; other students calling me the N-word, calling me a monkey. I\u2019m here today because I stand in solidarity with all my US brothers and sisters. Enough is enough; black people cannot keep suffering.</p> <p>Racism doesn\u2019t just happen in the US; it also happens here and that\u2019s why we\u2019re fighting. We need to realise that so many people have been harassed and assaulted by the British police. I\u2019m tired because systematic racism within the police system has been going on for years. Just because it\u2019s not talked about much doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening. We want people to be educated and to hear us. That is the main thing \u2013 hear our voices. I think marching has made a huge difference because everyone is speaking about the issue.</p> <h2><strong>Natasha, 21</strong> </h2> <h2>Student, co-organiser of LDN BLM</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11d27b43b669ed9fa479b12b676273862c930ecd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11d27b43b669ed9fa479b12b676273862c930ecd/0_1120_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Natasha\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>George Floyd\u2019s death was the catalyst for everything.

I think they all had a \u201cthis could be me\u201d or \u201cthis could happen to someone I know\u201d moment. This is a sign of real change and people want things to be different.</p> <p>I\u2019m here to call for justice for Grenfell. There are residents who still don\u2019t have housing. It was a tragedy. We want change and we want our voices to be heard. I cannot believe that in 2020, and even though we are facing a global pandemic, we still have to come out and protest for our civil rights and for our lives.</p> <p>You can\u2019t tell the oppressed how to feel. I hope that we can start to see some reform.</p> <h2><strong>Zoje Aig, 25</strong></h2> <h2>Creative writing graduate</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4009a05e302e6a28dae001b95c66c6ed83ec61a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4009a05e302e6a28dae001b95c66c6ed83ec61a4/0_809_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Zoje Aig\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>What happened at Saturday\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests, when police horses charged at protesters and how things escalated from there, is part of the reason why I\u2019ve come back here today. We aren\u2019t all that dissimilar to America. It\u2019s ignorant to think there isn\u2019t racism in the UK. There is racism here, there is racism practically everywhere, even in Africa, where nearly everyone is black. You have to educate yourself; look around you and look online.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure there are plenty of places that can tell you just how racist the system is. For me, racism in the UK was people in school making fun of your accent, people in restaurants wondering why you\u2019re not speaking English, people telling me they can\u2019t pronounce my name and asking whether I\u2019d prefer to be called John or Jack. It\u2019s wondering why they can\u2019t spell my last name, yet they can easily pronounce names like Schwarzenegger.</p> <h2><strong>Ruth Ngombo, 24</strong></h2> <h2>Student nurse</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af8e1d4a749dadb9da7b574227632ee9e51efbb8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af8e1d4a749dadb9da7b574227632ee9e51efbb8/0_1120_4480_5600/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth Ngombo\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It started when I was in secondary school. I came in for my first day, feeling great. My mum did my hair in little bobbles and plaits. The head of year seven, who was a white woman, shouted at me within moments of me entering the school. She said that my hair was not acceptable. She told me to remove it all. I was 11. I went to the toilet and cried. I wondered what I was supposed to do. The teacher would rather I looked like a fool and had my hair out than how it was. I just didn\u2019t agree with that. </p> <p>From that moment, it kind of shifted everything else for me. White teachers would say things like, \u201cYou\u2019re acting a bit ghetto,\u201d and I would think how is this allowed? I\u2019m here today for black women. We hear about what happens to black men in cases of police brutality, but it\u2019s black women that we don\u2019t really hear that much about. And, unfortunately, with black women who have been killed due to racism, nothing really happens.</p> <p>I felt like I needed to say something because it could be me. It could be any black woman and nobody would know our names. Black men, it\u2019s also your job to help take care and protect our black women. We are the ones who are going to provide the future.</p>"
