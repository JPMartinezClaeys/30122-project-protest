That\u2019s likely to become a crucial question as NFL players look for new protest tactics that won\u2019t endanger their careers or lead to financial penalties for their teams. Can respect still be shown while raising a fist, linking arms, or bowing heads \u2013 as some sports teams have done when the anthem has played in the past year?</p> <p>The Guardian spoke with experts in non-violent protest to ask how players might express resistance in light of NFL edict.</p> <p>\u201cThey have a number of options,\u201d says Dr Adolphus Belk, a political science professor at Winthrop University. \u201cThey can continue to kneel, raise their fists and dare the league to enforce this policy. Or they can engage in some other kind of demonstration: bowing their heads during the anthem or adopting a position of prayer.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/26/republican-lawmaker-says-nfl-player-protests-are-premised-on-lies\">Republican Peter King compares NFL protests to 'players giving Nazi salutes'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Belk says there\u2019s another option the might cary even greater symbolic weight than taking a knee, while also complying with the NFL\u2019s new ruling: \u201cThey can all stay in the locker room \u2026 they can engage in an act of civil disobedience by being absent, en masse, without falling afoul of the policy. It would make for a striking visual.\u201d</p> <p>Hawk Newsome, the leader of Black Lives Matter\u2019s New York branch, thinks players need to go further: he recommends making an impact by not showing up. Newsome says: \u201cI call on all black NFL players not to show up the first day of work for the first day of season. Send a message, let them pay that fine. And what\u2019s the NFL doing with all these fines? Are they investing them in programmes in the community? I think that\u2019s a question we need to see asked too.\u201d</p> <p>Money raised from NFL fines have traditionally been distributed by the NFL Foundation for programmes including youth football \u2013 though not specifically social justice causes.</p> <p>Some people believe the desire to protest could be greater in the upcoming season, now that the NFL has doubled-down on its position and explicitly silenced black protest. By the end of last season, very few players were openly protesting during the anthem, and the issue had become less prominent in the league. But the NFL\u2019s new stance is likely to intensify resistance from players, particularly as many view Donald Trump\u2019s consistent attacks on black NFL players as the reason for the new policy.</p> <p>\u201cThe president has said that players who kneel during the anthem should be run out of the league, he\u2019s called them SOBs, he more recently said they need to be run out of the country,\u201d says Belk. \u201cHe\u2019s now challenging people on their personhood. He might elicit a response that people weren\u2019t inclined to give him in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>Newsome agrees that the president\u2019s involvement has upped the ante. \u201cThe president should be paying more attention to race relations in America and less about what happens on the football field. Now the NFL have doubled down. They had the chance to be a shining star in corporate social responsibility. They could have created programmes in the community. Instead they chose to oppress us. Telling a player to hide in the locker room, stand or pay a fine is an act of oppression.\u201d</p> <p>Newsome, who made headlines after speaking to a Trump supporters at a Washington DC rally, thinks that the majority white fanbase of the NFL makes an irresistible opportunity for groups trying to advance equal rights. \u201cBlack people already know that racism exists \u2026 we have to invoke empathy in white America. We need them to take action.\u201d He says the NFL is a perfect stage on which to do that.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tWPMbQ_PCA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3tWPMbQ_PCA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Hank Newsome, a Black Lives Matter activist, addresses Trump supporters at a rally in DC</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The threat of police brutality is not just theoretical for NFL players and other sports stars \u2013 they are not strangers to harassment from law enforcement. \u201cIf we go back to what started the demonstrations in the first place, the extrajudicial killings of unarmed civilians at the hands of law enforcement, it\u2019s still happening, not just to US citizens, but to football players themselves\u201d says Belk. He points out that in the past two months Desmond Marrow, a former NFL player, and Sterling Brown, of the NBA\u2019s Milwaukee Bucks, have both been victims of excessive police force.</p> <p>Marrow said police \u201cknocked my teeth out, slammed me on my head and choked me out until I was unconscious\u201d when they arrested him in a parking lot in Georgia. The officer seen choking Marrow in a video of the incident was fired for use of excessive force and a felony charge against Marrow was dropped.</p> <p>Last week eight officers were disciplined and an apology was made to Brown after footage emerged of him being tasered by police after a supposed parking violation. Brown was not charged with any crime and the video of the incident does not show him raising his voice or resisting arrest.That\u2019s why the actions that NFL players take next matter: the difference between a knee, a fist, an abstention and a boycott is more than just symbolic. It\u2019s life and death. \u201cBlack folk know quite well that it could just as easily be them,\u201d says Belk. \u201cThere\u2019s no amount of economic attainment or success that is going to isolate you from this kind of treatment. For those reasons, the issue will continue to come up.\u201d</p>"

The Hate U Give is already the most visible product of this to date. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/08/the-hate-u-give-angie-thomas-review-alex-wheatle\">Angie Thomas\u2019s source novel has been a publishing phenomenon</a>. The movie, directed by George Tillman Jr, could well follow suit, with its built-in following and a rising swell of critical acclaim, especially around Stenberg\u2019s powerful performance.</p> <p>After the shooting incident, neither she nor we fully recover. Filming that scene was hard, says Stenberg: \u201cI had this understanding the whole time that this was real. Even though I personally have never experienced losing someone to police brutality, I understand it\u2019s something real, and within black communities we feel the pain of that institutional racism.

The Hate U Give follows Starr\u2019s journey from passive witness towards outspoken activism, as she awakens to the inequalities and injustices around her. In real life, Stenberg is already an outspoken activist. Two years after her movie breakthrough as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/28/hunger-games-cast-racist-imagined\">Rue in 2012\u2019s The Hunger Games</a>, she went viral with a self-made YouTube film called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1KJRRSB_XA\">Don\u2019t Cash Crop on My Cornrows</a>, in which she raised an eyebrow at the appropriation of black style by white figures such as Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry. She has twice appeared on Time magazine\u2019s annual list of <a href=\"http://time.com/4532104/most-influential-teens-2016/\">30 Most Influential Teens</a> (she turns 20 this week). She co-authored the first major comic-book about and by a young black girl (Niobe: Her Name Is Death). In June <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BkGrwx4hlyJ/?hl=en\">she came out as gay via an Instagram post</a> saying \u201cOUT &amp; PROUD\u201d. And just this month, <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/amandla-stenberg-writes-about-sexual-assault\">she wrote an op-ed for Teen Vogue</a> in reaction to Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony, recounting her experiences of sexual assault. However, she wouldn\u2019t necessarily label herself an \u201cactivist\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I learned how to present myself to fit in</p> <footer> <cite>Amandla Stenberg</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAs the world shifts, the context and meaning of that word changes,\u201d she says. \u201cI just care about making work that I think speaks to people and helps them, and I like to be vocal about the things I do and don\u2019t believe in.\u201d</p> <p>One of the 2 million-plus viewers of Stenberg\u2019s YouTube video was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/26/angie-thomas-the-debut-novelist-who-turned-racism-and-police-violence-into-a-bestseller\">Angie Thomas</a>, who was making the final edits to her manuscript of The Hate U Give at the time. \u201cSeeing her, all of a sudden I was like: \u2018Wow! That\u2019s exactly who I want Starr to be! This girl has everything I want Starr to have in her,\u2019\u201d Thomas remembers.</p> <p>In turn, Stenberg was \u201ckind of flabbergasted\u201d when she read Thomas\u2019s book. \u201cSo many of the details felt way too relatable to me,\u201d she says. For example, Starr lives in a black neighbourhood, with its fair share of poverty and crime, but goes to a rich, predominantly white high school, whose students blithely sling about the same urban slang that she switches off in their company (\u201cSlang makes them cool; it makes me hood,\u201d she observes). In real life, Stenberg also grew up in a primarily black neighbourhood (in Los Angeles), going to a more privileged, primarily white school across town.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d528ad1578e9e2fe4e4ec9032a8d231b2d0d9efb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d528ad1578e9e2fe4e4ec9032a8d231b2d0d9efb/943_772_3090_1854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Point break: director Tillman on set with Stenberg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Point break: director Tillman on set with Stenberg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erika Doss</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI learned really early on what it feels like to be black in an environment in which no one looks like you,\u201d she says, \u201cAnd I learned how to be very intentional of how I presented myself in order to fit in.\u201d Code-switching \u2013 that capacity to alter your behaviour according to the company you\u2019re in \u2013 is something that people of colour are especially familiar with, she continues. \u201cBecause you have the cognisance that if you are completely transparent about who you are in a space that doesn\u2019t accept you for who you are, it\u2019ll be detrimental to your ability to succeed. That\u2019s just a fact of growing up in a country that is still based on white institutions,\u201d she says. It can work both ways, Stenberg points out: her mother is African American and her father is Danish. \u201cHe was one of the only white people in our neighbourhood, so what I was experiencing at school, he was experiencing at home.\u201d</p> <p>Angie Thomas\u2019s own code-switching fed into the novel, too. Thomas attended a \u201cmostly white, upper-class, private Christian university\u201d in Mississippi, while living in a poorer, blacker neighbourhood. Her senior college project was a short story inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/09/oscar-grant-oakland-police-shooting\">shooting of Oscar Grant</a>. \u201cSo many of my white classmates didn\u2019t understand why people were upset over the shooting,\u201d she says. \u201cSome of them tried to justify his death: \u2018He was an ex-con. What\u2019s the big deal?\u2019 And I remember being so hurt.\u201d The short story eventually expanded into The Hate U Give. \u201cSo it was born out of that desire to not only show my peers and my neighbourhood: \u2018I hear you, I get it, I feel these feelings, too.\u2019 Also, a small part of me wanted to show my classmates at school why so many of us were hurt and angry and frustrated.\u201d</p> <p>As a result, The Hate U Give is a story that speaks to all sides. It is empathic to the African-American experience. (\u201cI\u2019ve had girls coming up to me crying, saying they feel so validated by the film,\u201d says Stenberg). But it has resonated far beyond (\u201cI\u2019ve had 90-year-old white women telling me they connected with the book!\u201d says Thomas). Beneath the racial specifics, Starr is a study in isolation. She becomes an outsider from both her communities, weighed down by pressures and anxieties nobody else understands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b96eec96fdbe8c226af57916ff2b0b354c87d3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b96eec96fdbe8c226af57916ff2b0b354c87d3b/369_51_3037_1822/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Youth in revolt: Starr schools her friends.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Youth in revolt: Starr schools her friends.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Fox 2000</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always a constant battle when you\u2019re making a film with African Americans or different cultures,\u201d says director Tillman, but The Hate U Give\u2019s themes are universal. \u201cShe\u2019s a witness, and there are many people outside of African-American culture that have been a witness. And she\u2019s got to stand up. Does she talk or does she not? There\u2019s a mother and a father and they believe in their kids. From an external standpoint, everybody can relate to that.\u201d</p> <p>Tillman also felt an extra level of responsibility making this film, he says, invoking that now-familiar roll call of victims. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/21/remain-shocked-philando-castille-justice-moral-outrage\">Philando Castile</a>\u2019s death came halfway through the production process, and he was in contact with the families of Garner and Bland. Tillman had some experiences of his own to bring to the table, too. As a film student, he recalls being pulled over by the police and thrown in a cell for the night simply for not having the right paperwork. When he arrived in Los Angeles, not long after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/01/rodney-king-learn-to-forgive\">1991\u2019s infamous Rodney King beating</a>, other African Americans taught him to fear being pulled over by the notoriously racist LAPD.</p> <p>Tillman also got The Talk as a boy, \u201cseveral times, from several family members. It came from my father, it came from my uncles \u2026\u201d In turn, he now finds himself giving The Talk to his 15-year-old son. \u201cI\u2019m very overprotective \u2026 you just don\u2019t know. A lot of the things that happen with police brutality or shootings, 90% of the time it\u2019s the wrong person; it\u2019s the wrong thing that happened, it\u2019s a mistake.\u201d</p> <p>Tillman made his name with <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120169/\">1997\u2019s Soul Food</a>, another African-American family drama, but, surprisingly, the films that spoke to him most as a teenager were Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s 1980s teen movies: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/aug/14/why-id-like-to-be-matt-dillon-in-the-outsiders-movie\">The Outsiders</a> and especially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/jan/02/mickey-rourke-rumble-fish\">Rumble Fish</a>, starring Matt Dillon and Mickey Rourke. \u201cI was amazed how artistic that film was, and it was made for kids,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was my approach to this film: not to make a YA movie, because I think kids are much smarter than we think they are. They get things much faster than adults.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f0c38af86d6dbfd17744f9507eacf7f8283f590\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f0c38af86d6dbfd17744f9507eacf7f8283f590/123_0_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Not a fair cop: Russell Hornsby, Regina Hall, Amandla Stenberg and Common.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not a fair cop: Russell Hornsby, Regina Hall, Amandla Stenberg and Common.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photo Credit: ERIKA DOSS/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thomas also had some unlikely influences. \u201cI was a huge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/harrypotter\">Harry Potter</a> fan,\u201d she says. \u201cI know people will be like: \u2018That\u2019s a weird connection to make\u2019, but those books were a defining moment, because they reminded me that as a young person I had power. They prepared us for what we now call \u2018the resistance\u2019, you know? We\u2019re dealing with a real life Voldemort!\u201d She barely needs to explain she\u2019s referring to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>; he\u2019s now He Who Does Not Need to Be Named.</p> <p>Looking at young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> activists, or the anti-gun violence movement that sprang from the Parkland, Florida school shooting, the \u201cresistance\u201d is making its presence felt. That change is registering in Hollywood, too, and Amandla Stenberg could well represent a new definition of movie celebrity. \u201cI\u2019m part of a generation that understands the potential of the work that we do,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to be coming of age in an era where we\u2019re tackling issues like sexual assault, where we\u2019re upending the infrastructure of Hollywood that has existed since its creation.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It would be a lot easier to keep my politics and my art separate</p> <footer> <cite>Amandla Stenberg</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Taking a stand is not without consequences. And the pushback can be empowering in itself, says Thomas. The Hate U Give has become one of the most challenged and banned books in recent US history. \u201cIt will probably surprise some people to know that I\u2019m OK with that,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause every single time it happens, there are young people who stand up and say: no.\u201d She cites the case of Katy High School, in Texas, where the book was pulled from library shelves owing to its \u201cpervasive vulgarity and racially insensitive language\u201d in 2017. In response, 15-year-old student Ny\u2019Shira Lundy organised a petition to reinstate the book. \u201cAnd they did it. And she [Lundy] told me: \u2018Now that I did that, I know I can use my voice to do even more. There are so many problems in our schools.\u2019 She\u2019s going to be calling them out.\u201d</p> <p>Stenberg has attracted criticism. For speaking up. For being too light-skinned to play Starr. And uproar is already building for her next movie, Where Hands Touch, where she plays a mixed-race German girl who falls in love with a member of the Hitler Youth. It\u2019s a price she is prepared to pay. \u201cOf course I think it would be a lot easier to keep my politics and my art separate,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that would make me happy and I don\u2019t think it would mean that much. It\u2019s your moral responsibility to be aware and to use your voice.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Hate U Give is in UK cinemas from Monday 22 October</em></p>"

A single \u201croach\u201d from an ashtray, containing a quantity of marijuana too small to trigger an arrest. The homeowner was given a written citation.</p> <p>Minutes away, at a downtown courthouse, the police department was entering its first day on trial. The case, brought by activists and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), alleges the Memphis police department (MPD) engaged in illegal surveillance of activists involved with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/01/fight-for-15-movement-plans-fast-food-workers-strike-across-south\">Fight for 15</a>, including \u201ccatfishing\u201d them with fake social media accounts.</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, the MPD said the timing of the raid was \u201cnot related to the ACLU lawsuit in any way\u201d.</p> <p>Activists feel differently \u2013 the homes raided belonged to the uncle and grandmother of Antonio Cathey, one of the city\u2019s more well-known activists and one of the targets of the alleged police spying.</p> <p>Following the raids, activists reported police searching a community garden, tailing activists in unmarked cars, and in one case pulling over a vehicle in which one passenger was an ACLU lawyer representing the activists. The lawyer was briefly detained, in handcuffs.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s most definitely intimidation and it\u2019s to show us that even the courts can\u2019t stop them doing what they want to do,\u201d said Keedran Franklin, a prolific activist who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/01/memphis-police-black-lives-matter-activists\">described being watched and targeted</a> by Memphis police over the last two years.</p> <p>According to Cathey, in the raid on his uncle\u2019s home police tossed drawers, left clothing strewn about the house and broke family pictures. When officers entered the second house, he said, they pointed weapons at his 71-year-old grandmother.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a retaliation to what was going on in court and it was an intimidation tactic but it didn\u2019t scare me,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Cathey, Franklin and the ACLU lawyer Scott Kramer were at the courthouse for the first day of the trial when Cathey got word of the raid. When Kramer arrived at the scene, he said, he saw a number of officers using masks and bandannas.</p> <p>\u201cOne guy used what looked like a white sheet on his head and then sunglasses over top of it,\u201d Kramer said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57c7872b8d648f1b368720a7b1aa02d37108d78d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57c7872b8d648f1b368720a7b1aa02d37108d78d/167_0_1694_1017/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the Western Tennessee multi-agency gang unit (MCU) in ski masks as they execute a search on the home of Antonio Cathey\u2019s uncle, James Cathey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the western Tennessee multi-agency gang unit (MCU) in ski masks as they execute a search on the home of Antonio Cathey\u2019s uncle, James Cathey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Scott Kramer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He also noted that several of the vehicles used appeared to display civilian license plates.</p> <p>In its statement to the Guardian, the MPD did not address questions about masks or vehicles. It said the gang unit was dispatched on a warrant on suspicion of cocaine trafficking, then moved to Cathey\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house and arrested his cousin on an unrelated outstanding assault charge.</p> <p>When authorities left the scene, Kramer was in a car with several activists who decided to follow one of the unmarked cars. They did so briefly before the county sheriff sent four vehicles to pull them over, for \u201cfollowing too closely\u201d.</p> <p>In a video posted to Facebook Live by the driver, Spencer Kaaz, another local activist, Kramer can be heard asking \u201cwhy are you putting me in handcuffs\u201d as an officer pats him down. The other passengers decline to get out. After some time, officers uncuff Kramer. He returned to court for the rest of the day\u2019s proceedings.</p> <p>Kramer said: \u201cThe bullet point is: on the same day that the ACLU is bringing a suit against the Memphis police, [they are saying] \u2018We can pull you over and put you in handcuffs whenever we want to.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Cathey reported being followed by one of the undercover cars later in the week. On Thursday, Franklin discovered that MPD officers had paid a late-night visit to a community garden maintained by activists in Memphis\u2019s Concerned Citizen Coalition, the group police are principally accused of spying on.</p> <p>MPD would only tell the Guardian there was no call for service made at the garden. It declined to provide a reason why officers might have been there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78cdeca826cc8692274f6f5e21950c4b75553fab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78cdeca826cc8692274f6f5e21950c4b75553fab/0_13_2997_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Activist James Cathey (left) chats with ACLU attorney Scott Kramer (right) after the last day of trial in a suit alleging that the Memphis Police Department was routinely surveilling activists in defiance of a binding consent decree.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activist James Cathey, left, chats with the ACLU attorney Scott Kramer, right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brandon Dill/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The surveillance project was operated by the MPD\u2019s office of homeland security, which officials said was \u201coriginally designed to deal with threats to the MPD or Memphis in general\u201d.</p> <p>In a deposition for the ACLU lawsuit, officials said the office had been \u201cretooled\u201d around 2016, due to an increase in policing-related protests and to focus on \u201clocal individuals or groups that were staging protests\u201d.</p> <p>This included the publication of daily joint information briefings on potential protests and known protesters. According to the suit, the briefings regularly included information about meetings on private property, panel discussions, town halls and even innocuous events like \u201cBlack Owned Food Truck Sunday\u201d.</p> <p>A good deal of that information appears to have been obtained by a fake MPD Facebook profile for \u201cBob Smith\u201d, which the ACLU said was used \u201cto view private posts, join private groups, and otherwise pose as a member of the activist community\u201d.</p> <p>In one case, the Bob Smith pseudonym chatted with a protester on Facebook, describing himself as \u201cjust a fellow protester\u201d and later saying \u201cblock me if you want, but i\u2019m not a cop\u201d.</p> <p>A federal judge is currently considering his verdict on the ACLU lawsuit. He has already ruled that the city violated a federal consent decree barring the city from engaging in political surveillance.

In Australia, those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/25/captain-cook-statue-vandalised-in-melbourne-before-australia-day\">arguments centre around statues of British explorers and pioneers such as James Cook</a> and Lachlan Macquarie, and their role in \u2018discovering\u2019 Australia and early European settlement.</p> <p>Even days of commemoration are contested. Australia Day, marking the beginning of British colonisation, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/26/huge-invasion-day-protest-melbourne-australia-day\">a day that many Indigenous Australians regard as Invasion Day \u2013 to be mourned rather than memorialised</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same in America.

Countries need to honestly remember their pasts in order to be able to build a fairer future, Newsome says.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to have a history that is truthful, that acknowledges the past honestly. For a long time, black America has been told to \u2018forget slavery\u2019, told \u2018that was a long time ago\u2019. Well nobody says \u2018forget the Holocaust\u2019, \u2018forget Pearl Harbor\u2019, \u2018forget 9/11\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to have the conversation about our history, we have to have the debate about the statues celebrating people who committed genocide.\u201d</p> <p>Newsome argues conversations confronting history must also acknowledge ongoing disadvantage. Pulling oneself up by the bootstraps only works if you have shoes on.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of bootstrapping, it says that you just have to work harder to get what you need. But that ignores that one group of people\u2019s situation is much harsher than another\u2019s, that some people start from a more difficult position. </p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to be given equality, just give us access, give us the same opportunities, and we can do the rest.\u201d</p> <p>Newsome stresses he is not an expert on Indigenous issues \u2013 and the length to which those can be compared to the experience of black Americans, who are not first nations people, is part of the discussion \u2013 but other BLM leaders have drawn the same stark comparison.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/26/huge-invasion-day-protest-melbourne-australia-day\">'People are starting to understand': huge Invasion Day protest stuns Melbourne</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSimilar poverty rates, similar mass incarceration rates, the deaths in custody that are being swept under the rug \u2013 these are all things we feel in the US so there is a deep affinity around this resistance and this struggle,\u201d <a href=\"http://sydneypeacefoundation.org.au/black-lives-matter-founders-meet-australias-indigenous-community/\">Black Lives Matter founder Patrisse Cullors said</a>, in Australia as the winner of the Sydney Peace Prize last November.</p> <p>Newsome came to global prominence in September last year through an online video showing a small band of Black Lives Matter protestors attending a \u2018mother of all rallies\u2019 pro-Trump demonstration.</p> <p>The video, now viewed more than 50 million times, shows Newsome and others walking through an openly hostile crowd to take to the makeshift stage, where he was invited to speak for two minutes. </p> <p>\u201cI am an American,\u201d he began to desultory applause. But he went on to argue that Black Lives Matter wasn\u2019t anti-police, only anti-bad police, as it was anti-bad politician. He said that America\u2019s strength lay in its democratic equality, in rights for all, and that \u201call lives matter\u201d. </p> <p>He finished his speech to widespread cheers: \u201cif we really want to make America great, we do it together,\u201d he said.</p> <p>This, Newsome argues, is the way forward in an increasingly polarised global political climate: greater understanding rather than firmer redoubts of positions.</p> <p>\u201cThere are people on both sides, who are very happy being angry. But that\u2019s not getting us any progress.

According to accounts provided by more than 10 migrants, some officers wear paramilitary uniforms with a badge depicting a sword upraised by two lightning bolts. This is the badge of Croatian special police.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey stop us and, before beating us, they frisk us\u201d, says Hamdi, 35, An Algerian language teacher. \u201cIf they find money, they steal it. If they find mobile phones, they destroy them to avoid being filmed or simply to stop us from contacting our friends. And then they beat us, four or five against one.

His case has reverberated around the world, inspiring admiration and opprobrium in equal measure, in what has become a global cause-celebre.</p> <p>As such, he could be regarded as the figurehead of the cadre of imprisoned African-American militants who are still behind bars today. Collectively they amount to the unfinished business of the 1970s black liberation struggle, as they languish still in prison in some cases almost half a century after they went in.</p> <p>B\u00ady the Guardian\u2019s count, there are 19 of them, two women included. That headcount is very slowly being diminished, as the debate around whether they have earned their freedom grows more intense with every passing year. </p> <p>Last week one of Abu-Jamal\u2019s peers, Robert Seth Hayes, was released from a New York maximum security prison on parole having served 45 years for the murder of a city transit officer.</p> <p>I had sent that initial letter to Abu-Jamal to ask his views about Albert Woodfox, a former Black Panther from Louisiana who had been held in solitary confinement in a 6ft by 9ft concrete box for 43 years until his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/19/albert-woodfox-released-louisiana-jail-43-years-solitary-confinement\">release</a> a few months earlier. </p> <p>In my opening letter to Abu-Jamal, I\u2019d mentioned that the warden of Angola penitentiary in the 1990s, Burl Cain, had tried to justify keeping Woodfox in total isolation for four decades because of the prisoner\u2019s commitment to \u201cBlack Pantherism\u201d.</p> <p>Abu-Jamal, 64, found that expression very diverting, judging by his response. Until Woodfox\u2019s \u201cillegal and unjust imprisonment,\u201d he wrote back, \u201cI had never heard nor read of the so-called crime of \u2018Black Pantherism\u2019! Leave it to the prisoncrats of Angola to actually coin the term!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"166961e7bb2bb8ca1547345e8c6397469a645e0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/166961e7bb2bb8ca1547345e8c6397469a645e0a/0_0_2148_3000/716.jpg\" alt=\"A supporter of inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal outside City Hall in Philadelphia, in 2006.\" width=\"716\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A supporter of inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal outside City Hall in Philadelphia, in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Fusco/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then Abu-Jamal did something that was to become familiar to me over the ensuing months. He took that one comment of a Louisiana prison warden and riffed off it to create an entire social theory of modern American society.<br></p> <p>\u201cAs we see from the obscene and unprecedented mass incarceration of Black people,\u201d he wrote, \u201c\u2018Black Pantherism\u2019 is but a synonym for Blackness itself. For in a society deeply imbued with white supremacy, Blackness is itself a crime.\u201d</p> <p>Abu-Jamal spent 20 years on death row and during that time concerns about the fairness of his death sentence drew international attention. Amnesty International took up his cause, the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/19/us/death-sentence-overturned-in-1981-killing-of-officer.html\">crowned him</a> the \u201cworld\u2019s best known death-row inmate\u201d and a Paris street was named after him. Among the movie stars, writers and intellectuals who protested on his behalf were Paul Newman, Alice Walker, Salman Rushdie and Noam Chomsky.</p> <p>As impressive as the high-profile support he attracted over the years was the vitriol he inspired in detractors. Philadelphia police unions worked tirelessly to keep him on death row and since he was moved to the general prison population in 2012 they have continued to work equally tirelessly to prevent him going free.</p> <p>Maureen Faulkner, the widow of Daniel Faulkner, the police officer Abu-Jamal was convicted of murdering, has been equally consistent. Earlier this year she wrote a <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/opinion/commentary/mumia-abu-jamal-daniel-faulkner-larry-krasner-maureen-faulkner-opinion-20180426.html\">column</a> in the Philadelphia Inquirer in which she said the real political prisoners in this story were her family. \u201cWe committed no crime, yet we received life sentences with no possibility of parole or reprieve.\u201d</p> <p>In April, when Abu-Jamal\u2019s case came up before a Philadelphia judge in a legal dispute over the handling of his appeals, Maureen Faulkner <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/news/crime/mumia-abu-jamal-hearing-maureen-faulkner-officer-daniel-faulkner-ronald-castille-terrance-williams-20180430.html\">appeared</a> on the steps of the court and proclaimed to local TV cameras: \u201cMumia Abu-Jamal will not \u2013 not ever \u2013 be free, and I will make sure of that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"line\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">line</a> </figure>  <p>My initial letter to Abu-Jamal in August 2016 developed into a correspondence that continues two years later. Over time it mushroomed into a larger project in which I reached out to several of his peers \u2013 black radicals incarcerated like him for decades \u2013 in an attempt to understand how they came to be given such lengthy sentences and how they cope with their enduring punishment today.<strong> </strong><br></p> <p>At a time when America is still grappling with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/26/lynchings-sadism-white-men-why-america-must-atone\">racial legacy</a> of slavery and segregation, when the issue of police brutality has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\">welled up again</a> through Black Lives Matter, when at least <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/06/16/the-stale-statistic-that-one-in-three-black-males-has-a-chance-of-ending-up-in-jail/?utm_term=.407c89085cd4\">one in four</a> black males born today can expect to end up in prison, and when inequality shows <a href=\"http://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/361370-underwater-nation-income-inequality-is-bad-enough-then-add-the-race\">no sign of abating</a> for African Americans, there is renewed interest in the perspective of the Black Panthers. Just ask <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqGwekWZeRI\">Beyonc\u00e9</a>, who injected a Black Panther homage into the 2016 Super Bowl. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Black Pantherism\u2019 is but a synonym for Blackness itself. For in a society deeply imbued with white supremacy, Blackness is itself a crime</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And so Abu-Jamal and I began to correspond. We would contact each other through a closed email network set up by the Pennsylvania prison system.</p> <p>With each email I would try and probe a little deeper, trying to get under the skin of what it was to be a black radical for whom, in some sense, time had stood still through long years of incarceration. Sometimes he would answer in short staccato emails, as though his mind were elsewhere; sometimes he would be thoughtful and expansive.</p> <p>Sometimes he didn\u2019t reply for weeks. It\u2019s remarkable how busy a man locked up around the clock can be. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to write to you,\u201d he said in November 2017, \u201cbut my projects (I just finished my booklet last nite) have eaten my time \u2013 oops, I\u2019m about to get on the phone\u2026\u201d </p> <p>In our exchanges he reflected on how he had become involved as a teenage boy in the black resistance struggle of the late 1960s, and why decades later so many black militants remain behind bars. He talked also about how his militancy as a former Panther relates to the critical movements of today, notably Black Lives Matter, which controversially he called a \u201ccontinuum\u201d of the Black Panthers.</p> <p>Early on, I asked him why he thought the judicial system had borne down on him singularly harshly by giving him the death penalty. He replied in an email on 23 September 2016: \u201cI think we posed an existential challenge to the very legitimacy of the System \u2013 and it unleashed unprecedented fury from the State. That\u2019s why they used any means, even illegal, to extinguish what they saw as a Threat.\u201d </p> <p>He added: \u201cThe State reserves its harshest treatment for those it sees as revolutionaries.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"978fbde13551e3f0a27e9d5b5c2842f6db3b5730\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/978fbde13551e3f0a27e9d5b5c2842f6db3b5730/0_512_1517_1293/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Construction workers at a rally in 2001 near the Criminal Justice Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, calling for Mumia Abu-Jamal\u2019s execution.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"852\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Construction workers at a rally in 2001 near the Criminal Justice Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, calling for Mumia Abu-Jamal\u2019s execution.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Mihalek/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mumia Abu-Jamal was born Wesley Cook and brought up in a low-income African American neighborhood of Philadelphia. He was given the name Mumia by a high school teacher as part of a class on African culture and he later changed his last name to Abu-Jamal (\u201cfather of Jamal\u201d) when his son was born in 1971.</p> <p>In 1968, when he was 14, a friend introduced him to a copy of the Black Panther party\u2019s newspaper, and he was instantly transfixed. \u201cA sister gave me a copy of The Black Panther newspaper and I was dazzled,\u201d he wrote to me in an email. \u201cI made up my mind to become one of them.\u201d</p> <p>Three years of head-spinning activity ensued as a Black Panther in Philadelphia. The party, though relatively small in numbers, quickly began to make an impact with its revolutionary talk, its audacious opposition to police brutality in black neighborhoods, and its social programs that quickly expanded to include food and clothing banks for low-income communities and even Black Panther elementary schools.</p> <p>The city at that time, he told me, was a place of \u201cintoxicating freedom, and gripping fear. The freedom? To be active in a part of a vast Black Freedom Movement was Living, Breathing, Being Freedom. We spoke and acted in the world in ways our parents never dreamed possible.\u201d</p> <p>The fear? \u201cEvery Panther knew, in her/his heart, that the State was willing to kill a Panther in his/her bed.\u201d</p> <p>He was alluding to the death of Black Panther leader Fred Hampton in a police raid on a Panther house in Chicago in December 1969. Hampton was shot and killed while asleep in bed. A subsequent <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/chi-chicagodays-pantherraid-story-story.html\">federal investigation</a> into the killing found that in the shoot-out the Panthers had fired one bullet, while the police fired up to 99.</p> <p>\u201cI was one of several Panthers sent to Chicago,\u201d Abu-Jamal wrote in an email. \u201cWe entered the apartment. We saw the bullet holes which raked the walls. We saw the mattress, swollen with Fred\u2019s blood. I was 15.\u201d</p> <p>The death of Hampton was just one of several bloody shootouts that erupted as confrontations between law enforcement and the Panthers became more frequent. Many years later it was revealed that the FBI had put several prominent members of the movement \u2013 the teenage Abu-Jamal included \u2013 under a vast web of surveillance. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The State reserves its harshest treatment for those it sees as revolutionaries</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The FBI\u2019s director J Edgar Hoover had come to see the Panthers, with their links to revolutionary parties around the world and growing popularity in black inner cities, as a major threat to national security. He instructed his agents to redirect the secret domestic surveillance operation, known as \u201cCointelpro\u201d, specifically onto black radicals. </p> <p>Abu-Jamal recalled the naivety that existed within the Panther party about the governmental forces targeted at them.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know about Cointelpro. When people raised questions, we\u2019d laugh at them and tell them: \u2018Stop being paranoid!\u2019 The very idea the government would read your mail, or listen to your phone calls, was crazy! We never believed we were important enough.\u201d</p> <p>The FBI certainly did think them important enough. It made sure the party was thoroughly infiltrated with informers, leaders were rounded up and imprisoned, internal dissent fomented. By 1970 open warfare had started to break out between west coast and east coast factions of the party, leading to threats, expulsions and internecine violence. </p> <p>An exodus of Panthers began, among them Abu-Jamal who quit the party towards the end of 1970. From then, he turned his hand to journalism, becoming a prominent reporter on Philadelphia race relations as well as a vocal supporter of Move.</p> <p>It was not until 1982 that the Black Panther party formally disbanded. By then Abu-Jamal was already in captivity and facing murder charges relating to the death of Officer Faulkner.</p> <p>The events of the early hours of 9 December 1981 have been the subject of reams of analysis and conjecture over the past almost four decades. Faulkner carried out a traffic stop at an intersection in Philadelphia, pulling over William Cook, Abu-Jamal\u2019s younger brother.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7814fda945b8081a52e4700b89290b3dca5cbfd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7814fda945b8081a52e4700b89290b3dca5cbfd8/0_113_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators supporting Mumia Abu-Jamal in Los Angeles, California, in 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators supporting Mumia Abu-Jamal in Los Angeles, California, in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abu-Jamal at that time was working as a taxi driver to supplement his journalism income. He happened to be driving past when he spotted the altercation between Faulkner and his brother.</p> <p>A shootout occurred. Faulkner died at the scene from gunshot wounds. Abu-Jamal was shot once in the stomach. In June 1982 he was put on trial, found guilty and sentenced to death.</p> <p>Since then he has consistently professed his innocence of the charges leveled against him, though he has declined to discuss what actually did happen that night. I wrote to Abu-Jamal in June asking him whether he\u2019d talk to me about Faulkner\u2019s death. I said: \u201cSo what did happen? What do you recollect of the incident? Who shot Officer Faulkner?\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month he replied to me. He began the email by saying that he\u2019d just returned from the eye doctor who in order to inspect his inner eye had dilated his pupils. \u201cMy vision is so impaired that I can\u2019t read the newspaper so this won\u2019t be long, I haffa be quite brief.\u201d</p> <p>He did address his case, in general terms. \u201cThe question arises, how can you getta fair result with an unjust, unfair process? Due process. A judge who wuzza life member of the FOP [Fraternal Order of Police] said at one of my hearings: \u2018Justice is just an emotional feeling\u2019.\u201d <br></p> <p>Abu-Jamal did not address in the email my questions about the specifics of his own case.</p> <p>While doubts persist about the nature of the crime, what is not in doubt is that Abu-Jamal\u2019s prosecution, as he remarked, was riddled with flaws. Amnesty International investigated it in 2000 and concluded that though they could not pronounce on his guilt or innocence, \u201cnumerous aspects of this case clearly failed to meet minimum international standards\u201d.</p> <p>A long struggle to fend off execution followed, sending reverberations around the globe. Twice he had a death warrant issued that would have sent him to the death chamber; twice it was averted in the courts. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every Panther knew, in her/his heart, that the State was willing to kill a Panther in his/her bed</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It took two decades of almost constant appeals to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/dec/19/pressandpublishing.usnews\">overturn his death sentence</a> in a federal court. Since moving off death row, he has more privileges but he\u2019s less in the limelight now, less of an international figure, as he alluded to when I asked him how much mail he receives. \u201cI probably get 6-10 pieces a day or 30 to 50 pieces a week (which is nothing like I used to get).\u201d</p> <p>He has slowed down in recent years in other ways too. \u201cI used to read 2-3 books a week. Now? 2 per month. It\u2019s a different environment. I leave the cell often here: not so on death row.\u201d</p> <p>As he gets older, health becomes more of an issue. He fought a tough legal battle after the Pennsylvania department of corrections denied him treatment for Hepatitis C, winning a <a href=\"https://www.theroot.com/mumia-abu-jamal-wins-court-battle-to-get-hepatitis-c-tr-1793911403\">federal court ruling</a> that has set a precedent that will help thousands of other prisoners across the country defeat the virus. </p> <p>He complains though that the prison authorities are still denying treatment to many inmates on grounds they aren\u2019t sick enough. \u201cPeople are dying from their denials and delays. Literally. $$$ over life.\u201d</p> <p>Despite health issues, he keeps closely engaged with political currents. In March I asked him what he thought were the similarities and contrasts between the Black Panthers in the 1970s and Black Lives Matter today. I was curious to see whether he was critical of BLM in an echo of the criticism the Panthers directed in the 1970s at the civil rights movement \u00ad\u2013 that it\u2019s a reformist compromise rather than the black power revolution that\u2019s needed.</p> <p>He replied that in his view the Panthers and BLM are \u201cpart of a continuum. The BPP was born in an age of global revolution. Black Lives Matter came into being during an era of sociopolitical conservatism, and rightist ideological ascendance. What is possible is subject to the zeitgeist of the period.\u201d</p> <p>He went on: \u201cI am reminded of [Frantz] Fanon\u2019s adage: \u2018Every generation must, out of relative obscurity, find its destiny, and fulfill it or betray it.\u2019 I think both movements have done so, if only in their own ways.\u201d</p> <p>He also keenly follows his fellow imprisoned black radicals\u2019 efforts to gain their freedom, decades after they were arrested. In one email, sent in May, he commented on the release of Herman Bell, a former Black Panther and member of its clandestine wing the Black Liberation Army, who had secured his own parole a couple of months before partly by denouncing his involvement in the struggle. There was \u201cnothing political\u201d in the double police killing that he was involved in, Bell told the parole board, \u201cit was murder and horribly wrong\u201d.</p> <p>Abu-Jamal told me that in his view Bell\u2019s release was the exception that proves the rule. \u201cIf a man is only truly parole-eligible if he renounces his political ideas, how could those who aren\u2019t \u2018eligible\u2019 because they aren\u2019t renunciators be seen as anything but political prisoners?\u201d <em><strong> </strong></em></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What I always find interesting is how profoundly different the American systems of \u2018justice\u2019 are from those that exist abroad</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are many who will disagree with the argument that the 19 imprisoned Black Panthers and Move members are political prisoners. For the police unions and the families of victims, they are \u201ccop killers\u201d, pure and simple.</p> <p>Yet no one could accuse Abu-Jamal of being a \u201crenunciator\u201d. Since coming off death row he has been resentenced and put onto life without parole. That means that he has no chance of ever persuading a parole board to release him, which in turn, paradoxically, has given him his own kind of freedom \u2013 to speak his mind.</p> <p>\u201cParole is a political tool,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s especially used against radicals to punish them for their political beliefs. I think it should be abolished. Period.\u201d</p> <p>One of the most evocative emails he sent me was composed on New Year\u2019s Eve last year. Maybe the end of the year had put him in a reflective mood, or maybe the calendar means nothing to a man who has lived for 37 years in a cell. </p> <p>In any case, he started riffing again, this time about the US justice system. He talked about how parole appeared to be a pipe-dream for black radicals in particular. </p> <p>He referenced the Move 9 again, the group from his home town of Philadelphia, six of whom will next week mark the 40th anniversary of their incarceration. He spoke too of other former Black Panthers who had in recent years been granted release orders only to have them overturned by the higher courts.</p> <p>Then he switched, in his own rather professorial way, to a more personal point. \u201cWhat I always find interesting is how profoundly different the American systems of \u2018justice\u2019 are from those that exist abroad,\u201d he wrote. \u201cUnder Pennsylvania law, life means life, with no parole eligibility for anybody.\u201d</p> <p>For \u201canybody\u201d, read Mumia Abu-Jamal. He went on to spell out for my benefit his probable fate. </p> <p>Legal scholars and activists in Pennsylvania have a name for it, he said: \u201cDeath by incarceration\u201d. <em><strong> </strong></em></p>"

Friday, the first minister was questioned about his government\u2019s position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the

Westminster.</p> \n  <p>But he said the UK government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \u201cmaking the

With more businesses due to open on June 15, that date will also see another change, with older Londoners losing the right to use the Freedom Pass before 9am \u2013 agreed as part of the financial bailout package imposed on TfL by government. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed9f6538f08b1e5da86a5b0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-05T07:48:48.962Z\">8.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Transport secretary: wear a mask, wash your hands</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Transport Secretary Grant Shapps </strong>has been doing the rounds today, defending the decision to ask <strong>all commuters to wear masks on public transport from June 15</strong>. </p> \n  <p>He told BBC Breakfast: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is an additional measure, it is marginal, we accept it is marginal and the scientists weren\u2019t in full agreement about it but we think it is worth doing absolutely everything possible.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He added that wearing a face covering is not as important as washing your hands or social distancing for preventing the spread of Covid-19.<br></p> \n  <p>He said the reason face coverings have not been mandatory so far is because the transport system has only been at 5% capacity.</p> \n  <p>He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I am afraid this is not some panacea, wearing a face covering has been argued about and the scientists have said before and I have commented before that it has been a debatable point because what happens is that as people take those coverings on and off, it can lead to cross infection.</p> \n   <p>I do think on balance it is right to do absolutely everything possible because it removes the doubt and provides some reassurance to passengers as well but it is not some panacea.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Shapps compared the new face coverings rule on public transport to the alcohol ban introduced on Transport for London a decade ago:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You won\u2019t be able to use public transport unless you are wearing it, so you could be asked to leave and ultimately you could be fined but I don\u2019t think that will be necessary in the vast majority of cases.</p> \n   <p>There were all these discussions at the time but in the end most people just want to do the right thing, most people just want to get on top of this disease and here is something small but important that we can do.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Shapps defended the Government\u2019s track and trace system, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/04/nhs-track-and-trace-system-not-expected-to-be-operating-fully-until-september-coronavirus\">the Guardian revealed might not be fully operational until September or October</a>.</p> \n  <p>He said the alleged delays only meant the app would continue to be improved.

But the Super Bowl\u2019s half-time slot next month appears to be facing an unfamiliar problem: a lack of people willing to perform.</p> <p>As the National Football League digs in its heels in a dispute with Colin Kaepernick, the star quarterback who refused to stand for the national anthem in protest at police brutality against racial minorities, the show this year has become more about politics than music. The fact that the Super Bowl is taking place in Atlanta, arguably the capital of black music in the US, has only added to the storm.</p> <p>Some of the biggest names in pop and rap, including Rihanna and Cardi B, have turned down the opportunity to appear, while one group that has reportedly been booked, the Adam Levine-fronted pop-rock act <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/02/maroon-5-red-pill-blues-review-impeccable-pop-and-middling-rb\" title=\"\">Maroon 5</a>, is facing pressure to pull out. Rapper Travis Scott, the only performer reportedly secured to join the show, is facing pressure from hip-hop superstar Jay-Z and civil rights groups to pull out. With four weeks to go, producers of the 13-minute event are scrambling to find additional performers for what <em>Variety</em> last week called \u201cmusic\u2019s least wanted gig\u201d.</p> <p>Gerald Griggs, vice-president of the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP civil rights group, told the <em>Observer</em> it had contacted performers who had signed up to ask them to rethink their participation. He said: \u201cThe majority of artists we\u2019ve reached out to are standing in solidarity against the NFL. They do not want to be associated because of the protest that was started by Mr Kaepernick against racial injustice and police brutality.\u201d</p> <p>Kaepernick, who was the quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers and led them to the Super Bowl in 2013, accuses NFL owners of colluding to keep him out of the league after his decision to \u201ctake the knee\u201d during the national anthem at games sparked a mass protest movement. In 2017 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/aug/30/colin-kaepernick-grievance-nfl-trial\" title=\"\">the player filed a collusion grievance against the NFL</a>, claiming team owners had conspired to keep him off the field due to his protests.

Trump, who was angered by the protests, said that if players refused to stand, NFL owners should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/22/donald-trump-nfl-national-anthem-protests\" title=\"\">\u201cget that son of a bitch off the field right now\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The Super Bowl half-time show \u2013 which last year was headlined by Justin Timberlake, and has previously engaged Lady Gaga and the Rolling Stones and witnessed an epic, rain-soaked performance by Prince \u2013 \u201cis the biggest stage in the world to bring our message to the world about the atrocities that are happening in the United States, and particularly in Atlanta, that have not been addressed,\u201d said Griggs.</p> <p>\u201cWe appreciate the entertainers for lending their voices in opposition and standing with us. We call on artists like Travis Scott to pull out.\u201d</p> <p>The first star to clearly link the Super Bowl show to Kaepernick was Rihanna.

     "standfirst": "<p>Police brutality is rife in the Brazilian city, but a new project wants officers to see themselves in a different light<br></p>",
     "body": "<p>In the city and wider state of Rio de Janeiro, stories of police brutality abound. In June, a security operation saw a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/brazil-latest-death-teenager-favela-raid-police-marcus-da-silva\">police helicopter open fire in the Mar\u00e9 favela</a>; seven people died in the raid, including a 14-year-old boy. From January to July this year, military and civil police killed 895 people. Human Rights Watch concluded that, at this rate, the <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/08/16/police-killings-are-out-control-rio-de-janeiro\">state will have its bloodiest year in more than a decade</a>.</p> <p>In the face of such violence, one small project is trying to make a difference by placing an artist in one police department in the city. Tatiana Altberg accepted the invitation to work as an artist in residence for a year with some trepidation, especially because she works with children in the Mar\u00e9 favela who see a dark side to the police.</p> <p>Altberg explains that people living in the favela see the police as highly confrontational agents of the state. \u201cThe perception is that they are mostly violent when they come to these parts of the city. They don\u2019t have a good reputation and are seen as the enemy,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cd6094d901fdd26ef2386db6afe808b93ccfd807\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd6094d901fdd26ef2386db6afe808b93ccfd807/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tatiana Altberg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tatiana Altberg was apprehensive of her work with the police when she started her artistic residency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabi Carrera</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The scheme, which started in January and is funded by the NGO <a href=\"http://republica.org/\">Instituto Rep\u00fablica</a>, and inspired by the <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dcla/publicart/pair.page\">Public Artists in Residence programme in New York</a>, is the first of its kind in Brazil. The goal of the residency is for artists and public sector workers to learn from each other. In Altberg\u2019s case, she decided to use art to change the way the police relate to each other as well as the way they interact with and perceive the public.</p> <p>Altberg doesn\u2019t see art as a solution to a problem. She describes the impact of her work as a crack in a wall through which a chink of light can shine through. \u201cIt\u2019s something that comes very slowly,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think that art can resolve a social problem but the most important thing is that it can develop a way of dealing with life that can help with other issues.\u201d She sees art as a way of facilitating dialogue, communication and relationships.</p> <p>She started her residency by listening to the stories and experiences of police staff. One woman told her of the time she had to deliver a baby in the back of a police car, another remembered having to feed the baby of a dying crack addict, and one man recounted a car chase where he had to avoid shooting the kidnapped child in the vehicle they were pursuing. \u201cI was very apprehensive and came with a stereotypical image of the police,\u201d says Altberg. \u201cBut I\u2019ve tried to put myself in their shoes. As I listen to their side of the problems and issues facing them, I\u2019ve realised that it is very hard to be a police officer in Rio de Janeiro.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ee0edb4de80b4203a4e3b03e18518065941d2807\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee0edb4de80b4203a4e3b03e18518065941d2807/0_472_4160_2496/1000.jpg\" alt=\"pinhole photography\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helio Moraes, a member of the police department does pinhole photography in Rio de Janeiro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tatiana Altberg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The police work in a building in a bustling and very violent and poor area of the city. There is not much beauty. Altberg\u2019s work at the department has involved asking staff to write down, anonymously, a memorable moment from their lives. She has also started <a href=\"https://parallaxphotographic.coop/resources/beginners-guide-pinhole-photography/\">pinhole photography</a> workshops. She set people the task of taking a picture of their world outside the department \u2013 and pinned the results on the walls of the dining area. The tasks allow police staff time to focus on something for themselves which is far removed from the violent nature and surroundings of their work.</p> <p>According to Luiza Mello, the director of a company that produces art shows and the coordinator of the programme, the project is much needed. \u201cIn Brazil, people don\u2019t have a good image of public servants,\u201d she remarks. \u201cThey think that they don\u2019t work and are corrupt.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/aug/03/rio-police-violent-killing-olympics-torture\">The police are seen as violent</a>; Mello likens the situation to a war which has been going on for a long time and won\u2019t end any time soon. Changing this image is impossible in the short term. Instead, her vision is to try and improve public sector workers\u2019 lives so that they can be better professionals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6b31f419b8303bcf95632c2133dda53c5a1c9ac2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b31f419b8303bcf95632c2133dda53c5a1c9ac2/249_0_3045_1827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"photo by member of police using pinhole photography in Rio de Janeiro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One worker\u2019s attempt at pinhole photography.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ce\u0301lia Souza</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whether placing artists in public sector departments for a year will fundamentally change anything remains to be seen. Even those involved are unsure, as yet, of how and whether the project will have an impact.</p> <p>Tatiana Lima, 34, a police captain, says Altberg has provided them with another perspective. \u201cWe live in a complicated landscape \u2013 one defined by crisis and violence,\u201d she comments. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad situation. The police have a very defined view of some people in society. This project is a way of showing police work in a different light and of understanding other people\u2019s lives.\u201d Lima, who is no longer on the frontline, would like to see this type of scheme introduced for all of her colleagues whose everyday lives involve fighting drugs, gangs and violence.</p> <p>Mello acknowledges that the project, which aims to see two artists take up residency in a different area of the public sector each year, is in its early stages. She believes artists are problem solvers and can help public servants to see things in a different way and inspire them in their everyday lives. \u201cIt\u2019s a start \u2013 a very small movement,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is just the beginning.\u201d</p>"

Albeit with a less lucid political subtext, SuperFly took the same position of blanket opposition, portraying the few police characters as racist, corrupt and all too eager to crack open a few civilian skulls. A slow-mo montage of hero Youngblood Priest beating the ever-loving snot out of a crooked cop is presented as a moment of cathartic wish fulfillment for the presumed audience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1ccffe6f86767339a308abe418a44fbac9aec6aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ccffe6f86767339a308abe418a44fbac9aec6aa/0_0_7380_3358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Ramos and John David Washington in Monsters and Men\" width=\"1000\" height=\"455\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Ramos and John David Washington in Monsters and Men.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy: Sundance</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The majority of the aforementioned films seek a stance with a bit more nuance, and so they must allow for the belief that cops aren\u2019t straightforwardly villainous as a whole, a notion supported by the very concept of black officers. Monsters and Men, BlacKkKlansman, and The Hate U Give posit the idea of the \u201cgood cop\u201d, a black man on a mission to revolutionize a broken system from the inside out. John David Washington does double duty in Monsters and Men as well as BlacKkKlansman, playing two men who join the force with faith in the institution even if they don\u2019t have faith in the people comprising it. As Det Ron Stallworth, Washington delivers an unmistakably Spike Lee-ish monologue about growing up idolizing the crisp uniform and the commitment to serve, a perfectly understandable dream when articulated by him.</p> <p>Patrice (Laura Harrier), a fiercely proud Black Panther and his romantic opposite, rightly tells him that his intentions aren\u2019t enough to change the reality that for many, cops cause more harm than good. She accuses him of the same charge that young, principled Starr (Amandla Stenberg) levies against her uncle Carlos (Common) in a charged scene from The Hate U Give. Though he might not hold hate in his heart or mind, he\u2019s nonetheless complicit in a larger campaign of bigotry against his own community. Except that both BlacKkKlansman and The Hate U Give ultimately recognize the utility of \u201cgood\u201d cops, either to ferret out the bad eggs or to serve a little justice for the people every now and then.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MM8OkVT0hw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3MM8OkVT0hw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Contradictions like this abound \u2013 perhaps unavoidably \u2013 in an ongoing discourse that freely conflates groups with individuals and individuals with ideas. Because cinema must couch its polemics in narrative, characters too must stand in for assertions and their rebuttals, imperfectly conducting a dialogue with themselves. In this case, the \u201cgood\u201d cop\u2019s torn allegiances to his badge and his race are intended to embody two sides in this dialogue, though the subject often requires an even defter touch than that.</p> <p>Even the most didactic narrative films traffic mainly in feeling and story, leaving granular analysis of a many-faceted subject to essayists and debaters. But while the particulars of who is at fault and why continue to take shape, the sentiment at the heart of the issue remains the same. Men, women and children are dying in the streets, and America can\u2019t afford to think of \u201cthe streets\u201d as a theoretical, remote location that exists on the news. If it\u2019s at the neighborhood theater, it\u2019s everywhere.</p> <ul> <li><p>Monsters and Men is out in the US now with a UK release on 11 January.

It is like being caught on a revolving platform and consistently dunked \u2013 at pointed intervals \u2013 into huge vats of wet paint: ochre, azure, crimson, vermillion, auburn, bisque, ivory, feldgrau and the inevitable midnight blue. As one emerges soaked in the colours, and the platform revolves, the melodies that draw around are thick and peaty, forming pools at the feet that slowly feed out over the edges in glassy rivulets.</p> <p>His music is cosmic in the grandest sense, a sermon on the mount emanating from a core of melodic through-lines out into the expanse of the stars. What makes for such a dense and passionate sound is not only Washington\u2019s bright tenor saxophone, a Selmer Mark VI, but the presence of two drummers, Tony Austin and Ronald Bruner Jr, both cornered on either side of the stage behind giant kits. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/06/new-cool-kamasi-kendrick-gave-jazz-new-groove\">The new cool: how Kamasi, Kendrick and co gave jazz a new groove</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In between them is the rest of his seven-piece band, and just when things sound like they can\u2019t get any heavier, Washington reveals there\u2019s more: \u201cI want to introduce y\u2019all to someone special, the man who taught me everything I know. My father, Rickey Washington.\u201d </p> <p>Now with eight people on stage, Rickey lifts up a flute and the band launches into Askim, a honey-soaked ode to an ex-Turkish lover also featured on The Epic.</p> <p>Washington hails from Los Angeles, a city he describes in a musical break as \u201cincredibly diverse, where people come from all over the world\u201d. He grew up in the working-class suburb of Inglewood and still lives in the same house he did as a boy, where he would practise for up to 12 hours a day like his hero John Coltrane, sometimes spending hours on just a single scale. Now he works on his compositions in the garage, where he has built a makeshift recording studio littered with instruments and inspirational posters.</p> <p>Playing songs from The Epic, an album Washington has described in interviews as having its origin in a series of interrelated dreams about a guard and a young warrior, he draws on a specific musical legacy. </p> <p>Often compared to the celebrity of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/wynton-marsalis\">Wynton Marsalis</a>, who arrived on the New York scene in the 1980s to reinvigorate blues and swing, Washington draws instead on the so-called \u201cspiritual\u201d jazz of the 1970s, when musicians such as Philip Cohran, Sonny Sharrock, Pharoah Sanders and Alice Coltrane were melding free jazz patterns with disco grooves and pop melodies. On stage, under the ornate hands of the pianist and clavinet player Cameron Graves, there is also something of Sly and the Family Stone, and in a crowd-pleasing interlude, a sampling of Michael Jackson\u2019s Billie Jean. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eea4ed5303f7b81bb66449643e2acb5992e00eb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eea4ed5303f7b81bb66449643e2acb5992e00eb1/0_39_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kamasi Washington\u2019s father, Rickey, joins the seven-piece band on stage at the Sydney Opera House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kamasi Washington\u2019s father, Rickey, joins the seven-piece band on stage at the Sydney Opera House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Boud</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In recent years Washington has worked with a diverse range of artists including Snoop Dogg, Lauryn Hill and Chaka Khan. But it is perhaps his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/06/new-cool-kamasi-kendrick-gave-jazz-new-groove\">collaboration with Kendrick Lamar</a> on the coming-of-age concept album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/22/kendrick-lamar-to-pimp-butterfly-review-fearless-in-scope\">To Pimp a Butterfly</a>, for which he played saxophone and wrote the string arrangements, that has made obvious his ability to move effortlessly between musical styles. </p> <p>This includes gospel and soul, sounds that emerge powerfully during the song Black Man, where singer Patrice Quinn strides to the foot of the stage dressed in a shiny silver suit to deliver a monologue: \u201cWhen he speaks all else is silenced. He is a natural-born leader. How does he see himself, the Black Man? The embodiment of intelligence, he carries authority. Some will seek to enjoy his grace, and others will seek to destroy his noble place in our world.\u201d As the rhythm section ascends, Quinn breaks into a sonorous wail somewhere between Yoko Ono and Diana Ross, while the lyrics again conjure the historical figure and plight of the African American male. \u201cNever was a man who was half as brave, as that Black Man. And his love, like the sun, seeks somewhere to begin.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/mar/13/womadelaide-2018-all-singing-all-dancing-festival-of-joy\">Womadelaide 2018: all singing, all dancing festival of joy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The lyrics nostalgically evoke the Black Power movement of the 1960s and 70s, which advocated for racial pride, self-sufficiency and equality for all those of African descent, but also strike a contemporary note in referring to the rebellious voice of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a>, a comparison that Washington has not shied away from. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/magazine/kamasi-washingtons-giant-step.html\">In an interview with Adam Shatz in 2016</a>, he said that he epitomises the movement, embracing a legacy of when \u201cmusic was a sword of civil rights\u201d.</p> <p>After a series of extended drum and bass solos, in which Washington and trombonist Ryan Porter stood to the side of the stage muttering amusingly among themselves, the band returned for Truth, a song from 2017\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/28/kamasi-washington-harmony-of-difference-review\">Harmony of Difference EP</a>. \u201cI wrote this one as a celebration of all us,\u201d declared Washington. \u201cDiversity is not something to be tolerated, but celebrated.\u201d </p> <p>Moving through five melodies, the band sounded looser than it does on record, Washington playing his tenor slightly more mellow to allow the percussion and vocals to breathe. I had the sense of listening to a whispered conversation, one where something sad was being said, perhaps the condolences over the passing of a loved one, and as Washington raised his fist to signal the song\u2019s end I heard the final notes as a defiant cry, a signal of hope in the age of Trumpism.</p> <p>Leaving the concert under the sails of the Opera House, I was in somewhat of a fugue state. I guess that\u2019s what happens when you witness a great artist in their prime.</p>"

It\u2019s usually young, unarmed black people who lose their lives. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trayvon-martin\">Trayvon Martin</a> was 17, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-brown-shooting\">Mike Brown </a>was young, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tamir-rice\">Tamir Rice</a> was 12. And so young people are affected by it, possibly the most affected, because they\u2019re seeing themselves,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Waterstones managing director James Daunt said The Hate U Give deserved a readership wider than only young adults. \u201cOurs is a children\u2019s prize, but there is no upper age limit to being stunned by beautiful writing of this visceral power. It is an extraordinary achievement, and it triumphs in a year of wonderful quality and creativity in children\u2019s publishing,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Children\u2019s book buyer Florentyna Martin called it \u201coutstanding piece of writing and an incredibly gripping read\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis book has provided an important step-change in children\u2019s publishing and our booksellers have championed this from the get-go. Angie Thomas has an incredible writing skill, impeccably adapting her tone of voice for each individual character and situation. She is a unique and powerful new voice for teenagers and adults and this book will undoubtedly be discussed for years to come,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Thomas, who is also shortlisted for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/carnegie-medal\">2018 Carnegie medal</a>, took out the top prize after winning the older fiction category earlier in the night, alongside Jessica Townsend\u2019s fantasy novel Nevermoor, which won best younger fiction book, and Joe Todd-Stanton\u2019s picture book The Secret of Black Rock, which won the illustrated book category.</p>"

The aftermath of the deadly mass shooting has seen students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/21/us/florida-school-shooting/index.html\">call</a> for tougher gun control measures, <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/374724-florida-lawmakers-reject-motion-to-consider-bill-that-would-ban-assault\">pleading</a> with senators to vote against a bill protecting the right to carry assault rifles and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AMarch4OurLives/status/965330458237067264\">planning</a> a nationwide walkout on 20 April.<br></p> <p>Winfrey has joined the ranks of public figures <a href=\"http://ew.com/news/2018/02/21/celebrities-applaud-parkland-students-activism/\">commending</a> the Parkland students for their bravery and courage in the face of what\u2019s become a typical American tragedy. In her tweet, she likened them to the Freedom Riders of the 1960s who fought against segregation and racism by riding integrated buses throughout the south. </p> <p>There\u2019s no question that solidarity from influential figures can help sustain the momentum being formed by the students. But there\u2019s something unsettling about Winfrey\u2019s immediate support of them, in contrast with her comments on the #BlackLivesMatter movement in early 2015. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/28/patrisse-khan-cullors-black-lives-matter-interview\">'We've ignited a new generation': Patrisse Khan-Cullors on the resurgence of black activism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In an interview with <a href=\"http://people.com/celebrity/oprah-on-recent-protests-and-ferguson/\">People</a> for the film Selma, Winfrey accused the movement of lacking leadership, adding that it needed to \u201ctake note of the strategic, peaceful intention\u201d which the civil rights movement used to enforce \u201creal change\u201d.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s true that Winfrey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/aug/09/oprah-winfrey-swiss-apology-racist-treatment\">is no stranger</a> to racism and prejudice. Throughout her career, she\u2019s used her platform to empower young Black people, <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/ripple-effect-of-one-act-of-kindness-oprah-scholarship/all\">starting</a> a scholarship fund for Morehouse College students and <a href=\"http://www.opportunitydesk.org/2017/09/25/african-womens-public-service-fellowship/\">offering</a> a public service fellowship for African women. But those acts don\u2019t make up for her condescending attitudes towards an anti-racist group that aimed to tackle police brutality and global white supremacy. </p> <p>Black activists are often expected to toe the line of respectability to appease bourgeois white liberal sensibilities. And while this tactic was crucial to garnering sympathy from white moderates in the 60s, it can reaffirm the idea that Black people have to go out of their way to prove they\u2019re not inherently dangerous or threatening.<br></p> <p>One of the key <a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/about/herstory/\">features</a> of #BlackLivesMatter was its decision not to have a single leader on whom the fate of the movement was entirely dependent. The expectation for a Black messiah to deliver America from the sins of racism is counterproductive to the reality that it requires mass mobilization to tackle the forms of prejudice which keep marginalized communities vulnerable. Protest has changed vastly from the time of Dr King and the Freedom Riders. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Black activists are often expected to toe the line of respectability to appease bourgeois white liberal sensibilities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That rigid standards of respectability politics are still imposed on young Black people who are also demanding not to be the victims of reckless gun usage is an example of how victimhood is often racialized in America. Like the Parkland students, both Trayvon Martin and Tamir Rice were young victims of gun violence. And yet they were never afforded the luxury of being viewed as innocent or deserving of support.<br></p> <p>It\u2019s been surreal to watch children and teenagers take on the politicians and organizations that have allowed them to become the casualties of political greed and lobbyist corporatism. While many of us have been heartened by the tenacity these students have displayed towards <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/us/politics/trump-guns-school-shooting.html\">Donald Trump</a> and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/florida-shooting-tomi-lahren-gun-control-parkland-school-students-response-twitter-a8214056.html\">conservative pundits</a>, it\u2019s disappointing that a figure as important as Winfrey was more than happy to welcome the resistance of predominantly white suburban kids, but dismissed that of young black protesters asking for their humanity to be seen.<br></p> <p>Recently, a photo <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuliannaForlano/status/966501970226962433\">emerged</a> online of a young white Parkland student with the words \u201cdon\u2019t shoot\u201d written on her palms. The intentions of the picture were questionable given that the phrase was conceived as a rebuttal against violence inflicted upon Black people at the hands of the police. </p> <p>However, the photo showed just how much the #BlackLivesMatter movement has shaped the trajectory of popular protest in our digital world. Because without the young black protesters who put their bodies on the line for justice and equality, we may not have heard from the women who said #MeToo, and we wouldn\u2019t be hearing from the students who are emphatically saying #NeverAgain.<br></p> <ul> <li>Khanya Khondlo Mtshali is a freelance writer</li> </ul> <h2>Sign up for the Guardian US opinion newsletter</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"form\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3228\" height=\"218px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for the Guardian US opinion email\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email of the latest opinion articles each evening\" data-form-campaign-code=\"US_opinion\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"We will send you the latest opinion articles every weekday evening\"></iframe> </figure>"

Similarly bowled over by the verdict, Patrisse Khan-Cullors, a friend of Garza\u2019s and a fellow activist, replied to the post simply: #BlackLivesMatter.</p> <p>A year later, after the shooting death of another black teen, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Missouri, those three words leapt off the screen and took on a life of their own. The refrain, self-evident yet historically elusive, would serve as a totem of the newly energized black liberation struggle, and for days, weeks and months that followed, bring race to the fore of the national conversation in ways unseen for decades.<br></p> <p>\u201cBefore BLM there was a dormancy in our black freedom movement,\u201d Khan-Cullors said in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cObviously many of us were doing work, but we\u2019ve been able to reignite a whole entire new generation, not just inside the US but across the globe, centering black people and centering the fight against white supremacy.\u201d</p> <p>In her new book, When They Call You a Terrorist: A Black Lives Matter Memoir, Khan-Cullors explores her own personal journey, from her childhood in Van Nuys, California, to becoming one of the leaders \u2013 if perhaps not as well known as others \u2013 of the latest incarnation of the US civil rights movement.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was most important for me is that I could share what I experience as a young person, in particular what impact incarceration and policing had on my life and my family\u2019s life,\u201d Khan-Cullors said of the memoir, co-authored with writer and journalist asha bandele. </p> <p>Looming large in the story is what she describes as the criminalization of her older brother, Monte, diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder as a teen, and how a lack of access to treatment led to his repeated arrest and detention. Khan-Cullors said her \u201cbig, loving, unwell, good-hearted brother\u201d was the kind of person who \u201crescued small animals\u201d and \u201chas never, never hurt another human being\u201d. Yet he was arrested in his own home in the middle of a psychiatric episode, she recalled.</p> <p>Khan-Cullors calls his incarceration the breaking point, the watershed moment that drove her into activism.</p> <p>\u201cWe rarely know what motivates somebody in their work and it\u2019s usually a particular moment in their life,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me that moment is my brother\u2019s incarceration, and the ways in which this country has decided to neglect, abuse, and sometimes torture people with severe mental illness, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/22/police-killings-disabled-black-people-mental-illness\">especially if they\u2019re black</a>.\u201d</p> <p>She describes how her brother would, while in a \u201cfull manic episode\u201d, shout at a woman after a fender bender, words that she took as a threat. In California, and many states, this can trigger a charge of \u201cterroristic threats\u201d, part of the inspiration for the title of the book. </p> <p>Khan-Cullors later saw a charge of terrorism levied at her, rhetorically, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/15/donald-trump-press-conference-far-right-defends-charlottesville\">opponents of BLM</a>. (California has since renamed the offense \u201ccriminal threats\u201d.)</p> <p>In the memoir, Khan-Cullor also reflects on her father, Gabriel, his struggles with addiction, his own incarcerations for drug offenses and the social and political conditions that fuel abuses of drugs and the justice system.</p> <p>\u201cHis real addiction is to the fast-paced energy of it all,\u201d Khan-Cullors writes. \u201cHow else was a man like him ever going to have some money in his pocket, decent clothes, be viewed as someone who mattered?\u201d</p> <p>In this way, the memoir hints at many of the broader ways black lives ought to matter \u2013 not just when a police officer or vigilante kills an unarmed black teen, but in the broadest sense: to matter every day.</p> <p>\u201cWe deserve,\u201d Khan-Cullors writes, \u201cwhat so many others take for granted.\u201d On that list are sustenance (\u201chealthy, organic and whole food\u201d), shelter (\u201chomes that are safe and non-toxic\u201d), knowledge (\u201cmentors and teachers\u201d), and love (\u201cthick, full-bodied and healthy\u201d).</p> <p>This philosophy is part of the conceptual background behind the BLM network that Khan-Cullors would go on to co-found with Garza and a third organizer, Opal Tometi. The project today boasts more than 40 official chapters worldwide, and has inspired dozens of unofficial local offshoots . Official BLM chapters place a heavy emphasis on what they call \u201ccentering\u201d women and LGBTQ people, as a corrective to the male, straight and cis-gendered focus of past black movements.<br></p> <p>The effort to realize change, today, extends to the protest actions. Some of the organizing strategies BLM has become famous for (or infamous, depending on whom you ask) include vast marches, human blockades of cars, and interruptions at political rallies and speeches. </p> <p>Toward the end of the memoir, Khan-Cullors reflects on the intention behind those actions, and how they make people outside of the movement uncomfortable or purposely inconvenience them in the service of an argument.</p> <p>\u201cI just wanted folks to take a moment and just feel what this must be like for a community that experiences this on a daily basis,\u201d Khan-Cullors said, thinking about the police helicopters overhead, the armored officers and what it means to beckon those forces into posh, monied areas, like Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, with a protest.</p> <p>In the book, she contrasts \u201cthose who come for brunch\u201d with the movement for whom \u201cthis is our every day\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI ask the people who are lunching,\u201d she writes, \u201cto remember the dead, and to remember that once they were alive and that their lives mattered.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>What is it like for young black children to grow up in the US in the age of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/28/when-they-call-you-a-terrorist-black-lives-matter-review\">Black Lives Matter</a>? So asks Br\u2019er Cotton, <a href=\"https://thisstage.la/2017/09/tearrance-arvelle-chisholms-heart-sinks-in-brer-cotton/\">Tearrance Arvelle Chisholm</a>\u2019s new play, set in a Virginia community on the site of a former cotton mill. </p> <p>Fourteen-year-old Ruffrino Witherspoon is newly militant and filled with hate for the police, disdain towards the justice system and anger at white people. His father is serving a life sentence in prison. His mother, Nadine, works constantly as a maid, and his grandfather Matthew, who claims his own death is imminent, rubbishes most of his grandson\u2019s politics.</p> <p>The script is bold, brave and very, very funny, as well as feeling impressively fast-paced for a production that runs for two hours and 15 minutes. As Ruffrino, Michael Ajao expresses teenage rage well, and his interactions with Trevor A Toussaint\u2019s charming, droll Matthew help to show the generational divide that many young people experience when dissecting politics with their relatives. Kiza Deen is wonderful as Nadine, and her part is extremely well written: each time she comes on stage, we are reminded that for many struggling black mothers, grand ideas of revolution come second to paying the bills.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd0d79453121432d8457c5198e3b6baee8990fb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd0d79453121432d8457c5198e3b6baee8990fb2/186_492_4034_2424/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Ajao with Kiza Deen (Nadine) and Trevor A Toussaint.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Showtime \u2026 Michael Ajao with Kiza Deen (Nadine) and Trevor A Toussaint.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The script and actors more than hold their own, but it\u2019s Br\u2019er Cotton\u2019s creative team that really shines. Roy Alexander Weise\u2019s direction makes use of a compact space with ease; the actors almost glide across the stage, and the framing of more dreamlike sequences is impressive. Amy Mae\u2019s lighting allows the shifts from kitchen to moonlit cotton field to dystopian video-game wasteland appear seamless, while Harry Johnson\u2019s sound design is subtle but deeply effective.</p> <p>Incorporating video tech is particularly tricky on small stages; too much and you risk overwhelming the actors, too little and the audience may wonder what the point is. Br\u2019er Cotton finds the middle ground, with video designer Louise Rhoades-Brown skilfully bringing Chisholm\u2019s more abstract stage directions to life. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/news/br-er-cotton-young-black-theatre503-set-piece_45979.html\">Jemima Robinson</a>\u2019s simple stage design is arresting: walls are adorned with the names, ages, location and year of death of dozens of African Americans in the US who have been killed by police. It gives the effect of the dead closing in on the Witherspoons. They are surrounded by them. The surprise post-interval staging change is also a visual treat. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/28/when-they-call-you-a-terrorist-black-lives-matter-review\">When They Call You a Terrorist review: Black Lives Matter memoir convinces</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not all moments work as well as others. While Ellie Turner as Ruffrino\u2019s Xbox Live partner (known only as Caged_Bird99) plays the space between earnest and hopeful well, her renditions of spoken word-like poetry edge towards cringe. The final-act revelation of who she really is and her too-brief discussion of disability similarly feel a little clunky. Ruffrino\u2019s final showdown with a white police officer doesn\u2019t have much in the way of dramatic suspense and Br\u2019er Cotton\u2019s ending feels depressingly inevitable \u2013 although perhaps that\u2019s the point. Jarring and painful, the play\u2019s final scene allows Ruffrino to look like what he is: a terrified teenage boy, buckling under the weight of a violent world he is too young to deal with. This is an important play, and a great one, that will leave audiences thinking for a long time. </p> <ul> <li>At <a href=\"https://theatre503.com/whats-on/brer-cotton/\">Theatre 503, London, until 31 March</a>.

She comes out as queer at 16, then falls in love with a boy two years later. Eventually she marries that boy. When she leaves him, she remains close to him as a fellow activist. Later there is another boyfriend, who fathers her son, and then another marriage, to Janaya Khan, a black, queer, gender-nonconforming activist, also known as future.</p> <p>Activism is always at the heart of Khan-Cullors\u2019 life, whether she is organizing mass protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after Michael Brown is shot by a white policeman in 2014, or fighting to legalize marijuana in California because \u201cmarijuana is the fourth-leading case of deportation, and every night in LA County 500 people sit in the jail simply for possessing it.\u201d</p> <p>She is always aware that she is picking up the torch from previous generations of activists, from the Deacons of Defense, who organized against white vigilantes in Louisiana in 1964 and 1965, to Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, the Black Panthers who began their fight against the brutality of the Oakland police in 1966. </p> <p>\u201cWe were and are their progeny,\u201d she writes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have to talk very specifically about the anti-black racism that stalks us until it kills us</p> <footer> <cite>Patrisse Khan-Cullors</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The book is peppered with statistics that remind us racism is pervasive throughout the US, even in a very blue state like California where \u201ca human being is killed by a police officer roughly every 72 hours\u201d and \u201c63% of these people killed by police are black or Latino. Black people, 6% of the California population, are targeted and killed at five times the rate of whites.\u201d</p> <p>Her own brother, mentally ill and wheelchair-bound, is brutally tortured in a California prison. Shortly after he returns home in 2011, she experiences a terrible shock of recognition when she reads a complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of southern California, which alleges systematic torture by the Los Angeles sheriff\u2019s department in the county jail. </p> <p>Among the victims is a \u201ca wheelchair-bound prisoner whom deputies pulled off his bed, kicked and kneed in his ribs, back and neck \u2026 I begin to hyperventilate and remember my brother on his knees drinking out of the toilet. My God.\u201d</p> <p>Somehow, through all the traumas suffered by friends and close family members, Khan-Cullors manages to sustain herself with her activism. </p> <p>\u201cIn the wake of the acquittal of Trayvon Martin\u2019s killer,\u201d she writes, \u201cwe have to change the conversation. We have to talk very specifically about the anti-black racism that stalks us until it kills us \u2026 There is something quite basic that has to be addressed in the culture, in the hearts and minds of people who have benefitted from, and were raised up on, the notion that black people are not fully human.\u201d</p> <p> She has devoted her life, she writes, to \u201ctrying to get people to see that as much as there is a progressive movement for justice, there are those working just as hard for the opposite outcome, an outcome where only the fewest of lives matter at all\u201d.</p> <p>On the first anniversary of the inauguration of Donald Trump, the first president of modern times to use the White House to blatantly fan the flames of racism, the mission of Khan-Cullors and her fellow activists has never been more important \u2013 or more urgent.</p>"

     "body": "<p>David Lammy is one of those politicians whose public profile has never correlated with his position in his party, or converted into frontbench power, and this sort of maverick celebrity operator tends to attract suspicion. Elected to represent Tottenham 18 years ago, the 46-year-old has at various key moments \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/26/grenfell-tower-fire-david-lammy\">the Grenfell fire</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/feb/07/david-lammy-tottenham-police-riots\">London riots</a> \u2013 distinguished himself in the public\u2019s affection by seizing individual ownership of the agenda. To some, particularly in Westminster, this highly personalised brand of political identity is opportunistic self-promotion, artfully disguised as heroism.</p> <p>To me, his politics look sincere and principled, I\u2019ve just never been entirely sure what they are. He used to joke: \u201cI\u2019m not Blair, I\u2019m not Brown, I\u2019m just black.\u201d And he has successfully eluded all association with any ideological faction with such dexterity that he can sometimes look a bit slippery, as if his public persona is contingent on whatever strategy he has devised to please his audience.</p> <p>We meet in the Bernie Grant Arts Centre in Tottenham on Thursday, to discuss the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/04/killed-in-2018-londons-victims-of-violence\">violent crime surge that has cost 51 lives in London this year</a>. More than half of the victims have been young \u2013 in their 20s and younger \u2013 and poor. I am not expecting much more than for Lammy to offer carefully calibrated, bland reassurances. It takes less than five minutes to see how wrong I am.</p> <p>Lammy woke up on Tuesday to a text informing him that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/03/tottenham-shooting-london-violence-worse-than-ever-says-mp\">Tanesha Melbourne-Blake</a>, a 17-year-old girl, had been gunned down in a drive-by shooting in his constituency. This time, he decided, he would not let the murder go unnoticed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/03/girl-shot-dead-tottenham-north-london\">Teenage girl shot dead in Tottenham, north London</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cTo be honest,\u201d he says, \u201cI was shocked that four weeks ago, when a moped and pillion passenger gunned down a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/08/teenager-shot-dead-near-london-cinema-complex-wood-green\">young man standing outside the cinema in Wood Green</a>, that there was not more national attention on that shooting.\u201d How does he explain the apparent indifference? \u201cBecause he was black.\u201d He delivers this with such force, his words ring out across the cafe. \u201cBecause he was black,\u201d he repeats. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019ve got to ask ourselves, do black lives matter?\u201d</p> <p>For the next hour, Lammy barely draws breath. Only twice does he pause to consider the impact of what he is about to say. Even in private, I have never heard a politician hold forth with such utter disregard for his or her audience.</p> <p>The first thing Lammy wants us to understand is the blameless ease with which a child who goes home to an empty council estate flat because his mum can\u2019t afford childcare while she\u2019s at work, can become a gang member. All it takes is a gift of new trainers, he says, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/01/arresting-kids-not-stop-knife-crime-stabbings-london\">which in return the child is soon asked to carry a little package round the corner,</a> and before long, the 12-year-old is earning more in one week than his parents make in a year. The white middle-class market for cocaine is booming, Lammy says, citing reports by Interpol and Europol, and he has seen for himself how easy it is to service because dealers in Tottenham have shown him. \u201cPeople are ordering drugs on WhatsApp, Snapchat. It\u2019s easy.\u201d One young constituent was caught selling cocaine in Aberdeen: dealers in London now operate what are known as \u201ccounty lines\u201d, supplying cocaine to every region of the country. Do middle-class customers safe in neighbourhoods far away from Tottenham\u2019s turf wars have blood on their hands? For a moment he pauses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc40f4184df148819838d834f97b94dd3211adc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc40f4184df148819838d834f97b94dd3211adc4/47_707_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tributes left for 17-year-old Tanesha Melbourne-Blake, who was killed in a drive-by shooting in Tottenham, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tributes left for 17-year-old Tanesha Melbourne-Blake, who was killed in a drive-by shooting in Tottenham, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think they have got to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/09/city-firms-failing-to-tackle-cocaine-crisis\">make the connection between their drug use and what is happening with that drug</a>. But actually,\u201d he goes on impatiently, \u201cthere are much bigger questions. It\u2019s bigger than just making people feel guilty. There are big public policy questions about what to do about this, but there is no major public discourse about what we\u2019re going to do. Most people think the war on drugs has not worked \u2013 but nothing has replaced it. There is some debate about decriminalisation, particularly of marijuana, and it is happening in some parts of the world, but it\u2019s not reached our shores yet. This is not currently being discussed in the mainstream.\u201d</p> <p>Surely, then, I say, this is the time for the political courage to stand up and admit the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d has failed? Far from protecting us, our drug laws have delivered an \u00a311bn cocaine industry into the hands of teenagers, putting all of us in danger. \u201cYes,\u201d he agrees. \u201cYes. I think it is.\u201d The heavy flatness of his tone suggests he finds no pleasure in concluding that prohibition has been a terrible mistake. Does culpability therefore rest, ultimately, with the legislators responsible for passing and perpetuating those laws? \u201cYes. That\u2019s right. I think that is basically right.\u201d Looking suddenly anxious, he adds: \u201cLook, all I\u2019m saying is that there is no debate at all going on in this country about it.\u201d</p> <p>He could start one himself, I suggest. A Christian ex-barrister, born to inner-city, working-class Guyanese immigrants, his credibility confers an authority that spans council estates and the Commons, and makes him an ideal candidate to introduce a radical rethink. I\u2019m not expecting the suggestion to fly him into a rage, so am a bit taken aback when his arms begin to swoop like an angry swan and his voice rises to a shout.</p> <p>\u201cLook, why have I got to start everything? No, I mean it. Why have I got to fucking start everything?\u201d He is furious. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m here in this constituency, it\u2019s bloody tough. Why is there a political vacuum? Where is the prime minister? Where is the home secretary? Where is Sadiq Khan? There\u2019s a riot, everyone\u2019s on holiday? David? Kids get killed? David?</p> <p>\u201cSo I have to start every debate. I have to be in every discussion. It\u2019s very frustrating. I want other people to step up to leadership. I can\u2019t do this all on my own. Quite rightly, folk on the street are pretty pissed off, they\u2019re really frustrated with politicians, they want action. I hear: \u2018David, can you do this? \u2018David, can you do that?\u2019 I\u2019m trying, but I can\u2019t.\u201d He sighs. \u201cI find it slightly odd that I am asked to be the urban guru. I haven\u2019t got a budget. I\u2019m a legislator, but it\u2019s hard to legislate when my party\u2019s out of power. I can convene and knock heads together, I have some influence and can speak to the media. So I\u2019m doing what I can do. But I have no pocket of cash.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier that morning, Lammy, had <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43653291\">broadcast his bewilderment on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme</a> that neither the home secretary nor the mayor had taken the trouble to phone him, when four of his constituents had been murdered. Unsurprisingly, both offices get in touch before the end of the day, but why it took them so long perplexes Lammy. \u201cSadiq and I have a good relationship,\u201d he says, but the only reason he can think of to explain why Khan didn\u2019t call is also his greatest fear: \u201cI think it\u2019s that we\u2019ve come to normalise it. We think of gun and knife crime among teenagers as normal. And it is not.\u201d</p> <p>To Lammy, the rise in London murders feels ominously different to previous surges of violence. \u201cI am more worried about this spike because the profile of the people getting caught up in it is younger. The callousness of shooting into a crowd outside a cinema, shooting at young women, the normalisation \u2013 never mind the ramping up by social media \u2013 all of that makes me alarmed and worried. I am pretty confident that we\u2019re not going to get over this problem unless there is a proper political consensus. This is not going to self-correct.\u201d</p> <p>What does Lammy say to people who hold inadequate or dysfunctional parents entirely to blame? His face screws up in disgust.</p> <p>\u201cIf any of my children picked up a knife or a gun, I would be horrified. I would feel I had failed. But you know, I\u2019ve got resources and means to pay for stuff when my wife and I are at work, and to keep my kids busy. The middle classes use boarding schools and all sorts of clubs, and can bus their kids from X to Y. They have got cars. Their children aren\u2019t having to navigate spaces on their own. So I\u2019m just saying, of course it comes back to parents and moral choices. Of course it takes Mum and Dad, but it also takes a village. And it has to take you paying your taxes to \u2013 \u201d. He falters, on the verge of breaking down. \u201cI\u2019m getting emotional because I am tired,\u201d he says, but looks wholly unembarrassed. \u201cIt has to take you paying your taxes to pay for youth services, to pay for support for the more vulnerable in society. There is no way you can expect that single mother to do it all on her own.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/video/2011/nov/17/london-riots-david-lammy-out-of-the-ashe-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/33ega\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"1664020\"            data-video-name=\"London riots: David Lammy, the MP in the middle, speaks out  - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-381978117\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2011/11/17/111117DavidLammy-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2011/11/17/111117DavidLammy_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2011/11/17/111117DavidLammy_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/111117DavidLammy/111117DavidLammy.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/video/2011/nov/17/london-riots-david-lammy-out-of-the-ashe-video\">London riots: David Lammy, the MP in the middle, speaks out</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>If he had to identify the single biggest cause of the violence, would it be austerity? Six seconds of silence fall, before he replies unhappily: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the cliched Labour politician who says that it is all down to cuts. I really don\u2019t want to be that. But I think we have to be clear: neighbourhood policing has vanished. It\u2019s gone. Then if you also take out 40% from the local authority and you cut youth services, you do effectively leave communities to their own devices.\u201d Does he agree with Met police commissioner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/31/met-commissioner-says-social-media-is-behind-soaring-rate-of-knife\">Cressida Dick that social media also plays a major part</a>? \u201cI think it\u2019s a big influence,\u201d he nods. \u201cSome of this comes back to pride, ego, respect. I see the way in which slights turn into: \u2018I\u2019m going to go and kill you.\u2019 But the truth is,\u201d he adds, that \u201cwe are living in a world in which presidents of countries are living in this way. Why do we think that\u2019s not going to affect young people, who are vulnerable and suggestible, to take that to a different conclusion? That\u2019s what\u2019s going on, yes.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m puzzled by Lammy\u2019s failure, under four successive Labour leaders, to secure his position on the frontbenches, so ask if he can explain it. With a pointed stare, \u201cNo,\u201d he says flatly. \u201cGo and ask the white men who run my party. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say.\u201d I say that sounds like an eloquent answer. \u201cGo and ask them. Go and ask them,\u201d he says testily. \u201cDon\u2019t come to me and ask me why I haven\u2019t been chosen. Ask them about who they\u2019ve chosen.\u201d</p> <p>Lammy nominated Jeremy Corbyn in the leadership election, so I ask if this was because he wanted Corbyn to become leader. \u201cNo. I nominated him because I\u2019m his friend.\u201d Why he isn\u2019t a key player in Corbyn\u2019s inner circle seems confusing, but when I say this, he looks cross. \u201cYou know what? You know what? I\u2019m so bored of tribal politics. That\u2019s part of the problem.\u201d His voice rising, he repeats: \u201cI\u2019m so bored of it. I\u2019m not a tribalist. That\u2019s not what turns me on. So if I don\u2019t present sufficiently as part of the clique, then so be it. I am very happy influencing change in the way I\u2019m influencing change. I have long given up crawling up political backsides in order to float to the top.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/05/london-teenager-fatally-stabbed-named-as-israel-ogunsola\">London teenager fatally stabbed named as Israel Ogunsola</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We\u2019re winding up, about to say goodbye, when I remember one last question. Lammy tweeted a eulogy of unequivocal praise for Winnie Mandela, after her death this week, and I wondered \u2013 in view of the violence in Tottenham \u2013 if he was at all worried that it might be read as a tacit message that violence is a forgivable, perhaps even legitimate, response to racial oppression. He stares at me in silence for around eight seconds, and his eyes begin to redden and well.</p> <p>\u201cI tweeted about Winnie Mandela,\u201d he begins, his voice cracking, \u201cbecause I remember being 13 or 14, growing up in this constituency\u201d \u2013 the voice falters again \u2013 \u201cwith <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/03/thatcher-mandela-release\">Margaret Thatcher doing deals with Botha</a>, and not pursuing sanctions. Riots, Nelson Mandela in prison.\u201d Tears begin streaming down his cheeks. \u201cAnd she was our hero.\u201d He pauses to steady his voice. \u201cNo one is perfect, and I have not had to put up with the humiliations, the tortures, the nightmare of your husband being in prison for 27 years. She has died, and I know enough South Africans to know that for them, Winnie Mandela is a hero. And I stand with them.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be cowed by the rampant racism, the organised racism, that comes from parts of the alt-right.\u201d His voice rises as his anger swells. \u201cThat seeks to put down every single tweet I make. I\u2019m standing with Winnie. And I don\u2019t give a damn. It\u2019s as simple as that. I\u2019m not running in the opposite direction. That\u2019s why I tweeted. This is where I\u2019m from.\u201d He bangs the table. \u201cI grew up just a few roads away. This is where I\u2019m from. I speak for the people I represent. And we are proud of Winnie Mandela \u2013 faults and all. We look around at our national politicians, we do not see national politicians who are without fault. And, actually, we see quite a lot who get very far \u2013 let\u2019s take Boris Johnson \u2013 with,\u201d and through his tears he spits out the words: \u201cConsiderable. White. Privilege. Failure after failure after failure rewarded. So don\u2019t preach to me about Winnie Mandela.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 April.

     "body": "<p>Expecting radical action from an awards ceremony is like expecting the weather forecast to rearrange the skies. These events reinforce cultural norms rather than setting them, even if institutions such as the Oscars and Golden Globes are trying to reinvent themselves in the aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/harvey-weinstein\">Harvey Weinstein</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a>. But rarely has that culture of affirmation been more apparent than at this year\u2019s Grammys, which rode numerous political moments without contributing to or rewarding them.</p> \n<p>The Grammys\u2019 60th year boasted two advance headlines. One was that hip-hop might finally get its dues at the ceremony. The first hip-hop record to win the album of the year category was Lauryn Hill\u2019s The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill in 1999; the second, and latest, was Outkast\u2019s Speakerboxxx/The Love Below in 2004. This year marked the rare occasion when no white men were up for the award, populated instead by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/24/bruno-mars-24k-magic-review-barry-manilow-atlantic\">Bruno Mars\u2019 24K Magic</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/01/childish-gambino-awaken-my-love-album-review-funk-donald-glover\">Childish Gambino\u2019s Awaken, My Love</a>!, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/30/jay-z-444-review\">Jay-Z\u2019s 4:44</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/14/kendrick-lamar-damn-review\">Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Damn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/16/lorde-melodrama-review-cocky-challenge-pop-rivals\">Lorde\u2019s Melodrama</a>. Yet Mars won with his third album of cosy funk and R&amp;B. His acceptance speech nodded to its retro influences \u2013 80s and 90s stars Babyface, Teddy Riley, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/22/janet-jackson-superproducers-jimmy-jam-and-terry-lewis\">Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis</a> \u2013 putting him in stark contrast with his more progressive, political competitors.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere in hip-hop, Jay-Z received the most nominations of any artist, with eight nods for 4:44, but won no awards. Lamar won in the rap categories for album, song, performance and collaboration, but lost in the top-billing general slots for album, video and record. The Grammys\u2019 failure to recognise hip-hop undermines its flashy overtures to the genre, and fails to reflect its status as the <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8085975/us-music-consumption-up-2017-rb-hip-hop-most-popular-genre\">most popular genre</a> in the US.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7ee737b8-4afa-43fa-b69a-2125dbcc6848\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/43Tr8g2c6mw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The ceremony\u2019s other advance headline was that this year\u2019s Grammys might provide music\u2019s inexplicably overdue \u201c#MeToo moment\u201d. Following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/jan/08/dress-it-black-fashions-response-to-the-post-weinstein\">campaign</a> for Golden Globes nominees to wear black in solidarity with victims of sexual violence, a group of female major-label employees under the name Voices in Entertainment suggested that attendees wear a white rose as a symbol of \u201chope, peace, sympathy and resistance\u201d. Host <a href=\"http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/US-James-Corden-Grammy/777d2ee44f5a805728c4a8c4decb44a8\">James Corden</a> said he thought it would be \u201ca moving moment\u201d. The Recording Academy had also booked Kesha to perform her song Praying \u2013 implicitly understood to reference her allegations of sexual and physical abuse against former producer Dr Luke \u2013 as a way of recognising the ongoing cultural dialogue.</p> \n<p>Kesha\u2019s performance was wrenching. Backed by a choir including Camila Cabello, Cyndi Lauper and Julia Michaels, she cried in her collaborators\u2019 arms after the final note. Yet it also felt exploitative on the Grammys\u2019 part.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/06/judge-dismisses-keshas-sexual-assault-case-against-producer-dr-luke\"> Kesha lost her case against Dr Luke</a>, who is now suing her for defamation, and she cannot discuss the case directly; the Grammys put the burden of representing a new era of zero tolerance in entertainment on a woman who remains trapped in its grey areas.</p> \n<p>This hypocrisy was further entrenched by the awards\u2019 failure to recognise women. Out of 86 categories, only 17 were handed to women, or female-fronted bands. The televised ceremony only featured one female winner, Alessia Cara for best new artist. Lorde was the only album of the year nominee who wasn\u2019t asked to perform solo, but reportedly was invited to join a tribute to the late Tom Petty, which she allegedly declined. \u201cWe have a box and it gets full,\u201d Grammys producer <a href=\"http://variety.com/2018/music/news/grammys-so-male-women-recording-academy-president-neil-portnow-1202679902/\">Ken Ehrlich</a> said of the snub. \u201cShe had a great album. There\u2019s no way we can really deal with everybody.\u201d And yet, Sting and Shaggy \u2013 <em>Sting and Shaggy</em> \u2013 performed two \u2013 <em>two!</em> \u2013 songs from their forthcoming collaborative album.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"988814fc-9005-4258-a053-b9900fa6c1b6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xoJM7sdxfPI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>After the ceremony, Variety asked Recording Academy president <a href=\"http://variety.com/2018/music/news/grammys-so-male-women-recording-academy-president-neil-portnow-1202679902/\">Neil Portnow</a> about the #GrammysSoMale hashtag circulating throughout the broadcast. He put the onus of change on women \u201cwho have the creativity in their hearts and souls, who want to be musicians, who want to be engineers, producers, and want to be part of the industry on the executive level \u2026 [They need] to step up because I think they would be welcome. I don\u2019t have personal experience of those kinds of brick walls that you face, but I think it\u2019s upon us \u2013 us as an industry \u2013 to make the welcome mat very obvious, breeding opportunities for all people who want to be creative and paying it forward and creating that next generation of artists.\u201d</p> \n<p>Few things leave a bad taste like powerful men undermining their immense influence to suggest that it\u2019s up to marginalised groups to better their own fortunes, wilfully ignoring the systemic barriers that women, people of colour and the LGBTQ community face when navigating any establishment. Just last week, a number of reports were published confirming music\u2019s gender inequality issue. A <a href=\"https://news.usc.edu/135288/in-music-industry-female-songwriters-and-producesr-are-outnumbered-by-men/\">study</a> by the University of Southern California analysed 600 songs from the Billboard Hot 100 between 2012 and 2017, finding that women accounted for just 22.4% of artists and 12.3% of all songwriting credits. It also found that women comprised just 9% of Grammy nominees from the past six years. Billboard published its <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8096144/billboard-2018-power-100-list\">2018 Power List</a>, ranking the most influential people in the music industry. Universal Music Publishing\u2019s Jody Gerson was the only standalone woman in the top 25 (four other women shared billing with male colleagues).</p> \n<p>Never mind the Recording Academy\u2019s hopes of kickstarting music\u2019s #MeToo moment; by systemically underrepresenting women\u2019s achievements and contributing to a lack of female visibility, they\u2019re helping to entrench its absence. There is a direct correlation between a lack of opportunity for women in music and the underreporting of abuse that is a widely acknowledged failure of the industry. When men such as Portnow admit to not having \u201cpersonal experience of those kinds of brick walls that you face\u201d, how can they know where change needs to happen? When men predominantly occupy positions of power, and a woman has been exploited by a powerful man, who can she trust with her allegations? Unrelated to the Grammys, I was struck by DJ Annie Mac\u2019s comments in a recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/musicblog/live/2017/nov/27/annie-mac-webchat-post-your-questions-now\">Guardian webchat</a> when asked if she could name \u201cthree male allies\u201d to women\u2019s rights in the music industry. \u201cI have been racking my brains and the answer is no,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot name a man who is publicly pushing forwards women\u2019s rights and making a point of appointing women.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BehB27UHojJ/\" data-instgrm-version=\"8\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\">\n  <div style=\"padding:8px;\"> \n   <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> \n    <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div>\n   </div> \n   <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BehB27UHojJ/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">My version of a white rose \u2014 THE APOCALYPSE WILL BLOSSOM \u2014 an excerpt from the greatest of all time, jenny holzer \ud83d\udd4a\ud83c\udf39</a></p> \n   <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lordemusic/\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Lorde</a> (@lordemusic) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2018-01-29T02:09:15+00:00\">Jan 28, 2018 at 6:09pm PST</time></p>\n  </div>\n </blockquote> \n <script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script> \n</figure> \n<p>There have been many conversations in recent weeks about whether entertainment and symbolic protests can constitute activism. Many of the performances on the Grammys\u2019 stage last night felt like arguments in its favour: Kendrick Lamar\u2019s radically black work, Kesha\u2019s liberationist balladry, and Alessia Cara, Logic and Khalid\u2019s anti-suicide anthem 1-800-273-8255. These displays have provided a necessary image rehabilitation for the Grammys, long dogged by accusations of irrelevance. But image is all it is until the members of the Recording Academy reflect this aesthetic change in their list of winners. Their time to do so is running out.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/28/grammys-2018-bruno-mars-wins-kesha-metoo-timesup-performance\">Bruno Mars wins big at Grammys 2018 while Kesha's #MeToo performance soars</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Rather than wear a white rose, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BehB27UHojJ/\">Lorde pinned</a> an edited version of feminist artist Jenny Holzer\u2019s \u201cTHE APOCALYPSE WILL BLOSSOM\u201d manifesto to the back of her dress. She left off the line, \u201cdo not support palliative gestures\u201d, perhaps aware that her placard could be read as one when she still turned up (albeit defiantly swigging from a hip flask). But it was one of several signs of unrest coming from inside Madison Square Garden last night. Lorde\u2019s statement was obviously in reference to the reckoning awaiting the entertainment industry\u2019s exploiters, as was Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s introduction to Kesha\u2019s performance. Both contained subtle messages for the Recording Academy. \u201cJust as we have the power to shape culture, we also have the power to undo the culture that does not serve us,\u201d Mon\u00e1e said.</p> \n<p>More and more artists aren\u2019t bothering with the event at all. Drake declined to submit anything from his 2017 \u201cplaylist\u201d More Life for the Grammys\u2019 consideration; Frank Ocean similarly withheld music from his 2016 releases Blonde and Endless, telling the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/arts/music/frank-ocean-blonde-interview.html\">New York Times</a>: \u201cThat institution certainly has nostalgic importance. It just doesn\u2019t seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down.\u201d By glomming on to the flattering aesthetic of protest, the Grammys has made itself a target. </p>"

It has provided a perfect opportunity for community program practitioners, activists and advocacy groups to come together, form stronger alliances and both expose and progress broader public understanding of the complex of race-related (and gender-related) disadvantage and discrimination in this country. These firmer connective networks can and will contribute to delivering a more participatory form of democracy than Australia is used to.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/02/black-lives-matter-in-australia-wherever-black-people-are-there-is-racism-and-resistance\">Black Lives Matter in Australia: wherever black people are, there is racism \u2013 and resistance</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Last Friday I met Patrisse Cullors and Rodney Diverlus from Black Lives Matter at Melbourne\u2019s Tullamarine airport and flew to Mildura to hear from local mob there about community efforts to improve issues such as family violence and overrepresentation in the justice system. The objective of the trip was for IndigenousX to provide Black Lives Matter with an understanding of what is happening on the ground in Indigenous communities, outside the inner-city metropolitan areas that their itinerary had otherwise confined them to. </p> \n<p>In Mildura we gave them a glimpse of the potential of community-led programs so they could take that knowledge with them into a week packed with media appearances and meetings. Cullors and Diverlus also heard from community about their lived experiences, past and present, to provide them with a better understanding of the persistent issues impacting Indigenous communities more broadly.</p> \n<p>Together we heard from elders and respected community leaders about the role they play within Victoria\u2019s Koori court and how that program aims to reduce recidivism and overrepresentation within the state\u2019s justice system. </p> \n<p>We visited the <a href=\"http://www.havenreports.com.au/our-highlights/meminar-ngnang-gimba/\">Meminar Ngangg Gimba women\u2019s shelter</a> and listened to the elders who work there around the clock to assist families escaping domestic violence. We sat with representatives of the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service and heard what it\u2019s like growing up in Mildura and the state of relationships between the region\u2019s Indigenous youth and police. These conversations, as well as others with different community members, revealed a common thread: self-determined programs that provide Indigenous decision-making roles work better than those not being led by mob.</p> \n<p>The cruel irony of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/26/turnbulls-uluru-statement-rejection-mean-spirited-bastardry-legal-expert\">Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s flat rejection of the Uluru statement\u2019s</a> proposition for a constitutionally enshrined Indigenous voice to parliament hung absurdly and deplorably over each of these exchanges.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2cebf40a-b1ae-4761-92c0-bbc22cf53c2b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div> \n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iAVymi5p694?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Driving back into town after listening to that Murriwarra elder Aunty Margrett Handy-Mitchell recount her experiences growing up in the region, Guardian Australia\u2019s videographer David Fanner asked Cullors and Diverlus if they understood what was meant when Aunty Margrett told them that as a child she used to find her shoes at the \u201ctip\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s only one generation back,\u201d Fanner said in amazement. We were following Uncle Peter Peterson towards Dareton\u2019s Namatjira mission. \u201cNama\u201d, as locals refer to it, is an Aboriginal settlement established in 1968 to wipe out the multiple shanty towns that surrounded Mildura. Nama had electricity and water connected in 1992.</p> \n<p>During our time in Mildura, and briefly in the video we produced, Cullors and Diverlus explained their perspectives of the black diaspora to me. It was a tale of urgent inequality and disadvantage, of black fear and the violent erasure of diverse culture and diverse bodies. First Nations peoples in this country haven\u2019t escaped that conceptualisation of diaspora either. In fact it\u2019s an ongoing project. The dispersals perpetrated on our old ones during the frontier wars, and again notably in the first half of last century under the banner of the assimilationist white Australia policy, have simply been working more quietly, more insidiously recently. Here too, the state-willed erasure persists unabated.</p> \n<p>The bestowing of the Sydney peace prize on the Black Lives Matter movement shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as ignoring any of our domestic race-related human rights issues. It has provided a space to amplify these issues into dominant forums, but more importantly, it has presented the opportunity to draw together and form stronger strategic alliances across our diverse advocacy groups, to form a collective to push back against the commonwealth\u2019s ongoing colonial project, to form a network of resistance operating on many fronts simultaneously. </p>"

Authorities were targeting him for promoting black-led community groups and fighting \u201cgovernment abuse\u201d, he wrote, adding he was never a threat to anyone: \u201cViolence is the method of our oppressor, our method is hard work, love and unity.\u201d<br></p> <p>When he was arrested, police confiscated his .38-caliber handgun and an unloaded AK-style assault rifle \u2013 and also, he said, took his book Negroes with Guns by the civil rights leader Robert F Williams. </p> <p>\u201cThey were really desperate,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cThis is pretty much like Stalin 1950 \u2013 \u2018You show me the man.

The officer has already expressed remorse and is very apologetic over his comments.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe expect the highest standards of behaviour from all our officers and staff, and we will always take complaints from members of the public seriously.\u201d</p> \n<p>The footage starts by showing officers talking to a man, named locally as Jack Chambers, 24, who is sitting down and smoking.</p> \n<p>One officer asks Chambers why he did not open the door to let the police in, to which he replies: \u201cBecause I was fucking half asleep ... I didn\u2019t know who you was and you were climbing up the window like thieves.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chambers then says: \u201cPolice? That\u2019s even worse. I\u2019ve been seeing all kinds of videos, I have.\u201d</p> \n<p>One officer is then heard to say: \u201cYou\u2019re going to go Black Lives Matter on us, are ya?\u201d Chambers replies: \u201cYeah\u201d and laughter is heard. The officer then responds: \u201cYou would be the first one I would shoot if I had a gun, definitely.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chambers replies: \u201cOh, fucking hell.\u201d The officer appears unaware that the exchange is being recorded.</p> \n<p>Desmond Jaddoo, a Birmingham-based community activist, called for the officer to be removed from duty. He said: \u201cMy concern as an activist is, taking into account the current climate and deaths in custody and also community relations, this goes no way in building trust and confidence with the police.</p> \n<p>\u201cI would also say, I see this not being a hate crime but other criminality. As far as I\u2019m concerned these are serious matters. Police officers are there to set an example. Their behaviour must be beyond reproach.<br></p> \n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t not make flippant statements about serious issues which affect communities. This is not locker room banter.\u201d </p>"

     "body": "<p>Of the many remarkable moments on our Australian trip so far, there\u2019s one that stands out. </p> \n<p>On Tuesday night, we visited the Redfern community centre to meet with local Indigenous people and hear their stories. </p> \n<p>After playing the didgeridoo, Nathan Scott stood up, opened up his notebook and read out his father\u2019s story. He was only six months old when <a href=\"http://treatyrepublic.net/content/three-decades-death-douglas-scott-remains-unresolved\">his father Douglas Scott</a> was found hanged in his cell in Berrimah prison in Darwin. The family was told he had killed himself, but Nathan\u2019s mother refused to believe this. For 20 years, his mother fought for justice for his father, but she never found it. The police harassed and surveilled the family when they asked questions, but there were no answers.</p> \n<p>And yet, although the family never received justice and it was a great sacrifice for everyone involved, Nathan Scott said he wouldn\u2019t have done anything differently. For him, his fight for his father was a fight for all Indigenous Australian people.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2cebf40a-b1ae-4761-92c0-bbc22cf53c2b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div> \n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iAVymi5p694?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As a co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a>, this was powerful because people often say to us, it\u2019s been four years and police are still killing black people, do you think your movement has failed? My answer is always the same: this has just begun. There is a long road to undo colonialism and racism. It is going to be a long road to achieve the things that we want but it doesn\u2019t mean you stop, it doesn\u2019t mean you give up.</p> \n<p>When we started<a href=\"https://blacklivesmatter.com/\"> Black Lives Matter</a>, we understood that this movement wasn\u2019t just for the United States but one that could centre black communities around the globe. We don\u2019t see this as a civil rights movement, we don\u2019t see this as relegated to the United States but as a human rights movement which allows us to have a broader conversation about anti-black racism across the globe. <br></p> \n<p>So we have travelled to the UK, through the Americas, to Palestine and now to Australia. Throughout our travels we have seen that black people and Indigenous people are suffering, and, despite that suffering, local governments aren\u2019t standing up for us. Wherever black people are, there is racism and the impacts of racism. Yet wherever black people are, there is resistance. We are still resisting and we are still calling for new ways of relating to us, we\u2019re still calling for care and for dignity.</p> \n<p>Black Lives Matter is in Australia to accept the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/23/black-lives-matter-awarded-2017-sydney-peace-prize\">Sydney peace prize</a>, and meet with black Australians. During our trip, the thing that stands out to us most is that Indigenous Australians are facing some of the most horrendous living conditions in the world, sadly similar conditions to those in the US and Canada. Black Lives Matter is pertinent here in Australia and as we have conversations with people, we are realising that.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2017/may/23/black-lives-matter-were-trying-to-re-imagine-humanity-behind-the-lines-podcast\">Black Lives Matter: 'We're trying to re-imagine humanity' \u2013 Behind the Lines podcast</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>We have heard about the high incarceration rate of Indigenous people and Torres Strait Islanders. We have heard about the impact that colonialism has had on the family unit and how this has contributed to family violence. We\u2019ve heard about the deaths in custody, and the families who have lost their children held in custody. Many of these family members are calling these murders, because when they are finally able to see their children, they were bruised and battered, with broken bones. </p> \n<p>Local government must hold law enforcement accountable for these atrocities. The government can no longer be silent, it must stand on the side of the original people of this land, and challenge the idea that their lives don\u2019t matter. </p> \n<p>In the long term, the only way to change the living conditions of Indigenous communities is through divestment \u2013 and then reinvestment. Over the years, local governments have completely divested from caring for our communities, so we are calling for a reinvestment in black and Indigenous communities. We\u2019re calling for divestment from resourcing agencies and local public agencies that cause harm and violence to our communities. </p> \n<p>What makes our communities safe is for us to have access to healthy food, to feed our communities, to access jobs, and to be able to access public education. This can be achieved through reinvestment in Indigenous communities.</p> \n<p>This is a long term struggle against racism. We stand on the shoulders of giants, of black leaders from across the globe, who have put their lives on the line to fight for not just the survival of black people but the thriving of black people. </p> \n<p>We see our work as part of a much needed resurgence of a human rights movements in our country, in the US, but also abroad. We are not the first ones to do this, we know we are not going to be the last, we are part of a legacy of freedom fighters.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/23/black-lives-matter-awarded-2017-sydney-peace-prize\">Black Lives Matter awarded 2017 Sydney peace prize</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And while there is heartbreak, there is also hope. I am never numb to the impact racism has on my communities across the world. As I listened to the families that shared their stories on Tuesday at the Redfern community centre, I cried because that could be my family, that has been my family, and so my heart is with the Indigenous people of Australia.</p> \n<p>But there is a growing desire for a broad base movement for Indigenous communities across the country. There is a desire to have a conversation in Australia that doesn\u2019t end with talking but that really catapults a new practice in how this country relates to its original people. That is really inspiring. It\u2019s inspiring to talk about how we\u2019ve changed the landscape for our communities in the US and in Canada, and what might be possible here in this country. And this gives me hope.</p> \n<p><em>The Black Lives Matter Global Network is in Australia to receive the Sydney Peace Prize.

It\u2019s a notion that infuriated Salman Rushdie, who wrote a strident essay for the <em>Guardian</em> in which he claimed the film-makers, too wedded to avant-garde hermeticism, had spurned the opportunity to offer a loudspeaker to marginalised immigrants. He was on the side of a dominant style of journalism in which reporters race to burning neighbourhoods to track down and interview locals who can explain, preferably in outraged sentences, why people are angry, who is to blame for the mess, and what will happen if things don\u2019t change.</p> <p><em>They Can\u2019t Kill Us All</em> is Wesley Lowery\u2019s memoir, compiled from the <em>Washington Post</em> reporter\u2019s \u201cmessy notes\u201d, which aspires to tell the story of Ferguson, Missouri where, in August 2014, weeks of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/16/ferguson-police-michael-brown-protesters\">protest and rioting</a> broke out in the aftermath of the shooting of an unarmed black American, Michael Brown, by white police officer Darren Wilson. Its author came to public attention when he became the first journalist to be imprisoned \u2013 albeit for barely 20 minutes \u2013 for covering the arrest. He later played a key role in the <em>Post</em>\u2019s Pulitzer prize-winning \u201cfatal force\u201d project, a database that, in the absence of comprehensive federal government data, assembled information on police shootings in 2015.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He excels in his evocation of story gathering in the digital age , where a hashtag can be as galvanising as a photograph</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What was Ferguson? It\u2019s a name, a kind of brand, a fuzzy signifier. For Lowery, \u201cthere are no isolated incidents, yet the media\u2019s focus on the victim and the officer inadvertently erases the context of the nation\u2019s history as it relates race, policing, and training for law enforcements\u201d. While conservative pundits, often with barely suppressed glee, used it as a byword for dysfunction, many black men and women hauled it into a much longer history of racial terror within America. Did it give birth to the \u201csocial movement\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a>? If it didn\u2019t kickstart, it certainly intensified a national \u2013 and perhaps even international \u2013 debate about whether Barack Obama\u2019s presidency had really ushered in a post-racial era.</p> <p>The people Lowery encounters come across as soundbite sources rather than fully fleshed-out individuals. Although he spends more time hanging out in the communities he\u2019s reporting on than many of his colleagues, the character and texture of those neighbourhoods are missing. His medium-roast prose \u2013 \u201cKnowing that a police officer is responsible causes a special, deep pain for the families of those who killed\u201d \u2013 can\u2019t compare with the lyricism of Jesmyn Ward\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/men-we-reaped.html\"><em>Men We Reaped</em></a> (2014) or the caustic heft of Gary Younge\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/26/another-day-in-the-death-america-gary-younge-review\"><em>Another Day in the Death of America</em></a> (2016).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/26/another-day-in-the-death-america-gary-younge-review\">Another Day in the Death of America by Gary Younge \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Where he excels is in his evocation of story gathering in the digital age.

The last series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/04/scandal-review-kerry-washington-white-house-olivia\">Scandal</a> improved on reality with \u2013 spoilers ahead \u2013 a frankly fantastical ending in which the racist officer was prosecuted and anti-corruption legislation was introduced. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/05/the-good-wife-final-season-julianna-margulies-cbs\">The Good Wife</a> wasn\u2019t so much criticised as pitied for a cringingly tone-deaf episode in which two wealthy white characters debated racial injustice in a hotel kitchen, surrounded by mostly black staff who later broke into applause. Law &amp; Order characteristically used it as another \u201cripped from the headlines\u201d plot. Shots Fired is palpably something different.</p> <p>\u201cIt was extremely emotional for all of us,\u201d recalls Wilds who, prior to being cast as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQHsXMglC9A\">Adele\u2019s love interest in her Hello video</a>, was best known in the UK as Michael the soft-spoken corner boy from The Wire. \u201cOn other sets, you can go home, decompress, watch cartoons or whatever, to just take your mind off it. The greatest and the worst part with this was you turn on your television, you open your phone up and you see another kid shot. You see another police officer getting off; you see another incident and another incident and another incident, damn near every day.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2016/sep/15/black-panthers-black-lives-matter-gallery-stephen-shames-pictures\">From Black Panthers to Black Lives Matter \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8abe592dcafaabe791d4ffc3de2d253ea9de6eb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8abe592dcafaabe791d4ffc3de2d253ea9de6eb2/0_0_2126_1275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sanaa Lathan as Ashe Akino in Shots Fired\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Line of duty ... Sanaa Lathan as Ashe Akino in Shots Fired.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Motion Picture/Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lathan who plays investigator Ashe Akino, describes a similar on-set experience: \u201cAfter Philando got killed, we came in the next day and our first AD [assistant director] was in tears. We did kind of a prayer circle because it was just too close to home.\u201d She says it was coming to understand acting as a kind of activism that kept the cast going. \u201cWe want to entertain people, and it is very entertaining, but we also want to inspire people to address the issue.\u201d</p> <p>Yet cop dramas and police procedurals are not traditionally the locus of fiery, thought-provoking challenges to the status quo. In fact, several studies suggest that genre viewers are more likely to have positive attitudes towards the police, as well as supporting punitive policies such as capital punishment. And since the majority of people have little personal contact with the criminal justice system in their daily lives, these dramas can become a key source of public \u201cinformation\u201d. Kathleen Donovan, a political science professor at St John Fisher College, New York and researcher in this field, perceives an anti-civil liberties message in most cop shows. \u201c[On TV] the typical criminal is a bad person who very consciously and deliberately decides to commit crime,\u201d she says. \u201cThe typical cop is \u2018married to the job\u2019 and though he or she may need to break a few rules from time to time, the ends justify the means because they are the \u2018good guys\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The mechanism for delivering this message is not so blatant as the straightforward racial stereotyping of young black men \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/01/03/the-surprising-racial-and-gender-bias-in-law-and-order/?utm_term=.a50f80d4f18d\">a recent study of Law &amp; Order found that the show actually over-represents whites and females as both victims and perpetrators</a> \u2013 but this may also be a part of the problem. \u201cIn an effort to be unbiased and post-racial, there is a tendency to focus on the crime and the process of solving it, with little consideration of the social factors involved,\u201d says Alex Vitale, author of forthcoming book <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/2426-the-end-of-policing\">The End of Policing</a>. \u201cIn fact, the history of crime, police, courts and prisons is a history of race relations. By glossing over that history, [police dramas] perpetuate the illusion that racism is not at the centre of American social relations.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/27/baltimore-15-years-after-the-wire\">\u2018Progress is painfully uneven\u2019: Baltimore, 15 years after The Wire</a> </p> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a6715655cbccd96daec8a369d253036ac5a0370\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a6715655cbccd96daec8a369d253036ac5a0370/0_71_2126_1275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tristan Mack Wilds as Deputy Joshua Beck in Shots Fired\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On patrol ... Tristan Mack Wilds as Deputy Joshua Beck in Shots Fired.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Motion Picture/Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So while the real-world racial bias of the criminal justice system is well documented (black Americans are no more likely than white Americans to use or sell drugs, but are arrested at twice the rate, to give one example), the criminal justice system, as seen on television, is devoid of all such context. No doubt the reasons why juries nearly always acquit in cases of police-involved shootings are complex, but it seems likely that the TV-promoted image of the always-benevolent copper might have something to do with it.</p> <p>What would a radical, change-promoting police procedural look like? Probably a lot like Shots Fired, which not only features a range of prominent non-white characters but crucially also challenges the liberal erasure of race, gender and class by fully exploring how these characters\u2019 backgrounds impact on their experience. So, Lathan\u2019s Ashe Akino is not a law-enforcement agent who just happens to be a black women; she\u2019s a law-enforcement agent whose experience of systemic discrimination has forced her to develop a finesse in dealing with people in positions of power that her male, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League\">Ivy League</a>-educated partner lacks.</p> <p>\u201cI love that whole paradigm shift with the partners,\u201d says Lathan. \u201cYou usually see two men, and with this being a woman and a man and the woman being the older one, it\u2019s new. She the veteran and he\u2019s the green one.\u201d In many ways, Akino is the closest Shots Fired gets to that old TV staple, the \u201cmaverick cop\u201d. She\u2019s got the troubled home life, the low-level drinking problem and the passion for justice, but she can\u2019t afford to cut corners in quite the same way that white men such as The Wire\u2019s McNulty or The Shield\u2019s Vic Mackey do. It\u2019s a subtle subversion which reminds us of the ways in which privilege works, both in criminal justice and TV representation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c11aec3640ec673aa43eb634f959251d8efd4f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c11aec3640ec673aa43eb634f959251d8efd4f5/0_15_2126_1275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Hunt as Governor Patricia Eamons in Shots Fired\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carolina scheming ... Helen Hunt as Governor Patricia Eamons in Shots Fired.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Motion Picture/Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of Shots Fired\u2019s viewers will need no reminding, however, as Wilds points out. \u201cI think there\u2019s enough going on in our communities where no matter how many cop shows we see, it\u2019s not gonna change the way that we feel just walking outside,\u201d he says. He was raised in a \u201cpretty poor neighbourhood\u201d in New York, at the height of the stop-and-frisk era. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve definitely had my own run-ins with police officers. It had me grow up with the mindset of not necessarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/14/nwa-straight-outta-compton-mainstream\">NWA</a> the police, but very, very close to it, y\u2019know?\u201d</p> <p>As well as literally stepping into a policeman\u2019s shoes to play Officer Beck, Wilds\u2019s research involved spending time with real officers, observing their work and hearing their points of view. Did it make him feel more sympathetic? \u201cI don\u2019t want to say \u2018sympathetic\u2019. I think it\u2019s more of just an understanding thing. I don\u2019t condone anything that these police officers are doing out here; it\u2019s ugly, it\u2019s disgusting, but I come from a place now of understanding their training and understanding a lot of police officers\u2019 mindsets.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s this same kind of understanding-not-sympathy that Shots Fired affords all its viewers. It\u2019s also this exploration of several perspectives \u2013 black, white, male, female, rich, poor, police, civilian \u2013 that means it could never be simply Black Lives Matter: The Show. \u201cAs much as I would want to say that it is, I can\u2019t,\u201d says Wilds. \u201cI am very much pro-Black Lives Matter, but this is a show that\u2019s for all of us, not just one race, not just one person. This is for us all to look at each other and understand that we\u2019re all human in this.\u201d</p> <p><em>Shots Fired continues 23 July, 9pm, Fox</em></p>"

What is happening to that person\u2019s life \u2013 their body, their dreams, their finances, their mental health \u2013 is, for a campaign seemingly more intent on oppressing women than liberating them, nothing more than a word association game meant to draw a provocative parallel with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">real struggle for civil rights</a>.</p> <p>Playing on Black Lives Matter is not just cynical, it\u2019s offensive.

The concept of reproductive rights and reproductive justice, which goes far beyond the simple right to choose whether or not to continue with a pregnancy, is integral to Black Lives Matter, because it also means the right to parent your child in a safe environment without fear \u2013 something consistently denied to black families by police and institutional injustice.</p> <p>Defined by the <a href=\"http://sistersong.net/reproductive-justice/\">Sister Song Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective</a> as \u201cthe human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities,\u201d reproductive justice as a concept was developed by women of colour who saw many of their communities challenged not just by an absence of accessible abortion, but by poverty, racism and discrimination.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/01/northern-ireland-theresa-may-dup-deal-government-abortion-women-gay-rights\">Fertile and straight?

     "body": "<p>Spain is in crisis, and its prime minister appears to be in denial. The run-up to Sunday\u2019s referendum on independence for Catalonia made it clear that the country was in trouble. But neither those arranging it nor those rejecting it can fully have anticipated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/01/dozens-injured-as-riot-police-storm-catalan-ref-polling-stations\" title=\"\">the scenes at polling stations</a>: police in riot gear beating peaceful protesters with batons, dragging voters out by the hair or throwing them down stairs, firing rubber bullets to disperse crowds \u2013 even striking at Catalan firefighters and jostling with Catalan police.</p> <p>The immediate result of the violence was hundreds of casualties by mid-afternoon, according to Catalan authorities, and at least 11 wounded officers, according to the central government. The wider effect is the shock expressed well beyond Catalonia, and Spain. The outcome is almost certain to be that some of the Catalans indifferent or opposed to&nbsp;secession \u2013 until now, at least, the majority \u2013 are pushed into the arms of the cause. Who&nbsp;wants to be ruled by a state like this, many are asking.</p> <p>Yet Mariano Rajoy\u2019s response, in his address to the nation, was simple: there was no referendum and no problem \u2013 police acted with \u201cfirmness and serenity\u201d. The&nbsp;responsibility for all that had happened lay with the Catalonian government. Spain is paying for his determination to stop the illegal vote by the bluntest means and at all costs. His latest remarks are only likely to inflame matters.</p> <p>Catalan nationalists owe him much of their success in recent years. The Spanish financial crisis fuelled a surge in the independence movement, leaving many in the wealthy region feeling they were paying more than their fair share. But the shift in the public mood was spurred on when the constitutional court trimmed back a charter increasing the region\u2019s powers \u2013 and already approved by the Spanish parliament \u2013 after a&nbsp;challenge by Mr Rajoy\u2019s People\u2019s party.</p> <p>Even so, support for independence peaked in 2013, at an estimated 49%. Catalan nationalists, who hold only a wafer-thin majority in the regional parliament, pushed the legislation for Sunday\u2019s vote through it against considerable opposition; Catalans who wanted to remain in Spain were unlikely to vote. The Spanish constitutional court ruled it illegal and called for it to be halted. But Mr Rajoy\u2019s heavy-handed response furthered the cause of secessionists again.</p> <p>The central government seized 10m ballot&nbsp;papers; arrested key officials; dismantled the technology to connect voting stations, tally votes and vote online; blocked and removed voters from polling stations; and confiscated ballot boxes. Catalan officials told voters to print off ballot papers at home and said they could vote wherever they wanted. Whatever they may claim, the results are neither legally nor morally binding: whatever votes are tallied cannot truly represent Catalonia\u2019s wishes. Between&nbsp;them,&nbsp;the two sides have produced both a vote that is hugely contentious and a&nbsp;result that is meaningless.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s address, made as condemnations of violence arrived from Jeremy Corbyn, the&nbsp;Belgian prime minister and the EU\u2019s Guy Verhofstadt \u2013 though most member states <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/01/catalan-referendum-eu-leaders-remain-muted-over-police-crackdown\" title=\"\">sought to stay out of the affair</a> \u2013 is likely to fuel nationalists\u2019 accusations of authoritarianism and complaints about the suppression of the Catalan will.</p> <p>But if Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont was right to say that the Spanish state had \u201clost much more than what it had already lost\u201d, his assertion that Catalonia had won is at best half true. Most&nbsp;Catalans wished both for a referendum and to remain in a united country. They have&nbsp;been ill-served by both the state and the&nbsp;independence movement. Mr&nbsp;Verhofstadt&nbsp;urged de-escalation, a negotiated solution bringing in all parties \u2013 including the opposition in Catalonia \u2013 and&nbsp;respect for Spain\u2019s constitutional and legal order. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;right. Finding a way out of this mess will&nbsp;require a willingness to listen, to Catalans most of all.</p>"

     "body": "<p>The difficulties faced by recent social movements in achieving positive change, despite their tremendous speed and overwhelming size, is a sign that activism as a discipline must embark on a period of paradigmatic reevaluation. Breaking with the enforced consensus that our movements are winning even when it looks like we\u2019re losing \u2014 that Occupy, Black Lives Matter, Standing Rock, Charlottesville and the countless protests happening worldwide every day are victories despite never achieving their avowed objectives \u2014 is not easy. Challenging the activist orthodoxy as an activist is far more difficult than marching in the streets or sharing rebellious tweets. But the risk of staying silent is too great. Activists must act up to save protest from irrelevance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/14/progressive-patriotism-rebels-revolution-micah-white\">'Real Americans' have always been rebels: a guide for progressive patriotism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The ways activists protest today, both online and in the streets, are ineffective and do not result in the transformative social change that we desire. This realisation is liberatory. It frees us to ask the most important question of all: why are our protests failing?</p> <p>An unfortunate consequence of the lack of critical reflection on protest failure is that the few explanations typically given are wholly insufficient. For example, perhaps the most commonly proposed reason for why Occupy failed is that our movement lacked demands. While it may be true that Occupy lacked a single, unified demand across all of our nearly 1,000 encampments worldwide, this theory is false because it does not explain why protests that have had clearly articulated demands also failed. Consider, for example, the global anti-Iraq war march on 15 February 2003. This was the largest synchronised protest in human history. Ten million people worldwide went into the streets with a single demand: \u201cno war!\u201d And yet, a month later, the Iraq war started despite global opposition. The anti-war movement was effectively destroyed. </p> <p>A compelling theory of protest failure would apply equally to Occupy and the global anti-Iraq war march. Therefore, a lack of demands cannot be the true reason. No, there is something deeper going on.</p> <p>To understand why our protests are failing we need to look instead at the story motivating our performance as activists. What script are protesters following when we flood into the streets? </p> <p>When citizens of nominally democratic governments protest in the streets they are performing the foundational myth of democracy: the faith that the people posses ultimate sovereignty over their governments. </p> <p>Here we have in simple terms the core myth that motivates all of contemporary activism: \u201cGovernments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,\u201d wrote the American revolutionaries in their Declaration of Independence, justifying insurrection. Or, in the words of the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/\">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> that was adopted by United Nations general assembly in 1948, \u201cThe will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government\u201d. Our misplaced faith in these statements is the crux of the crisis within activism.</p> <p>Protest has become the dominant way the people demonstrate their collective will. Obviously, if it were true that the authority of our governments derived from the will of the people, and the consent of the governed, than the public manifestation of the people\u2019s dissent \u2014 protest \u2014 would be an effective strategy for manifesting a sovereign power over our governments. Activists assume that if we get enough citizens into the streets then we, the people, will magically exert a popular authority over elected representatives. It is a beautiful story. But it is no longer true.</p> <p>Contemporary protest is broken because the will of the people is no longer the basis of the authority of government. Put colourfully, the people\u2019s sovereignty is dead and every protest is a hopeless struggle to revive the corpse. It is time to try a different method. </p> <p>When activists start to think in terms of attaining sovereignty, it becomes abundantly clear that if we cannot demonstrate our will through public protest then only two paths remain: we can win wars or we can win elections.</p> <p>Street protests alone won\u2019t achieve the change we need. </p> <p>The authority of government accrues to whomever changes the existing regime militarily or electorally. If activism is to stay relevant, we must apply our techniques of protest, and social movement creation, to either winning wars or winning elections. Neither approach will look the way you expect it.</p> <p>I believe that focusing on winning elections is the correct path strategically and morally. However, I have noticed that whenever I broach the subject of merging protest with electoral politics, most activists quickly assume that I\u2019m advocating a traditional, progressive electoral strategy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Radical activists need not work within the existing party apparatuses. </p> <p>On the contrary, I find inspiration in contemporary hybrid movement-parties like Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement, Spain\u2019s Podemos or Iceland\u2019s Pirate Party. Even in nations dominated by a two-party system, such as the US and arguably Australia, I see opportunities for activists to intervene electorally without giving up their revolutionary edge. I\u2019m emboldened, above all, by the experience of the little-known New Alliance Party whose 1988 candidate, Dr Lenora Fulani, became the first woman to run for president of the United States and get on the ballot in all 50 states. This was an immense organising challenge that required gathering over one million signatures, a feat that the Green party was unable to accomplish in 2016. Dr Fulani and the New Alliance Party were able to pull it off because of their years of community organising in poor communities of colour. When outsider candidates are backed by grassroots movements the impossible becomes possible. </p> <p>What does this all mean, in concrete terms, for today\u2019s activists who dream of instigating significant social change? </p> <p>Very few people have thought about activist electoral strategy as deeply as Jacqueline Salit, a former campaign manager for Dr Fulani\u2019s presidential campaign and an ongoing leader in America\u2019s independent political movement. Salit offers two pieces of advice in a <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1748953/Documents/Finding%20Otherness%20by%20J%20Salit.pdf\">recent strategy briefing for activists</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/06/activism-rural-america-occupy-movement\">Want to be part of the next wave of activism? Move to rural America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First, she observes that, \u201cthe most successful independent parties in recent times have been \u2018anti-party\u2019 parties.\u201d In other words, as activists pivot toward winning elections our movements should not imitate the form or content of existing political parties. Instead, we must position our movements as protest parties \u2014 anti-party parties \u2014 whose ascension will be the death of established parties. </p> <p>Salit\u2019s second piece of advice is most important. Advocating for \u201ccross-ideological partnerships,\u201d Salit urges activists to \u201cput ideology on the back burner and move on to democracy, to unrigging the system.\u201d This post-ideological perspective is perhaps most difficult for activists to accept but it is a strategic necessity of an electoral strategy. Rather than fully aligning our movements with preexisting political categories, there is strength in poaching from across the left-right political spectrum.</p> <p>Moving forward, as activists we must radically challenge the roots of our discipline and embark on a period of wild tactical experimentation oriented around capturing sovereignty. Let us no longer tolerate those within our movements who stifle collective reflection on our failures. Only a total rethink of protest will lead to the emergence of newly effective methods of revolutionary activism. </p> <ul> <li>Micah White is co-creator of Occupy Wall Street and author of The End of Protest: A New Playbook for Revolution<br></li> </ul> <p><em>Micah White will speak </em><em>at </em><em><a href=\"https://antidote.sydneyoperahouse.com/lineup-2017/micah-white-the-end-of-protest.html?icid=144215:WT:p05:20170828\">Antidote: A Festival of Ideas, Art &amp; Action</a> at the Sydney Opera House on 2-3 September, which replaces Festival of Dangerous Ideas in 2017.</em></p>"

BIE appears to be a very <a href=\"https://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/training-events/introduction-domestic-extremism-and-hate-groups\">new term</a> within law enforcement, Foreign Policy noted. </p> <p>Elsa Waithe, a comedian and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/04/nypd-police-black-lives-matter-surveillance-undercover\">activist with Black Lives Matter</a>, said she feared the FBI\u2019s classification could deter people from joining protests and further \u201ccriminalize anyone who is already in the movement\u201d.</p> <p>She noted that she often wears a \u201cblack power\u201d button and could easily see the FBI labeling her as a threat as a result: \u201cThe term \u2018black identity extremist\u2019 is so vague on purpose \u2026 If I wanted to do a picnic for black folks, is this now some sort of terrorist activity?\u201d</p> <p>But law enforcement threats would not discourage her, she said. \u201cThis changes nothing. For some people, this means we fight harder.\u201d</p> <p>Some reports have suggested that the Trump administration has also pushed to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-extremists-program-exclusiv/exclusive-trump-to-focus-counter-extremism-program-solely-on-islam-sources-idUSKBN15G5VO\">focus counter-terrorism efforts solely on Islamist extremism</a> and no longer target white supremacist groups.

     "standfirst": "Kathryn Bigelow directs John Boyega in a stunningly shot story of disturbing police brutality and civil unrest in 1960s Detroit",
     "body": "<p>Having become the first woman to win the Oscar for best director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/mar/08/kathryn-bigelow-oscars-best-director\">with <em>The Hurt Locker </em>in 2010</a>, Kathryn Bigelow became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/jan/25/zero-dark-thirty-reel-history\">focus of controversy</a> when 2012\u2019s <em>Zero Dark Thirty</em> was accused of somehow endorsing the use of torture in the hunt for Osama bin Laden (Naomi Wolf ludicrously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/04/letter-kathryn-bigelow-zero-dark-thirty\">compared Bigelow to Leni Riefenstahl</a>). Torture rears its ugly head again in <em>Detroit</em>, but this time in a context that leaves no room for misinterpretation. Revisiting a shocking \u201cincident\u201d that took place amid five days of rioting in the summer of 1967, <em>Detroit</em> is a provocative period piece made all the more alarming by its stark contemporary relevance. More than 40 people died during the so-called \u201cDetroit rebellion\u201d, most of them African Americans, many shot by the police or national guardsmen. In attempting to unpack \u201cthe anatomy of an uprising\u201d, Bigelow focuses in on a harrowing tragedy that has become emblematic of the racial tensions still haunting the US.</p> <p><em>Detroit</em> opens with a contextualising history lesson, animating <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2015/onewayticket/panel/1/intro\">Jacob Lawrence\u2019s vivid paintings of the \u201cgreat migration\u201d</a> to recount the movement of African Americans from the rural south toward the industrialised north and midwest. Here, poverty-ridden urban ghettos offer a life where equality is \u201can illusion\u201d and change is \u201cinevitable\u201d. When police raid a Detroit speakeasy in July 1967, civil unrest erupts, with state troopers and guardsmen sent into \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d to quell protesters and looters alike. \u201cThis is like fuckin\u2019 \u2019Nam,\u201d says Will Poulter\u2019s PhilipKrauss, a fictionalised character (one of several) described by screenwriter Mark Boal as <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2017/07/mark-boal-on-why-he-wrote-the-movie-detroit.html\">\u201cinspired by the actions and recorded deeds of a Detroit policeman\u201d</a> who takes lethal pot-shots at looters under the pretext of protecting the neighbourhood.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/17/kathryn-bigelow-on-detroit-theres-a-radical-desire-not-to-face-the-reality-of-race\">Kathryn Bigelow on Detroit: \u2018There\u2019s a radical desire not to face the reality of race\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, at the downtown Fox theatre, the disturbances rob rising stars the Dramatics of their moment in the spotlight, leaving singer Cleveland Larry Reed, played by Algee Smith, to perform a cappella to an empty auditorium \u2013 a spine-tingling moment. But it\u2019s when Krauss and his uniformed henchmen descend upon an annex of the Algiers motel, where Reed and Fred Temple (Jacob Latimore) have sought safe haven, that <em>Detroit</em> shifts into something resembling a horror movie \u2013 a genre last explored by Bigelow in her vampire-western <em>Near Dark</em>. Searching for an alleged sniper, and inflamed by the discovery of two white girls whom Vietnam veteran Robert Greene (Anthony Mackie) is accused of pimping, these rogue cops embark upon a brutal \u201cdeath game\u201d \u2013 a violent interrogation involving murderous playacting which soon becomes a nightmarish reality.</p> <p>Paul Greengrass\u2019s regular cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, who brought such urgent verisimilitude to Bigelow and Boal\u2019s <em>The Hurt Locker</em>, once again lends a documentarian\u2019s eye to the drama, using vintage lenses to capture multi-angle digital footage (<a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2017/07/27/kathryn-bigelow-went-looking-for-detroit-she-found-boston/9KY2lRWwP8XjithXB9sCcJ/story.html\">largely shot around Boston</a>), which interweaves seamlessly with archive material. Just as <em>Point Break</em> plunged its audience into breakneck chases and <em>Strange Days</em> toyed with virtual reality (a medium recently explored by Bigelow in the ivory-poachers documentary short <a href=\"http://www.walkinginrangersshoes.com/\"><em>The Protectors</em></a>), so <em>Detroit</em> is an immersive experience which places the viewer at the heart of this unfolding chaos. It\u2019s a sprawling, volatile melee of a movie, excellently edited by William Goldenberg and Harry Yoon, who jostle their way through a crowd of stories to focus in on one claustrophobic flashpoint.</p> <p>Aiding that focus is an ensemble cast at the top of their game. British up-and-comer John Boyega (who shone in <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em>) is brilliant as <a href=\"http://variety.com/2017/film/news/detroit-melvin-dismukes-interview-1202511170/\">Melvin Dismukes</a>, the security guard who is caught between his race and his uniform as he attempts to mediate between brutal police and tortured suspects, earning disdain and distrust from both sides. There\u2019s something of the young Denzel Washington in Boyega\u2019s physicality \u2013 the ability to convey both strength and vulnerability through the tiniest facial gestures. Algee Smith is terrific too, perfectly capturing the traumatising loss of innocence that his character undergoes. You can almost hear the sweet music draining from his soul, drowned out by discord and disharmony. As for Will Poulter (another Brit making international waves), he is perfectly cast as Krauss, whose malevolence lurks beneath an innocent facade. A scene in which Krauss forces his petrified prisoners to pray reminded me of the absurdist, bullying bigotry conveyed with such force by Gene Hackman in <em>The French Connection</em>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv74LqiumXE\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yv74LqiumXE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv74LqiumXE\">Watch a trailer for Detroit.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Crucially, despite the efficiently evoked period setting (plaudits to production designer Jeremy Hindle) there\u2019s nothing distant about <em>Detroit</em>. As a broad-canvas work that shifts from social realism to courtroom drama via crime thriller, musical fantasy and social chiller, it confirms Bigelow as a dextrous master of her craft. As a wake-up call to a nation, it is tense, tough and terrifyingly timely.</p>"

Black Lives Matter UK and the <a href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.com/herstory/\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter US network</a> need to set the record straight:</p> <p>1) Black Lives Matter is a global black queer femme-led intersectional movement and network that works across multiple issues. We do not believe in single-issue stories.</p> <p>2) Environmental injustice has always been an issue and a fight taken on by black and poor communities. We are the first to die, but we are also the first to fight on the frontlines.</p> <p>3) The inequalities that turn an extreme weather event into a disaster or human catastrophe mirror the inequalities that cause the disproportionate loss of black and poor life globally \u2013 and the exact systems that Black Lives Matter fights against.</p> <p>In the last few weeks, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/31/houston-hurricane-storm-harvey-recovery-donald-trump\" title=\"\">Houston</a> to <a href=\"http://www.okayafrica.com/in-brief/flooding-venue-state-nigera-buhari-response/\" title=\"\">central Nigeria</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/14/deaths-sierra-leone-mudslide-regent\" title=\"\">Sierra Leone</a> to South Asia and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/13/hurricane-irma-cuba-havana-flooding-government-response\" title=\"\">the Caribbean</a>, we are once again seeing coastal and vulnerable areas hit by catastrophic extreme weather.</p> <p>Climate change is global, and its impact will be felt globally by most, but when we assess factors such as death, disease, access to resources/aid, insurance policy holders, land ownership, means to evacuate from danger zones, quality of and access to housing, displacement, and forced migration, these <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/07/black-lives-matter-protesters-air-pollution-race-issue-london\" title=\"\">harsh realities disproportionately affect</a> black and poor communities after a disaster, not white ones.</p> <p>We are not saying that white people do not feel the impact of climate change.

The scale and impact of the destruction cannot be fully understood without reference to the racism that underpins climate change and state responses to it. The Conservative government has shown once again that it systematically fails black and poor people \u2013 take its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/commentisfree/2017/jun/15/the-guardian-view-on-grenfell-tower-theresa-may-hurricane-katrina\" title=\"\">response to the Grenfell Tower disaster</a> \u2013 providing inadequate protection prior to the disaster, and insufficient allocation of time, resources and care in the face of our communities\u2019 pain and loss.</p> <p>Governments\u2019 response to these disasters is an indicator of how they value black lives. They simply do not. Yet they can find the time and resources to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41217674\" title=\"\">send officers</a> to police our pain and control our outpouring of grief. Rightwing governments may excuse their response, say it\u2019s sufficient, but they have proven time and again that they are incompetent to govern. We must collectively demand accountability for the ways they treat our communities in times of crisis. Crises that they largely created. Inequalities \u2013 whether those that compound the impact of the floods in Sierra Leone, or the lack of response and resources received post Hurricane Irma, or those that leave black and poor lives more vulnerable to pollution-related illness in the UK \u2013 are all part of the same system.</p> <p>None of this is incidental. Just as individual black deaths in police custody must be understood as part of a wider system founded upon racist ideology and practices, so must the tragic case of <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/london-s-air-was-the-silent-killer-of-my-daughter-claims-mother-a3470896.html\" title=\"\">Ella Kissi-Debrah</a>, who was exposed to illegal levels of pollution in the UK. The same system which props up the violent policing of our children on the streets is responsible for allowing dangerous toxins to be emitted in our backyards.</p> <p>While the media favours whitewashing, atomised, \u201csingle-issue\u201d stories, we must recognise that it is only by challenging this unjust system from every necessary angle, as well as by connecting the dots between our daily struggles and global crises, that we can truly begin to build a better world for all black lives and protect our communities from the impact of climate change. As long as black and poor people are seen as disposable bodies, not worthy of the care afforded to other citizens, then we will be there, making noise, taking space, and saying it loud and clear: climate change is a racist crisis.</p> <p>\u2022 Patrisse Cullors is a native-born Angeleno and an artist, organiser and freedom fighter.

This way of thinking presumes these groups should stop blaming \u201cthe system\u201d and take accountability for their collective condition.</p> <p> In the US, for the most part, it asserts that our institutions and social systems are unbiased, and that if one works hard, one is able to \u201csucceed\u201d. Employers of this narrative lean on the significance of \u201cbad behaviours\u201d to explain stifled advancement.</p> <p>For example, cultural deficiency theorists might assert the reason black people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/18/mass-incarceration-black-americans-higher-rates-disparities-report\">disproportionately represented in US prisons</a> at exceedingly high degrees is because black people are committing crimes at disproportionately high rates. But a more productive assessment of this phenomenon would include an analysis and critique of the hyper-policing of black communities, the legacy of the \u201c<a href=\"http://time.com/3746059/war-on-crime-history/\">War on Crime</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/03/16/return-failed-war-drugs-us\">War on Drugs</a>\u201d in the development of the contemporary carceral state, and the continued hyper-sentencing of black people.

This reality makes itself visible not only in our criminal justice system but in so many aspects of daily American life \u2013 yet many of us don\u2019t notice it, because anti-blackness is usually not overt. It no longer hangs plainly on the front door of a restaurant reading \u201cwhites only\u201d; it is cloaked in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/13/barack-obama-legacy-racism-criminal-justice-system\">neoliberal colourblindness and post-racialism</a>.</p> <p>This reality claims that black people should dress \u201crespectfully\u201d to avoid being profiled by the police.

     "body": "<p>Undercover officers in the New York police department infiltrated small groups of Black Lives Matter activists and gained access to their text messages, according to newly released NYPD documents obtained by the Guardian.</p> <p>The records, produced in response to a freedom of information <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nypd-disclose-surveillance-black-lives-matter-protesters-article-1.2967219\">lawsuit</a> led by New York law firm Stecklow &amp; Thompson, provide the most detailed picture yet of the sweeping scope of NYPD surveillance during mass protests over the death of Eric Garner in <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nypd-disclose-surveillance-black-lives-matter-protesters-article-1.2967219\">2014 and 2015</a>. Lawyers said the new documents raised questions about NYPD compliance with city rules.</p> <p>The documents, mostly emails between undercover officers and other NYPD officials, follow other disclosures that the NYPD regularly <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2017/3/22/15016984/nypd-video-surveillance-protests-occupy-black-lives-matter\">filmed Black Lives Matter activists</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/29/nypd-black-lives-matter-undercover-protests\">sent</a> undercover personnel to protests. The NYPD has not responded to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment or interview.</p> <p>Emails show that undercover officers were able to pose as protesters even within small groups, giving them extensive access to details about protesters\u2019 whereabouts and plans. In one email, an official notes that an undercover officer is embedded within a group of seven protesters on their way to Grand Central Station. This intimate access appears to have helped police pass as trusted organizers and extract information about demonstrations. In other emails, officers share the locations of individual protesters at particular times. The NYPD emails also include pictures of organizers\u2019 group text exchanges with information about protests, suggesting that undercover officials were either trusted enough to be allowed to take photos of activists\u2019 phones or were themselves members of a private planning group text.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"logue v nypd\">  <iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/343928504/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-LuI8k1LU6pSSrj4by7yE&show_recommendations=true\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7735849056603774\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_27289\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>    <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa9edab0fc11df224fba2c221abc3d59f2500f68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa9edab0fc11df224fba2c221abc3d59f2500f68/74_24_506_304/500.png\" alt=\"protesters text message\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police obtained access to protesters\u2019 text messages, the documents show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NYPD/Screenshot/Scribd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThat text loop was definitely just for organizers, I don\u2019t know how that got out,\u201d said Elsa Waithe, a Black Lives Matter organizer. \u201cSomeone had to have told someone how to get on it, probably trusting someone they had seen a few times in good faith. We clearly compromised ourselves.\u201d<br></p> <p>Keegan Stephan, a regular attendee of the Grand Central protests in 2014 and 2015, said information about protesters\u2019 whereabouts was limited to a small group of core organizers at that time. \u201cI feel like the undercover was somebody who was or is very much a part of the group, and has access to information we only give to people we trust,\u201d said Stephan, who has been assisting attorneys with a lawsuit to obtain the documents on behalf of plaintiff James Logue, a protester. \u201cIf you\u2019re walking to Grand Central with a handful of people for an action, that\u2019s much more than just showing up to a public demonstration \u2013 that sounds like a level of friendship.\u201d</p> <p>Joseph Giacalone, a retired NYPD detective sergeant and professor at John Jay College, agreed that it would not be easy for an undercover officer to join a small group of protesters and hear their plans. \u201cIt would be pretty amazing that they would be able to get into the core group in such a short window of time,\u201d said Giacalone. \u201cThis could have been going on a while before for these people to get so close to the inner circle.\u201d</p> <p>The NYPD documents also included a handful of pictures and one short video taken at Grand Central Station demonstrations. Most are pictures of crowds milling about or taking part in demonstrations. In one picture of a small group of activists, the NYPD identifies an individual in a brown jacket as the \u201cmain protester\u201d. These images of protesters are reminiscent of <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/08/18/undercover-police-spied-on-ny-black-lives-matter/\">those taken by undercover transit police</a>, who were also deployed to Black Lives Matter protests in Grand Central Station in 2015.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f8344efd21ae2d6c2a0bd41d8ec7aaaf87cdd69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f8344efd21ae2d6c2a0bd41d8ec7aaaf87cdd69/0_54_1264_758/1000.png\" alt=\"nypd documents\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An individual is identified as the \u2018main protester\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NYPD/Screenshot/Scribd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Giacalone said this type of leadership identification was standard police practice at protests. \u201cIf you take out the biggest mouth, everybody just withers away, so you concentrate on the ones you believe are your organizers,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you identify that person, you can run computer checks on them to see if they have a warrant out or any summons failures, then you can drag them in before they go out to speak or rile up the crowd, as long as you have reasonable cause to do so.\u201d</p> <p>Attorneys say the documents raise legal questions about whether the NYPD was acting in compliance with the department\u2019s intelligence-gathering rules, known as the Handschu Guidelines. The guidelines, which are based on an ongoing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/nyregion/new-york-to-appoint-monitor-to-review-polices-counterterrorism-activity.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0\">decades-old class-action lawsuit</a>, hold that the NYPD can begin formally investigating first amendment activity \u201cwhen facts or circumstances reasonably indicate that an unlawful act has been, is being, or will be committed\u201d and if the police surveillance plan has been authorized by a committee known as the <a href=\"https://www.nyclu.org/en/cases/handschu-v-special-services-division-challenging-nypd-surveillance-practices-targeting\">Handschu Authority</a>. (That committee was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/nyregion/nypd-spying-muslims-surveillance-lawsuit.html?_r=0\">exclusively staffed</a> by NYPD officials at the time.) However, <a href=\"https://www.nyclu.org/sites/default/files/8.6.03_Handschu_Guidelines.pdf\">according to the guidelines</a>, before launching a formal investigation, the NYPD can also conduct investigative work such as \u201cchecking of leads\u201d and \u201cpreliminary inquiries\u201d with even lower standards of suspicion. </p> <p>Michael Price, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said it was difficult to know whether NYPD\u2019s undercover surveillance operations crossed the line, as the documents did not make clear what, if any, stage of investigation the police were in at the time of the operations. But he said the department\u2019s retention of pictures and video raised questions, since police are not allowed to retain information about public events unless it relates to unlawful activity.</p> <p>\u201cSo my question would be: what was the unlawful activity that police had reason to suspect here?\u201d said Price. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear that there was any criminal behavior they were talking about in the emails. Most references are to protesters being peaceful, so I would be very concerned if they were hinging their whole investigation on civil disobedience, such as unpermitted protests or blocking of pedestrians.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout the emails, the NYPD\u2019s undercover sources provide little indication of any unlawful activity, frequently characterizing demonstrators as peaceful and orderly with only one mention of a single arrest.</p> <p>\u201cThe documents uniformly show no crime occurring, but NYPD had undercovers inside the protests for months on end as if they were al-Qaida,\u201d said David Thompson, an attorney of Stecklow &amp; Thompson, who helped sue for the records.</p> <p>Giacalone argued that police could have easily come up with a legal justification to initiate surveillance, especially if such operations occurred after the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/nyregion/two-police-officers-shot-in-their-patrol-car-in-brooklyn.html\">shooting of two NYPD officers in December of 2014</a> (all dates in the NYPD\u2019s email communications were redacted). But he noted that such investigative activities would be harder to justify if officers were not directly observing signs of unlawful activity.</p> <p>\u201cIf they\u2019re not talking about any crimes being committed, they\u2019re going to have a difficult time defending this. It may end up in another one of these lawsuits,\u201d said Giacalone. \u201cSome may say this is good police work, fine, but good police work or not, we have rules against this kind of thing in New York.\u201d</p> <p>Attorneys have already filed a petition charging that the NYPD may have failed to produce all of its surveillance records. But for some protesters, the damage has already been done.</p> <p>\u201cIn the first couple of months, we had a lot of people in and out of the group, some because they didn\u2019t fit our style but others because of the whispers that they were undercovers,\u201d recalled Waithe. \u201cWhether it was real or perceived, that was the most debilitating part for me, the whispers \u2026 It\u2019s really hard to organize when you can\u2019t trust each other.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p><em><strong>Warning: contains spoilers</strong></em></p> <p>By finishing its fourth season in such a state of emotional devastation, Orange is the New Black certainly upped the ante for season five. It saw the end of one of its most popular characters when an untrained correctional officer inadvertently killed everyone\u2019s favourite librarian, Poussey; another guard, Humps, walked in to Litchfield with a gun, until the prisoners intercepted it in the subsequent uproar and the beginnings of a riot appeared to take shape. Early details about the show\u2019s return promised that the entire season would take place in the immediate aftermath of the firearm cliffhanger, taking us deep into the riot. With clear allusions to the Black Lives Matter movement laid out and ready to be taken further, it sounded promising and ambitious.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/08/orange-is-the-new-black-season-five-behind-the-scenes\">A riot in real time: how Orange is the New Black is changing the rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is ambitious, but not entirely successful. OITNB has at times struggled to balance two very distinct tones: ridiculous, warm-hearted slapstick comedy that snaps into serious drama, devoted to pushing its message about penal reform. This time the disconnect is enough to give you whiplash. A prison riot largely centred on the unjust killing of an innocent inmate should be sufficient drama to sustain the season, but it\u2019s as if the writers lost their nerve \u2013 and quickly.</p> <p>What we have instead is a series of set pieces of varying levels of seriousness, with little time for any of the principle storylines to settle in and have an impact. The prisoners are left to run Litchfield alone after taking the guards and warden hostage. A coffee shop is established, which brings together the comedy Nazis and the ethnicities they profess to despise, all in the name of caffeine. There\u2019s an art competition to build a tribute to Poussey, as well as a makeover segment and a training montage. There\u2019s a subplot that plays out like a horror film, and is genuinely frightening. But in a particularly queasy episode-long stunt, the prisoners force their captive guards to reenact American Idol at gunpoint. There\u2019s no real aim other than humiliation, and it\u2019s hard to find the humour that\u2019s supposed to be there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76e42f7874c1f01ff4a8bf5ea681fde8d63db1e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76e42f7874c1f01ff4a8bf5ea681fde8d63db1e4/0_80_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taystee proves herself to be a negotiator worthy of a position in the UN, not just Caputo\u2019s office.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There are high points \u2026 Taystee proves herself to be a negotiator worthy of a position in the UN, not just Caputo\u2019s office.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jojo Whilden/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Where OITNB succeeds is in its flexibility. With such a huge cast, it has been able to shift its attentions over the course of five seasons from Piper, the waspy new inmate approaching prison with wide-eyed horror, to other characters who more accurately reflect the problems with the system. Though I\u2019ve missed Laverne Cox\u2019s Sophia having anything much to do, the renewed focus this season on Taystee and Gloria is very welcome. Taystee proves herself to be a budding activist and negotiator worthy of a position in the UN, not just Caputo\u2019s office, while Gloria\u2019s attempts to find a form of motherhood somewhere, anywhere, is heartbreaking. Uzo Aduba is astonishing as Suzanne/Crazy Eyes, whose stability begins to crumble as her routine breaks down, and the short flashback to longtime inmate Frieda\u2019s doomsday-prepper origins is surprisingly sweet and emotional.</p> <p>But too much has stayed the same. The writers continue to play Alex and Piper\u2019s will-they-won\u2019t-they relationship like an accordion. Nicky may be sober but she\u2019s still craving Lorna, who is still living in a fantasy world. Red hams it up with the aid of more back story, but even her sudden reliance on \u201cvitamins\u201d and fixation on getting revenge on Piscatella isn\u2019t enough to lift her out of the same old prison-matriarch routine. Doggett\u2019s confusing relationship with the guard who sexually assaulted her rumbles on, while the injustices of the system remain exactly the same: despite the prisoners demanding a voice, there still isn\u2019t enough money to treat them as human beings and turn a profit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c8fee2c0d4b7a8a553e3c950a4501cdd19be389\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c8fee2c0d4b7a8a553e3c950a4501cdd19be389/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Too much has stayed the same \u2026 the writers continue to play Alex and Piper\u2019s will-they-won\u2019t-they relationship like an accordion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">But too much has stayed the same \u2026 the writers continue to play Alex and Piper\u2019s will-they-won\u2019t-they relationship like an accordion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jojo Whilden/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the key problems with the season is timing. It\u2019s hard to grasp the timeframe. It officially takes place over three days, but it could be more, or less. That means it simultaneously drags, and then, towards the end, after ambling around for a few hours, everything happens all at once. This may be of less significance for a streaming drama, with each episode urged onwards by autoplay, but it still makes the season sag midway through. </p> <p>The last episode, however, was everything it should have been up until this point, bringing a genuine feeling of shock and peril to the show. It has been renewed for another two seasons after this, with showrunner Jenji Kohan remaining in charge, but it\u2019s hard to know where it\u2019s going to go after such an enormous reset. Let\u2019s hope it runs towards the risk, instead of hiding in the basement.</p>"

     "body": "<p>All NFL players should stand during the national anthem, the football league\u2019s boss, Roger Goodell, said on Tuesday, as the controversy over protests against police brutality by players and their dispute with Donald Trump rumbled on.<br></p> <p>In a letter to the NFL\u2019s 32 teams, Goodell said a plan was under way to \u201cmove past\u201d the debacle. </p> <p>\u201cLike many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the national anthem,\u201d the commissioner wrote. \u201cIt is an important moment in our game. We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/08/mike-pence-leaves-nfl-game-protests\">Pence follows Trump order and walks out of 49ers-Colts after players kneel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He added: \u201cWe also care deeply about our players and respect their opinions and concerns about critical social issues. The controversy over the anthem is a barrier to having honest conversations and making real progress on the underlying issues.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to move past this controversy, and we want to do that together with our players.\u201d</p> <p>Although Goodell did not specify if and how the league plans to ensure that players stand during the anthem, his letter suggested the issue will be discussed during a series of regularly scheduled NFL meetings set to take place next week. Under current NFL policy, it is recommended that players stand during the national anthem but not required of them.</p> <p>Goodell\u2019s comments came as the ongoing controversy over players \u201ctaking a knee\u201d during the anthem was seized upon again by Trump over the weekend. The president claimed to have instructed Vice-President Mike Pence to walk out of an NFL game on Sunday between the Indianapolis Colts and San Francisco 49ers if and when players kneeled during the anthem.</p> <p>While Trump subsequently praised Pence\u2019s early exit, the move drew a backlash for being orchestrated by the White House at a reported cost of more than $200,000 to US taxpayers. Pence also came under fire for tweeting a photo of himself and his wife Karen donning Colts gear that was taken in 2014, furthering the notion that the moment was a planned publicity stunt.</p> <p>Trump escalated his feud with the NFL on Tuesday by attacking the league on Twitter.</p> <p>\u201cWhy is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!\u201d the president tweeted.</p> <p>Although the NFL headquarters once held tax-exempt status, as did other major professional sports leagues and trade associations, individual team owners were still required to pay federal taxes on all team revenue. The league office gave up its tax-free status in 2015, an NFL spokesman said in response to Trump on Tuesday.</p> <p>Trump has nonetheless felt emboldened by his attacks on the NFL, despite drawing a torrent of criticism late last month for referring to players who kneeled during the national anthem as \u201csons of bitches\u201d and calling for them to be fired. The protests, which have mostly comprised black athletes, were intended to draw attention to police brutality and the need for criminal justice reform.</p> <p>The Dallas Cowboys owner and general manager, Jerry Jones, publicly sided with Trump on Sunday, stating in no uncertain terms that players would be penalized for protesting during the national anthem.</p> <p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything that is disrespectful to the flag, then we will not play,\u201d Jones said. \u201cOK? Understand? If we are disrespecting the flag, then we won\u2019t play. Period.\u201d </p> <p>While it remained unclear if the NFL was moving toward a rules change around the anthem, which is played just before each game, the White House threw its support behind the idea on Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cI think we would certainly support the NFL coming out and asking players to stand, just as the president has done,\u201d the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said at a press briefing. \u201cWe support the national anthem, the flag, and the men and women who fought to defend it. And our position hasn\u2019t changed on that front. We\u2019re glad to see the NFL taking positive steps in that direction.\u201d</p> <p>Later Trump took a swipe at professional athletes who have publicly vowed to boycott the White House. Greeting the Pittsburgh Penguins, winner of ice hockey\u2019s Stanley Cup, the president began by saying: \u201cBy the way, everybody wanted to be here today and I know why.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0adffe401fca9a433cd1444ae2d47e923bc3ac0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0adffe401fca9a433cd1444ae2d47e923bc3ac0d/0_146_3817_2290/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump/Pittsburgh Penguins\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump speaks during a ceremony to welcome Stanley Cup champions, the Pittsburgh Penguins, to the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Doulie/Sipa USA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Accompanied by first lady Melania, it was the first time that Trump had hosted a sports team since the NFL controversy erupted. He did not make a direct reference to the flag or anthem but could not resist a bizarre political exchange with Ron Burkle, a California billionaire and co-owner of the Penguins. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend of mine for a long time, he\u2019s a great, great negotiator,\u201d Trump said, turning to Burkle, who grinned widely. \u201cRon, how about negotiating some of our horrible trade deals that they\u2019ve made?\u2026 I really mean that. If you want to get involved in negotiating Nafta, I like it, because we\u2019re renegotiating Nafta, Ron.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/oct/10/mike-ditka-no-oppression-100-years-anthem-protests\">Mike Ditka rips NFL protests: 'There has been no oppression in the last 100 years'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then Trump sought reassurance: \u201cYou\u2019re not on the other side of Nafta, Ron, are you?\u201d Burkle smiled and told him: \u201cI am not.\u201d</p> <p>Later, the Penguins\u2019 coach, Mike Sullivan, insisted that the visit had been non-political and there had been \u201czero\u201d discussion of the issue with Trump. \u201cWe understand the circumstance surrounding this visit,\u201d he told reporters outside the West Wing. \u201cWe\u2019re very respectful of anyone\u2019s right to protest or demonstrate as they see fit.\u201d</p> <p>Pressed by an African American journalist that there was an appearance of complicity, Sullivan replied: \u201cWell, see, you\u2019re suggesting that that\u2019s the case.
