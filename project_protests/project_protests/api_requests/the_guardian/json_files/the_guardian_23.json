The artist from South Central LA piled up stones and gravel outside the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/15/venice-biennale-slaps-drenchings-and-dobermans-on-the-prowl\">US pavilion</a>, to make it look like Monticello, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/18/america-complicated-history-slavery-thomas-jefferson-monticello-virginia\">the plantation in Virginia owned by Thomas Jefferson</a>, the third US president. Bradford made visitors enter via a side door, as plantation slaves would have, and filled the inside with his abstract expressionist art, inspired by everything from the rise of Trump to police violence and Black Lives Matter. The result, he says, was his \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/arts/design/mark-bradford-venice-biennale.html\">most urgent exhibition to date</a>\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"33e9fa9f7586bda4c5af6644d57c52ea82ac6966\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33e9fa9f7586bda4c5af6644d57c52ea82ac6966/0_0_3061_3637/842.jpg\" alt=\"Inside Mark Bradford\u2019s US Pavilion at the 2017 Venice Biennale.\" width=\"842\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside Mark Bradford\u2019s US Pavilion at the 2017 Venice Biennale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His pavilion\u2019s full title, Tomorrow Is Another Day, echoed Vivien Leigh\u2019s last line in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gone-with-the-wind\">Gone With the Wind</a> \u2013 but his latest work confronts the American civil war more directly. Pickett\u2019s Charge, which will spread itself around the walls of the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington DC for the next year, is a monumental 400ft linear work inspired by the Gettysburg Cyclorama, French artist Paul Philippoteaux\u2019s vast 1883 depiction of the final assault in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/02/gettysburg-150th-anniversary-top-three-lessons\">Battle of Gettysburg</a>, often seen as the war\u2019s turning point.</p> <p>\u201cI became really fascinated by the romanticism around the civil war,\u201d says Bradford, who started researching the project three years ago. \u201cI\u2019d never really investigated it. I\u2019m black, the civil war was a good thing, the north won \u2013 that\u2019s all I knew. I thought it was going to be textbook, \u2018OK, this was bad and let\u2019s move on.\u2019 But it wasn\u2019t cut and dried.\u201d<br></p> <p>The more Bradford dug, the more he realised the period is still being fought over. There\u2019s a debate raging in the US about whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/18/the-guardian-view-on-confederate-statues-they-must-fall\">Confederate statues should be removed</a> from southern towns and cities, while the highest office in the land questions whether the south\u2019s fight to preserve slavery was wrong. In October, Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/31/john-kelly-says-us-civil-war-was-prompted-by-inability-to-compromise\">chief of staff John Kelly said</a> the Confederacy acted in \u201cgood faith\u201d and \u201cmade their stand where their conscience had them make their stand\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a complex and uncomfortable conversation we need to have,\u201d says Bradford. \u201cThen we begin to talk about race in this country in a very fundamental way \u2013 who founded it, who built it.\u201d </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQwfAd20GjM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AQwfAd20GjM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Mark Bradford: Pickett\u2019s Charge at the Hirshhorn Museum, Washington, DC</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Being uncomfortable is a state in which Bradford seems to thrive. Since he emerged from CalArts with a masters in fine art in the 1990s, he has made it his business to seek out awkward places within the art world. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to go into abstract painting,\u201d says Bradford, who loved the work of African American abstract artists Norman Lewis and Jack Whitten. \u201c\u2018Oh Mark, don\u2019t go there. We\u2019ve unpacked it, we\u2019ve theorised the paintings. Leave that alone.\u2019 I thought, that\u2019s exactly where I\u2019m going to go because you guys have canonised it. It was a political act. I\u2019m always hearing, \u2018Mark, that\u2019s not appropriate.\u2019 I didn\u2019t sign up to be an artist to be appropriate. I\u2019m not interested in the status quo.\u201d</p> <p>Bradford\u2019s use of salvaged materials \u2013 particularly billboards and advertising hoardings found near his LA home and studio \u2013 made him a rising star at the turn of the millennium. But even as he was finding some success, he still worked in his mother\u2019s beauty salon to make ends meet, and had to overcome early missteps, such as the 2004 Whitney Altria exhibition, which New York Times critic Roberta Smith savaged, saying it \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/05/arts/art-in-review-mark-bradford-katie-grinnan.html\">might as well be a group show of untried artists</a>\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I can show up hungover, jetlagged, anxious and scared \u2013 and still get going, still get my hands dirty</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cEvery time I finish a work I think it\u2019s the last thing I\u2019m ever going to do,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Back to the hair salon. I don\u2019t have anything else.\u201d The 55-year-old hasn\u2019t worked in the salon since his late 30s, though. He hasn\u2019t had to. Since selling his first work for <a href=\"http://nymag.com/arts/art/features/37954/\">$3,500 in 2001</a>, Bradford\u2019s paintings now <a href=\"http://www.culturetype.com/2015/05/16/mark-bradfords-smear-sells-for-record-4-3-at-sothebys/\">command sums of over $4m</a>. But, he says, a mixture of fear, hope and drive from his days at the hair salon keep him motivated.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not always inspired but I have incredible discipline,\u201d he says. \u201cI can show up hungover. I can show up full of energy. Jetlagged. Full of doubt. Anxious. Scared. But I show up and I get my hands dirty and I can get going. I\u2019m going to probably die like that \u2013 getting to the next piece of work. It\u2019s always the next one for me.\u201d </p> <p>Bradford isn\u2019t a fan of nostalgia or sentimentality. He\u2019s committed to a work and then, once it\u2019s completed, he moves on. He does talk about his past, though, and his mother Janice who raised him in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles\">Los Angeles</a>, moving between South Central, West Adams and the white, middle-class enclave of Santa Monica. They lived in a boarding house at one point, and Bradford didn\u2019t know his biological father \u2013 something he\u2019s thankful for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d59573191bc3534c50c84301f87ea02ce5f13fe3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d59573191bc3534c50c84301f87ea02ce5f13fe3/0_0_2400_1603/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The High Water Mark, one of the eight sections of Pickett\u2019s Charge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The High Water Mark, one of the eight sections of Pickett\u2019s Charge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua White</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI thought if I had a father, he more than likely wouldn\u2019t like the son I turned out to be,\u201d says Bradford, who is gay and was bullied at school. \u201cI could not figure out at six what I had done that was so bad. What sin had I committed that meant everybody had such disdain for me? What did I do? I\u2019d look at the teachers, the look on their faces, the kids on the campus, some of the parents. What did I do that was so bad? And I realised I did nothing, I was just me. And me wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d</p> <p>He says that being marginalised and rejected has influenced his art. \u201cThat feeds into the work. Pulling things from the streets, pulling things that are thrown away, pulling things that don\u2019t belong in the art world and willing them into it \u2013 demanding that these materials sit next to a Monet. That\u2019s part of it.\u201d</p> <p>The New York Times said Bradford is \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/fashion/jeffrey-deitch-faces-critics-at-moca.html\">if not the best painter working in America today, then certainly the tallest</a>\u201d, while a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/22/what-else-can-art-do\">New Yorker profile</a> started with the line: \u201cMark Bradford is the tallest artist I know \u2013 six feet seven and a half inches, and pencil thin, which makes him look taller.\u201d He\u2019s aware that his height and his race make their presence felt well before he does. \u201cI\u2019m black and I\u2019m really tall and before that I\u2019m gay,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m used to these large shadows looming that I have to navigate around.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7686d63f648367e89990ee0e2735a23974e62543\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7686d63f648367e89990ee0e2735a23974e62543/0_247_2400_994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I don\u2019t change for the rooms, I make the rooms adapt to me\u2019 ... the panel Dead Horse at the Hirshhorn Museum.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"414\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t change for the rooms, I make the rooms adapt to me\u2019 ... the panel Dead Horse at the Hirshhorn Museum.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua White</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bradford has also had to learn to navigate the middle-class art world, a place he didn\u2019t immediately like. He\u2019s considered leaving South Central \u2013 Bradford\u2019s a fan of Mexico City, Athens and Venice \u2013 but it\u2019s the area\u2019s energy that keeps him there. \u201cIt\u2019s shifting and moving and eating itself and becoming something different. I love it. The middle class is always bound by rules: you shouldn\u2019t do this, you must do that. It looks nice, everyone\u2019s lawn looks manicured, but I feel like I want to go up there and pee on one of them.\u201d</p> <p>Bradford may not have urinated on the US pavilion at Venice, but he certainly redecorated brazenly. That and Pickett\u2019s Charge confirm him as one of America\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/nov/03/theaster-gates-assemble-art-urban-regeneration-chicago\">most decorated and defiant artists</a>, one who is giving abstract expressionism new life nearly half a century after its heyday. \u201cI feel I belong wherever I decide to be,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t change for the rooms, I make the rooms adapt to me. I\u2019m going to be Mark all the time and I\u2019m going to make the room deal with me.

     "body": "<p>There is never a bad time to encounter James Baldwin, and as the wide success of the Oscar-nominated documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/20/i-am-not-your-negro-review-james-baldwin-raoul-peck\">I Am Not Your Negro</a> has made clear, the appetite in Trump\u2019s America for his prescient brilliance on race and civil rights is fierce and growing.</p> <p>His 1962 classic The Fire Next Time was originally a letter, written by Baldwin to his nephew on the 100th anniversary of the so-called emancipation of black America. In the letter\u2019s penultimate paragraph, Baldwin writes: \u201cThis is your home, my friend, do not be driven from it; great men have done great things here, and will again, and we can make America what America must become.\u201d It is rhythmically similar to Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/17/donald-trump-america-great-again-northampton-county-pennsylvania\">red-hatted mantra</a> \u2013 but there\u2019s a big difference between trying to make America \u201cgreat again\u201d and focusing on what it once was, rather than what it \u201cmust become\u201d.</p> <p>More than 50 years on, The Fire Next Time has been reprinted by <a href=\"https://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/photography/all/03145/facts.james_baldwin_the_fire_next_time_photographs_by_steve_schapiro.htm\">Taschen</a> in a beautiful new edition that pairs his text with images by the civil rights-era photographer Steve Schapiro. Baldwin was \u201cthe scribe of the movement, our illustrious griot, who knew our struggle because he lived it\u201d, as congressman John Lewis writes in the foreword. But before mobile phone videos and Twitter allowed black Americans to directly telegraph their plight to the world, it was up to photojournalism to visualise the message, as Schapiro\u2019s images did in Life magazine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/15/the-fire-this-time-legacy-of-james-baldwin\">The fire this time \u2013 the legacy of James Baldwin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Baldwin-Schapiro juxtaposition is an effective and powerful literary-visual pairing, not unalike the combination of Richard Wright\u2019s words in the 1941 classic <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Million-Black-Voices-Richard-Wright/dp/1560254467\">12 Million Black Voices</a> with black-and-white photos from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_Security_Administration\">Security Farm Administration</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://catalog.archives.gov/id/195824\">Great Depression archive</a>. Schapiro intimately captures many familiar faces \u2013 Lewis as a young activist in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Harry Belafonte and Martin Luther King \u2013 at a time when he \u201cwas not aware that [King] was going to be one of the most important people of our time\u201d, as he writes in the afterword. He also photographs a nameless nun, and countless black children and activists whose names are either lost to history or deserve to be as well known as Schapiro\u2019s beautiful portrait of Fannie Lou Hamer, or the gorgeous depictions of Baldwin and his smile.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ded8ce91cd4b2a1be9a784baad4fc14f599eb5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ded8ce91cd4b2a1be9a784baad4fc14f599eb5a/0_0_2000_2136/936.jpg\" alt=\"A spectator with a sign condemning police killings echoes the same grievances of today\u2019s Black Lives Matter movement.\" width=\"936\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A spectator at the Selma to Montgomery march with a sign condemning police killings presages the grievances of today\u2019s Black Lives Matter movement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Schapiro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of Schapiro\u2019s images \u2013 such as a woman at the 1965 Selma march with a sign reading \u201cStop Police Killing\u201d \u2013 could have come from any Black Lives Matter protest in the past three years.

Baldwin\u2019s words, too, channel both a love of black people and an urge to document white violence: \u201cWhen I was 10,\u201d he writes, \u201ctwo policemen amused themselves with me by frisking me, making comic (and terrifying) speculations concerning my ancestry and probable sexual prowess, and for good measure, leaving me flat on my back in one of Harlem\u2019s empty lots.\u201d</p> <p>Reading that made me reassess the fact that Carolyn Bryant \u2013 the woman who accused Emmett Till of whistling at her, triggered his lynching, helped his murderers go free and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/27/emmett-till-book-carolyn-bryant-confession\">recently admitted that she lied</a> \u2013 will not face punishment.

However, Baldwin\u2019s words give us some insight into the pain of being considered hypersexualised and dangerous by the same world that killed Till and Tamir Rice and Trayvon Martin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33ea66a2f1b71db96a35e25545f3eeaa06a4e7ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33ea66a2f1b71db96a35e25545f3eeaa06a4e7ee/0_0_3363_4134/813.jpg\" alt=\"Ralph Abernathy (rear) and Dr. King lead the way on the road to Montgomery.

Now comes news of a would-be landmark documentary focusing on the relationship between African-American communities and the police. \u201cYou have to find out what\u2019s the real struggle,\u201d Audience Network boss Chris Long <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2017/04/audience-network-vince-vaughn-documentary-police-race-relations-1202076419/\" title=\"\">declared</a> this week when he announced the project, \u201cand that\u2019s part of getting the story to be authentic.\u201d The other part is that it\u2019s going to be made by Vince Vaughn.</p> <p>I know! AT LAST. If you are one of those people who felt the issue was being held back by the lack of hilariously overpromoted white actors attempting to give it the full 360, the news could not come soon enough. Vince\u2019s Wild West Picture Show Productions has been working on the project for a year, according to Long, with the only sadness that the Swingers star will not direct, although he is apparently going to be very hands-on as a producer. As Long puts it: \u201cI said to him, \u2018Listen, [if I were you] I would embed. Hoop Dreams was a five-year embedment.\u201d Why do I get the feeling that Hoop Dreams is his only other documentary reference&nbsp;point with This Sort of Race Stuff?</p> <p>Having assessed what we might call <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000681/\" title=\"\">\u201cchurn\u201d</a> in Vince\u2019s IMDb entry, Lost in Showbiz judges that he certainly has the flexibility in his schedule for a five-year embed \u2013 but over to him. \u201cThe concept is really to humanise people on both sides,\u201d Vince explained to a Hollywood Radio &amp; Television Society event this week. Luckily, he seems to have contacts in both camps, albeit in the suspiciously vague sort of way one gets with actors. \u201cI\u2019ve had friends who\u2019ve grown up in that environment, I\u2019ve also had friends who are police officers, and there\u2019s a lot of fear on both sides.\u201d Hmm. I suspect we are moving toward a pointed corrective that ALL lives matter.</p> <p>Either way, with that kind of Rolodex, Vince is uniquely placed to bring this anguished story of our times to \u2026 I\u2019m sorry, I honestly haven\u2019t the will to finish the sentence. Perhaps later.</p> <p>In the meantime, it feels right&nbsp;to&nbsp;point out that the documentary could serve as an unofficial companion piece to Vince\u2019s other current project: a recently announced <a href=\"http://variety.com/2017/film/news/mel-gibson-vince-vaughn-police-brutality-movie-dragged-across-concrete-1201975594/\" title=\"\">buddy-cop movie about police brutality</a> in which he co-stars with Mr Mel Gibson. Set your sights on adventure! Time was when movies about necessarily violent&nbsp;cops who don\u2019t play by the rules were standard, uncomplicated fare, but the concept has rather fallen out of vogue of late. Who can possibly say why.</p> <p>Still, Dragged Across Concrete sees dear old Mel bumped out of the volatile younger cop role that he once made his own. He will instead play the old-timer to Vaughn\u2019s rookie, with the plot centring on two officers whose brutal tactics are filmed by a civilian, with the video becoming a cause celebre. I wonder whether the victim will be black, or if Hollywood will cleave to its rich tradition of pussying out of 90% of the major debates of any given age. Either way, it will be great to see Mel back on patrol, in an exploration of law enforcement that critics will call his finest since the performance beside the Malibu roadside, when he called the lady cop&nbsp;\u201csugar tits\u201d and <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2006/07/28/gibsons-anti-semitic-tirade-alleged-cover-up/\" title=\"\">explained</a> that&nbsp;the&nbsp;Jews were responsible for all the wars in the world.</p> <p>Actor-wise, it is undoubtedly an intriguing partnership. Vince is famously a libertarian; he endorsed both Ron and Rand Paul, considering his relationship with Ron Paul a serious friendship. He believes there aren\u2019t nearly enough guns in the US, previously <a href=\"http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/vince-vaughn-covers-july-issue-british-gq\" title=\"\">declaring</a>: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the right to bear arms because of burglars; we have the right to bear arms to resist the supreme power of a corrupt and abusive government.\u201d There should be guns in all schools, Vince has also explained, reasoning \u2013 is that the word? \u2013 that \u201cbanning guns is like banning forks in an attempt to stop people getting fat\u201d. You can see what might have drawn him to Mel; after all, there really is no more nuanced study of the possibilities of armed law enforcement in an era of small government than Mad Max.</p> <p>For his part, Mel seems to be forming quite the creative association with Vince. At a time when other directors seem less keen to bite, he gave him a role in Hacksaw Ridge, and the pair were seen sitting next to each other at the Golden Globes, where they both <a href=\"http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/20921-were-mel-gibson-and-vince-vaughn-less-than-thrilled-with-meryl-streeps-golden-globes-speech\" title=\"\">stared stonily</a> through Meryl Streep\u2019s speech about Trump\u2019s bullying. If anyone has the artistic courage to invigorate the buddy-cop genre in the era of Black Lives Matter, it is surely this double act, and we must look forward to the announcement that shooting has begun.</p>"

This week sees the premiere of When We Rise on ABC, a well-pedigreed docudrama series about the fight for queer rights from Milk writer and LGBT advocate Dustin Lance Black, with additional star power from Guy Pearce and Whoopi Goldberg, to name just two of the ensemble. Fox tackles Black Lives Matter and the police violence epidemic next month with Shots Fired, a 10-part miniseries about a North Carolina town rocked by a racially charged shooting. ABC\u2019s Black-ish has consistently engaged with the uglier aspects of the black experience in America, and touched a nerve last year with an episode that also dealt with police brutality on black bodies. In an era of safe spaces, network TV\u2019s preparing for some difficult discussions.</p> <p>Ever since HBO declared themselves separate from TV, premium cable has been the province of the bold and the envelope-pushing. It\u2019s not as if the major networks are only waking up to the notion of socially conscious writing now \u2013 Norman Lear built an empire around shows willing to speak to the most pressing matters of his day, from race relations on Sanford and Son to abortion on Maude. But without the content restrictions of the major networks and their fickle advertisers, shows on HBO and Showtime could more freely explore such thorny subjects. On networks, they were usually constrained to \u201cvery special episodes\u201d, where they could be handled in a contained, often overtly preachy capacity. Law and Order: SVU, for instance, has made a habit of ripping their plotlines from headlines. When they ran their Black Lives Matter episode in October 2015, however, audiences reacted negatively to the show\u2019s cursory treatment of its sensitive material.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwvgMNE9ozg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UwvgMNE9ozg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In this era of social unrest, audiences have begun to demand art that speaks more frankly and directly to major concerns. Programs such as When We Rise and Shots Fired, as well as some shows infiltrating basic cable (Ryan Murphy recently announced that the next season of American Horror Story would detail the waking nightmare of the 2016 presidential election), foreground their issues instead of writing around them. As much as network offerings have touched upon the major crises of their time, that\u2019s been the full extent \u2013 touching upon, and little more. In an interview with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/black-ish-boss-police-brutality-869397\">the Hollywood Reporter</a> about Black-ish\u2019s Black Lives Matter episode, creator Kenya Barris said: \u201cWell, my hopes are that it starts a great conversation and, at the same time, makes people laugh and think. My fear is: I don\u2019t what to piss anyone off. I don\u2019t want to politicize the show \u2026 It\u2019s politically adjacent.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/17/big-film-directors-turn-to-tv-shows\">That auteur do it: can big name directors continue to thrive on the small screen?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With a run time beyond a single episode and a firmer commitment to their causes, this upcoming wave of issue-driven series will be able to actually have the conversations that other shows aim to start. Any subject worth delving into contains far more complexity and nuance than could be conceivably squeezed into a half-hour, and these new shows can cover a wider breadth of discourse. Dustin Lance Black expressed the heightened ambition of When We Rise<em> </em>in a recent interview with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/arts/television/when-we-rise-abc-dustin-lance-black.html?_r=0\">the New York Times</a>, saying: \u201cWe did not create this series for half a nation. I believe that most Americans, including Americans who voted for Donald Trump, will fall in love with these real-life families and absolutely relate to their stories when they tune in \u2026 We are in a period of backlash right now. I would give anything for this to be less topical. But this series shows [queer] history is a pendulum, not a straight line.\u201d</p> <p>Partisan times call for television unafraid to make a principled stand, and the box-office success of politically charged films such as Hidden Figures suggests that there may be a little money in it too. What executives once considered too touchy for the broad platform of network TV, viewers have now declared too vital to go unremarked upon. Perhaps audiences have grown more daring, or they\u2019re just tired of the mealy-mouthed talk-arounds filling their airwaves. Either way, network TV \u2013 the most popular, readily accessible art form \u2013 has doubled down on its utility as a public forum. Bring the burning questions of the day home, and they can no longer be ignored.</p>"

     "body": "<p>In the opening to his <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1962/11/17/letter-from-a-region-in-my-mind\">1962 New Yorker essay Letter from a Region in My Mind</a>, James Baldwin remembers walking around his neighbourhood of Harlem as a 14-year-old, wondering if his fate would trap him there. \u201cWhat I saw around me that summer in Harlem was what I had always seen,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNothing had changed.\u201d More than 50 years on, Baldwin\u2019s words and philosophy have travelled thousands of miles from 110th street. His public image has been on a journey, from literary sensation with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/15/fiction.jamesbaldwin\">debut novel Go Tell It on the Mountain</a> in 1952 to his searing non-fiction work in the 60s that saw him revered as one of America\u2019s most prominent public intellectuals. Thirty years since he died of stomach cancer in 1987, an expat in the south of France, there is reinvigorated interest in Baldwin and his ideas. February sees the release of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/20/i-am-not-your-negro-review-james-baldwin-raoul-peck\">I Am Not Your Negro</a>, a documentary by Haitian director Raoul Peck that takes Baldwin\u2019s final, unfinished project \u2013 a book about the lives and murders of his friends Malcolm X, Martin Luther King and Medgar Evers \u2013 as a starting point, before analysing Baldwin\u2019s sometimes strained and difficult relationship with the civil rights movement. In March, Taschen will publish a special edition of The Fire Next Time with images from Life magazine photographer Steve Schapiro.</p> <p>Peck\u2019s film is the latest in a string of events and retrospectives that have put Baldwin back in the public imagination. The ball began rolling in 2014 with Columbia University\u2019s year-long programme pegged to his 90th birthday. Since then, there have been film festivals, exhibitions dedicated to Baldwin, and musical theatre inspired by his writing. As the Black Lives Matter protests unfolded around the US, there was a collection of writing \u2013 including an entry from the Pulitzer winner Isabel Wilkerson \u2013 which took inspiration from Baldwin. His work has been used to explain everything from <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2017/02/07/james-baldwin-trump-america/llUJPyDMyquVGHH5NX872H/story.html\">Trump</a> to <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2017/01/05/new-strangers-old-strangers-james-baldwin-haunts-the-dylann-roof-sentencing-hearing/\">Dylann Roof and the Charleston church shooting</a>. Then, in 2015, came Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s bestseller turned must-read commentary on contemporary race relations in America, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/08/between-the-world-and-me-sukhdev-sandhu-review\">Between The World And Me</a>, which was<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/james-baldwin-tanehisi-coates/399413/\"> inspired by Baldwin\u2019s own essay collection, The Fire Next Time</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1296f667ff6975596b11651fb82678793150617b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1296f667ff6975596b11651fb82678793150617b/0_0_1990_2682/742.jpg\" alt=\"James Baldwin at a London book launch in 1972.\" width=\"742\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Baldwin at a London book launch in 1972.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Baldwin scholar, professor of English at Yale and author <a href=\"http://www.carylphillips.com/biography.html\">Caryl Phillips,</a> the return of Baldwin to mainstream thinking isn\u2019t surprising at all. For him the big issues concerning American life now \u2013 the rise of crude, racially charged politics, killings of unarmed black men by the police, an apathetic public \u2013 repeat a history from which Baldwin\u2019s critiques still offer some solace. \u201cPeople are looking for someone who can articulate these issues,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cI think the person who has probably articulated what it means to be an American and what it means to be black, with more eloquence than anybody else in the last century, is Baldwin.\u201d</p> <p>For Peck, Baldwin\u2019s writing has lasted because it was so ahead of its time. It looked beyond the binary racial politics of 1950s and 60s America, toward a future that could genuinely be called post-racial. \u201cHe always writes from the point of view that was not only politically right, but from a humanistic point of view \u2013 it was never just about race for him.\u201d</p> <p>Phillips agrees: \u201cIt would have pleased him greatly to see Obama in the White House. He\u2019s a man who comes out of what Baldwin would have recognised as the true crucible of American life, which is fusion and hybridity. People coming together from different backgrounds to make a new country. That\u2019s what he was saying, and that didn\u2019t go over well with the clumsy racialised politics of the times.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe had the longer view,\u201d says Peck. \u201cIt was about the legacy.\u201d</p> <p>That legacy is what\u2019s at the heart of Peck\u2019s documentary. He carefully illustrates how Baldwin is still relevant to contemporary America. By switching black and white footage of protests from the 60s into colour, and contemporary colour footage from Ferguson into black and white, Peck makes those events interchangeable. Those images, combined with Baldwin\u2019s words read by Samuel L Jackson, affirm Baldwin\u2019s status not only as a visionary writer, but a philosopher we can still turn to.</p> <p>During a period when police shootings of unarmed black men and women are under the microscope, Baldwin\u2019s writing about the creation of \u201cthe nigger\u201d as a way to justify the subjugation of African-America still feels applicable. His theory that segregation of both physical and mental spaces is America\u2019s biggest hurdle rings true with parallel, unequal systems composed along racial lines \u2013 for housing, religion and education \u2013 is still on the national agenda. Baldwin, a gay black man writing about interracial relationships in the 50s, wrestled with identity politics at a time when intersectionality was a word most people would think referred to the highway code.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f093697275a50e40582d350e00e4939288d4b17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f093697275a50e40582d350e00e4939288d4b17/0_0_5550_3678/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Baldwin at home in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France, in 1979.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Baldwin at home in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France, in 1979.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ralph Gatti/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Peck wanted to show how Baldwin fits perfectly into contemporary life. \u201c[I wanted to] remind people that this man has given us all the instruments we need already, and, connecting it to Ferguson, which was happening when I was working on the film, it was like history catching up with the film. My intention was to bring his work to the forefront again. It was never intended to be a historical piece.\u201d</p> <p>But there was a time when Baldwin was savaged by his peers, publicly attacked by the more militant black leaders of the time, among them Eldridge Cleaver (whose <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/breaking-into-james-baldwins-house\">criticism was dripping in homophobia</a>) and Amiri Baraka, who saw his integrationist stance as compromised and weak.

But Adama didn\u2019t have his ID on him and tried to run. Hours later, he was dead in police custody.</p> <p>The unexplained circumstances of Adama\u2019s death, the allegations of a state cover-up and his family\u2019s fight for justice has made this one of France\u2019s most high-profile cases of alleged police brutality.</p> <p>The shadow of Traor\u00e9\u2019s death has hung over the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/08/12-arrested-as-french-youths-clash-with-police-on-estates-near-paris\">protests and riots</a> this week on high-rise estates around Paris after another case pushed alleged police violence into the spotlight ahead of this spring\u2019s French presidential election campaign.

He hoped to calm unrest, but sporadic clashes have continued on other estates. The far-right Front National\u2019s presidential candidate, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/marine-le-pen\">Marine Le Pen</a>, who is expected to make it to the final presidential runoff in May, has large electoral support among police and said her principle was to \u201csupport the police\u201d unless the justice system proved a crime had taken place. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/29/french-socialists-leftwing-rebel-benoit-hamon-elysee-manuel-valls-francois-hollande-presidency\">Beno\u00eet Hamon</a>, the Socialist presidential candidate said it could no longer be tolerated that \u201cfamilies fear for their children\u2019s safety if they are stopped by police\u201d.</p> <p>On 19 July last year, when Adama Traor\u00e9\u2019s family heard he had been arrested, they grew increasingly worried. His mother went to the police station and was given conflicting stories. One officer told her that he was in hospital, another said that he was fine and promised to give him the sandwiches that she had prepared for him. Eventually she was told that visiting hours were over and that she had to return the next day.</p> <p>His mother stood outside the police station with one of her younger sons, Yacouba, crying in the dark. It was 10pm and no one had heard from Adama in over five hours. They watched the flashing lights of police cars drive past them in and out of the station until Yacouba had had enough and put his foot out to hold open the gate. </p> <p>A police officer told him to move but he refused, demanding news about his brother. The police relented and took them both inside. \u201cIf we tell you what has happened, we want you to stay calm,\u201d the police officer told them. \u201cBut Adama is dead.\u201d</p> <p>Yacouba lashed out and had to be restrained. He and his mother were teargassed by the police. Mrs Traor\u00e9 was told that her son had died of a heart attack and a serious blood infection. They said that he had been drinking and smoking cannabis. \u201cThe doctor came and sat next to me and said: \u2018Madame, you can\u2019t see your son\u2019,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201c\u2019He has bled from his nose and mouth, it\u2019s not something you need to see.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The next day, as the media started relaying the official version of the story \u2013 that a young man had died of a heart attack in police custody \u2013 Traor\u00e9\u2019s family and friends staged a peaceful protest outside the police station where he had been taken. They didn\u2019t believe that he had died of a heart attack and were looking for answers. Police used teargas to disperse them.</p> <p>The family\u2019s suspicions grew when the authorities told them: \u201cAs you\u2019re Muslim, and we know you like to bury your bodies quickly, we\u2019ve taken the liberty of phoning Roissy [airport] and Air France and the body can be repatriated to Mali tomorrow.\u201d They even offered to arrange passports for any family members who didn\u2019t have them, relatives said. But they weren\u2019t leaving: Adama was not known to have been ill and they wanted a second autopsy.</p> <p>The authorities again insisted on trying to deliver the body to the family, but the family knew if they accepted it, they wouldn\u2019t be allowed another autopsy. \u201cWhen the body arrived, in a gesture that felt really violent for us, we refused it,\u201d Traor\u00e9\u2019s older sister, Assa, told the Guardian.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1b0487a480914eb31e491bb506977e485cf6e31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1b0487a480914eb31e491bb506977e485cf6e31/0_182_4048_2429/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adama\u2019s sister Assa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adama\u2019s sister, Assa, looks on in front of a French riot police officer during a demonstration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominique Faget/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second autopsy revealed Traor\u00e9 had died of asphyxiation. Toxicology reports for cannabis and alcohol came back negative. The family insisted that someone, somewhere, had lied about what happened that night.</p> <p>A senior firefighter later <a href=\"http://abonnes.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2016/09/14/adama-traore-le-pompier-qui-contredit-les-gendarmes_4997787_1653578.html \">told the gendarmerie inquiry</a> that when he arrived to resuscitate Traor\u00e9, he found he had not been placed in the recovery position but was lying face-down on the ground in handcuffs, with no one helping him \u2013 a statement that contradicted the gendarmes\u2019 accounts. One of the gendarmes said Traor\u00e9 had told the police he couldn\u2019t breathe, but officers told the firefighter they thought he was faking it. The gendarmes at first refused to un-cuff him saying that he was violent. </p> <p>Asked about the case in parliament last year, the then interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said only that he supported the police\u2019s work and \u201ccouldn\u2019t accept the constant blaming\u201d of officers.</p> <p>An investigation into the events surrounding Traor\u00e9\u2019s death is ongoing. But he was not the first person to die in police custody in France. No official figures are kept on the number of people killed or injured by police or gendarmes, but <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2009/04/france-police-above-law-20090402/\">Amnesty International</a> has warned of what it called \u201ca pattern of <em tabindex=\"-1\">de facto</em> impunity\u201d with regard to law enforcement officials in France. Campaign groups and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://abonnes.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2014/11/26/en-france-le-grand-flou-des-violences-policieres_4529111_4355770.html\">media </a>estimates suggest there are between 10 and 15 deaths a year linked to the police in France.</p> <p>For decades, riots and social unrest on France\u2019s high-rise suburban estates have been linked to the deteriorating relationship between young people and the deeply distrusted police. </p> <p>In 2005, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/15/trial-france-racial-divide \">two teenagers,</a> Bouna Traor\u00e9, 15, and Zyed Benna, 17, were electrocuted after running away from police in the Paris suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois in 2005, triggering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/16/france-racism-immigration-sarkozy\">the worst rioting in France for 40 years</a>. They had been walking home from a football match when they crossed paths with a police van. An inquiry found they had committed no crime, but had instinctively begun to flee when they saw the police. The police chased them until they hid in a power transformer where they were electrocuted and died. It took 10 years, and much legal wrangling, for the case to come to court. The two French officers accused of failing to help the boys were <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/18/french-police-cleared-in-teenagers-deaths-that-sparked-riots\">cleared</a>.</p> <p>Not every example of alleged police brutality in France makes the news, but Adama Traor\u00e9\u2019s case has become symbolic after years of alleged brutality and little or no action by the state. </p> <p>Assa Traor\u00e9, Adama\u2019s 31-year-old older sister, a teacher with three children, has led the campaign and quickly become a figurehead. In November she said in an interview on French television that the centre-right mayor of Beaumont-sur-Oise, Nathalie Groux had \u201cchosen her side\u201d and that was \u201cthe side of the police, that is to say, that of police brutality\u201d. Groux threatened to sue Assa for \u20ac30,000 (\u00a325,000) in damages for defamation.</p> <p>\u201cI decided with my brothers and other people from Beaumont to go to the local council meeting,\u201d Assa told the Guardian. \u201cWhen we arrived we were greeted by around 50 police officers,\u201d she said. Dozens of supporters turned up and were refused entry to the meeting, which is usually open to the public. Police used teargas to push people back and Assa announced that they would return to the next council meeting with even more people.</p> <p>When the family returned to their neighbourhood, there were dozens of armed police waiting for them. Videos showed non-lethal weapons being used and scuffles between locals and the police.</p> <p>Six days later, on the day of the second council meeting, police came to arrest Assa\u2019s brothers Bagui and Youssouf for allegedly verbally and physically assaulting the police when they had tried to gain access to the council meeting the week before. They were refused bail and went on trial three weeks later.</p> <p>The eight police officers testifying sat together in the courtroom and the 11 witnesses for the defence waited in a separate room. French newspaper Le Monde reported that the defence had \u201chighlighted contradictions in the testimonies of the forces of order\u201d, but both brothers were found guilty. Youssouf was given a suspended sentence of three months and Bagui was sentenced to eight months in prison and banned from living in Beaumont for two years. They were fined a total of \u20ac7,000.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the family and campaigners hosted a sold-out \u201cJustice for Adama\u201d concert in Paris with the help of several well-known French musicians including Youssoupha and Sofiane. That same night, the 22-year-old Theo was arrested in Aulnay-sous-Bois and an officer charged with his rape. </p> <p>This week a group of artists, sports stars, academics and celebrities signed <a href=\"http://www.liberation.fr/france/2017/02/14/mort-d-adama-traore-si-on-se-tait-c-est-toute-notre-societe-qui-se-salit_1548531\">an open letter in the newspaper Lib\u00e9ration</a> for justice in the Adama Traor\u00e9 case. They wrote: \u201cWe refuse to accept that a growing part of the French population is abandoned by the republic, and we demand the strictest impartiality of the state when forces of order go beyond the law.\u201d<br></p>"

     "body": "<p>The Good Wife\u2019s creators, Robert and Michelle King, have never been afraid of silence. Their heroine, Alicia, mostly operated via crisply disdainful turns on her work-appropriate heels, the careful raising and putting down of a large glass of red wine or a single styptic blink when faced with another sudden revelation that was about to rain down disaster on her professional or personal life (most often both).</p> <p>The Good Fight, their spin-off, arrives a year after seven more-or-less superb series of Alicia\u2019s adventures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jun/23/goodbye-to-the-good-wife-a-miracle-of-the-small-screen\">came to an end</a>, and takes things to the next level; in the opening 30-second scene, Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) stares in wordless horror at her television screen as Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration takes place. Then she stands up, smooths down her skirt and exits, still silently, stage left.</p> <p>We know, then, from the beginning that we are in safe hands \u2013 that the Kings have lost none of their confidence and that their new series will continue at least two of the traditions that made The Good Wife great: a quick responsiveness to real-world events (the pilot was hastily rewritten in the wake of Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat) and its willingness to treat its audience like intelligent adults who have attention spans beyond nanoseconds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd34232599af63d766fd6796a1a442f08dcea486\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd34232599af63d766fd6796a1a442f08dcea486/0_0_3000_1919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christine Baranski and Cush Jumbo in The Good Fight.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"640\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christine Baranski and Cush Jumbo in The Good Fight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Harbron/CBS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the opening scene, events unfold at a rapid clip. No sooner has Diane told her firm that she is retiring (and about to plough her life savings into a new home and life in France) than her friend and accountant is arrested for running a Madoff-like pyramid scheme. Her money is gone. Her firm won\u2019t rescind her resignation and she is considered toxic by all the other big players. She is eventually offered partnership at an African-American practice \u2013 where Lucca (Cush Jumbo), erstwhile associate of Diane\u2019s old firm, now works \u2013 that specialises in representing victims in police brutality cases. \u201cYou can be our diversity hire,\u201d the firm\u2019s swashbuckling head, Adrian Boseman (Delroy Lindo), tells her.</p> <p>Diane takes young lawyer Maia, who is her accountant\u2019s daughter and Diane\u2019s goddaughter, with her. Maia\u2019s world has also collapsed in the wake of her father\u2019s arrest. She is bombarded by death and rape threats from those he has bankrupted.</p> <p>Over the next few episodes, The Good Fight takes on all comers. The weekly cases examine the morality of aspects of the fight against terrorism (a doctor is arrested for assisting via Skype at an operation in a Syrian hospital), the generation of fake news (Maia is suddenly the centre of prurient and libellous online stories that have no origin she can trace), the ramifications of new reproductive technologies, and corporate exploitation of low-paid workers (a class action suit grows out of pro bono work for a man who was forced to sign a confession that he stole from his employer), all against the ongoing police brutality cases being prosecuted by the firm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"05b141a0193ae603a4d1dd0b6977df7f2e4476df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05b141a0193ae603a4d1dd0b6977df7f2e4476df/0_0_3000_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Delroy Lindo as Adrian Boseman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swashbuckling ...

Class, wealth and, of course, racial prejudices \u2013 and the complacencies and sensitivities they bring \u2013 are all present as Maia and Diane negotiate their new worlds in which so many advantages, earned and unearned, have been stripped from them. It resonates beautifully with Trumpworld without ever overplaying its hand. There\u2019s a wonderful moment in episode four when Diane is left powerless on the stand in court by someone in authority flat-out lying about an encounter in a way that should, to anyone with a vestige of normal conscience or even caution, be impossible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/17/the-good-fight-review-wife-spin-off-christine-baranski\">The Good Fight review \u2013 sleek Good Wife spin-off offers Alicia-free fun</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is also a bulwark against that world\u2019s more regressive tendencies. Its three leads are female \u2013 one is 64 and one is mixed race. None of these facts should be remarkable, but they all are, as is the number of black actors the show has and the fact that not one character on the show \u2013 even just a few episodes in \u2013 is a reductive, one-note role. No one is a paragon of virtue, or a bitch, or a villain (with the possible exception of Mike Kresteva (Matthew Perry), Alicia\u2019s nemesis in The Good Wife who returns to wreak more havoc), competent or incompetent, but can be all of them in turn and to different degrees. Just like in The Good Wife, just like in real life.</p> <p>The Good Fight weaves all its elements together as masterfully as its predecessor did and looks set to deliver 10 quality episodes and more in the second series, which has just been commissioned. It is, alas, also bringing Elsbeth Tascioni back, whose popularity in The Good Wife always confounded me, not just because she was so profoundly irritating a character in her own right, but also because she seemed to have wandered in from an entirely different show. Ah well. All great showrunners have their blind spots, and this seems to be the Kings\u2019 only one. Long may they fight on. </p> <ul> <li><em>The Good Fight begins Thursday 30 March, 9pm, More4</em></li> </ul>"

Now I think about us as a collective, as a people and history joined together.\u201d Onat, 41, is a classically trained ballet-dancer-turned-artist with a history for making heavy political weather. A feminist current runs through her most provocative pieces \u2013 multimedia installations themed around sexual abuse, rape, child brides, women treated as second-class citizens \u2013 but her next project is set to be her most forceful yet. Onat is taking on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan\">President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan</a>.</p> <p>Over the course of six months, she has secretly gathered a 330-page internal police log detailing more than 2,000 cases of state-sanctioned violence against Turkish citizens over the last 11 months; she will be exposing every detail in a performance piece at this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/venice-biennale\">Venice Biennale</a>.

It is superficial calm.\u201d</p> <p>Onat is at pains to emphasise the crucial point in history in which Turkey has arrived (\u201cit is a crisis; there has been an intellectual cleansing\u201d). The country has been under a state of emergency following last summer\u2019s mercilessly bloody attempted coup, but, of course, the <a href=\"https://turkeypurge.com/\">numbers alone do the work</a>: more than 130,000 dissidents \u2013 state officials, teachers, bureaucrats \u2013 have been sacked; more than 95,000 have been detained, with more than 47,000 arrested; more than 7,000 academics and 4,000 judges and prosecutors have been purged from their posts. On top of this, 149 media outlets have been shut down and 231 journalists imprisoned. When we meet, Onat is tying up loose ends, preparing for exile; her husband and two teenage children have already left the country.</p> <p>\u201cEvery policeman in Turkey has the right to kill. Putting on that uniform dehumanises them \u2013 there is no empathy. I have always fought for women\u2019s rights but now it feels like there is no time to separate.

It is shocking, and for women it is worse. They have been erasing our rights for years.\u201d Later, in a cafe on the Asian side of the city, Onat introduces me to her friends, fellow artists who don\u2019t dare speak out and communist activists who can barely keep quiet. \u201cMarital rape, abortions, the right for men to marry 11-year-old children, domestic violence \u2013 we have fallen backwards as a country,\u201d says Onat. \u201cAll religion is patriarchal,\u201d adds actor Levent \u00dcz\u00fcmc\u00fc, who has nearly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/leventuzumcu?lang=en\">four million followers on Twitter</a> and is repeatedly asked for selfies where we sit. \u201cI\u2019m an atheist and, before, we could live together, side by side.

Barry Jenkins\u2019s <a href=\"http://moonlight.movie/\"><em>Moonlight</em></a> is the coming-of-age tale of Chiron, an African American boy dealing with his sexuality. It\u2019s based on the play <em>In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue </em>by award-winning writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/21/moonlight-film-tarell-alvin-mccraney-interview\">Tarell Alvin McCraney</a> and is all but certain of Oscar nominations when they\u2019re announced on Tuesday.

I had a family member who was addicted to crack, like Paula [Chiron\u2019s biological mother, played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/naomie-harris\">Naomie Harris</a>].

The 37-year-old was shot several times when the gunman sprayed bullets into the Kansas City home where she and her three children were sleeping. The gunman remains free. Mon\u00e1e, a long-time advocate of tighter gun control and an active voice in the <a href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.com/\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement pauses, and says quietly: \u201cMy family is heartbroken and I\u2019m still devastated. My cousin was an innocent mother of three children. How? How can this be real life?\u201d She continues: \u201cWe have to do something about gun laws. And we also have to do something about police brutality towards African American people.\u201d She points out that they are two different issues, but that \u201cwe need more allies. People need to continue to speak out about the way African American people are being treated. An injustice to one black man or woman is an injustice to everybody.\u201d</p> <p>Mon\u00e1e has led marches for Black Lives Matter, performed at a concert in aid of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/flint-water-crisis\">water crisis in Flint, Michigan</a>, alongside Stevie Wonder last year, and released a protest song, \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d, in October in response to the police brutality. Unsurprisingly, she is no fan of Donald Trump. \u201cMillennials will not be silenced \u2013 we\u2019re the powerhouse now. We\u2019re not going to let those who want to \u2018make America great again\u2019 truly take over. Because what Trump means by \u2018making America great again\u2019 is oppressing women, oppressing minorities, creating hate. We\u2019re not allowing him to run the world, even though he thinks he is.\u201d</p> <p>I ask her how she feels she can make a difference personally. Mon\u00e1e takes a deep, considered breath and says calmly: \u201cMusic is my weapon. I won\u2019t remain silent. Michelle Obama \u2013 having been our First Lady for eight years \u2013 set an example of how we need to be. We need to be visible and we need to be loud. We\u2019re not objects.\u201d For the first time during the interview, Mon\u00e1e shows more than a crack of emotion \u2013 not much \u2013 but enough to know that the sunglasses stay on for a reason.</p> <p>Moonlight<em> opens in the UK on 17 February</em></p>"

Fleeing from the party, 16-year-old Starr is led to apparent safety by her friend Khalil. Shortly after, their car is pulled over by a police officer. What happens next crystallises the Black Lives Matter movement and indeed, the whole debate about race in America. The unarmed Khalil is murdered \u2013 shot at point blank range by the man Starr refers to from this moment on as \u201cOfficer One-Fifteen\u201d.

The family own a pet dog, Brickz, and Starr gets to wear the expensive name-brand trainers of her choice. Starr\u2019s parents have sent her to a school in the suburbs dominated by white middle-class students. Unbeknown to her father, she is dating Chris, a white boy from school who can recite the lyrics to the opening credits of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/17/the-fresh-prince-of-bel-air-when-the-mainstream-met-afrocentric-style\"><em>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</em></a>.

There is one chilling scene where Starr witnesses a police officer, in a revenge stop, force her father to lie on the ground as he searches him. \u201cFace down,\u201d the policeman yells, his hands never too far away from his gun, humiliating his victim even though Big Mav offers to show his ID and addresses the officer as \u201cSir\u201d.</p> <p>Finally, she summons up the courage to make a statement to a grand jury. The world outside waits to learn if the officer who killed Khalil will face charges.

And, as any woman who uses her voice for work \u2013 in, for example, a podcast \u2013 will tell you, men are not shy about complaining.

Longworth has continued with that big-picture approach (no pun intended) in her series on the anti-communist blacklists of the 1950s, and, right now, her three-parter on the life and death of Marilyn Monroe. Longworth writes and narrates all the episodes herself, with only the occasional guest. Each one is a masterclass in structure and the careful use of detail. Plus, you\u2019ll learn a lot you didn\u2019t know about a lot of famous people.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.scummymummies.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Scummy Mummies</strong></a></h2> <p>If you took the bodies-are-gross-but-funny ethos of the early feminist websites \u2013 think the original Jezebel \u2013 and applied them to a parenting blog, you would get something like Scummy Mummies. Every episode of Helen Thorn and Ellie Gibson\u2019s gleefully profane take on pregnancy and motherhood involves a lot of swearing and cackling. In an era where parenting is often fetishised and sanitised for readers of parenting blogs, their impious attitude towards it all is near-revolutionary. Listen to <a href=\"http://www.scummymummies.com/podcast/episode-38-call-the-midwife-clemmie-hooper-returns\" title=\"\">the midwife episode</a> and marvel at their explicit discussion of the biological reality of being pregnant and giving birth. It is nice to have such honesty come out from behind closed doors. Also, once you hear about how one of the hosts has a rare condition in that episode, you\u2019ll be hooked.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.apmreports.org/in-the-dark\" title=\"\"><strong>In the Dark</strong></a></h2> <p>Madeleine Baran\u2019s first season followed the case of Jacob Wetterling, a long-missing child in Minnesota whose disappearance was solved just a few weeks before Baran\u2019s first season began airing. Another breed of podcaster might have been disappointed by the way this ruined her dramatic suspense, but Baran was interested in something wider than a whodunnit. To find out what it was, you\u2019ll have to binge-listen to the first season (in order). The series is perfectly constructed, each episode opening a new avenue of the mystery. <a href=\"http://www.apmreports.org/in-the-dark\" title=\"\">Baran has promised there will be season two and h</a>er thoughtful, careful style makes her a uniquely empathic entry into the true-crime genre.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/08/women-challenging-patriarchy-one-podcast-at-time\">Women challenging the patriarchy \u2013 one podcast at a time</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/melaninmillennials\" title=\"\"><strong>Melanin Millennials</strong></a></h2> <p>\u201cMillennials\u201d has become a kind of modern swearword, a slur directed at people in their early 20s. But here, it\u2019s an asset. Anyone who was once a smart, sceptical and young woman won\u2019t be able to help but fall in love with London\u2019s Imrie and Satia. Partly inspired by the example of BuzzFeed\u2019s Another Round in the US, the pair simply chat for an hour or so about whatever subjects happen to be on their mind \u2013 sometimes it is the latest issue being raised by #BlackLivesMatter movement, sometimes it\u2019s relationships; other times it\u2019s <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/melaninmillennials/how-to-get-away-with-rape\" title=\"\">rape culture</a>. The intelligence of Imrie and Satia\u2019s discussions puts a lot of regular BBC and NPR commentators to shame.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78ef14c13226cf3e40ac474aad6808dc17d26e0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78ef14c13226cf3e40ac474aad6808dc17d26e0c/152_0_2412_1446/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kelly McEvers \u2026 Embedded.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kelly McEvers \u2026 Embedded.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amanda Edwards/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/shows/deathsexmoney/\" title=\"\"><strong>Death, Sex and Money</strong></a></h2> <p>There is something about Anna Sale\u2019s interview style that lets her guests open up as if they have known her (and her thousands of listeners) for ever. The topics are all there in the title, and though, in other hands, this could have become sentimental fast, Sale always manages to keep things above water. Sometimes, she explores the stories of ordinary people, such as the woman who discovered that <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/dead-people-dont-have-any-secrets/\" title=\"\">her dying husband was having an affair</a>, but never got a chance to confront him about it. At other times, she interviews celebrities, as with her excellent interview featuring <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/how-ellen-burstyn-learned-survival/\" title=\"\">Ellen Burstyn</a>. But any tears Sale might inspire feel cathartic \u2013 and fully earned. Barbara Walters wishes she were this good.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510311/embedded\" title=\"\"><strong>Embedded</strong></a></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Most journalism is done quickly and cheaply these days. Few reporters get to do what Kelly McEvers does in every episode of Embedded: go deep into a story and tease out what is really happening. This season, the show is exploring police-shooting videos. And, even though those videos have been on the front pages of American newspapers and websites for years, you can learn a lot from getting into these weeds. While McEvers and crew are sceptical of police narratives, they are also interested in the reason the police have been so trigger-happy. In the latest episode, they focused on a time when a cop exercised self-control and stopped himself from shooting a suspected murderer.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.callyourgirlfriend.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Call Your Girlfriend</strong></a></h2> <p>In what sounds like an unlikely premise, Ann Friedman and Aminatou Sow took their real-life long-distance friendship update calls and turned them into a podcast. But the pair are so charming that each episode goes down like a long glass of wine after a hard day. Friedman and Sow are both politics and pop-culture junkies, so in a single conversation like the one they have on the latest episode of the show, they will lead into a conversation about Neil Gorsuch\u2019s supreme court confirmation hearings with, \u201cHi, Boober, how\u2019s your day going?\u201d (Sow, greeting Friedman.) The intimacy of the conversation is part of the appeal \u2013 the tangle of personal and political in this friendship is so easy to relate to.</p>"

A recent Bureau of Land Management (BLM) <a href=\"http://www.sltrib.com/news/4886786-155/report-on-utah-blm-agent-at\">ethics scandal</a> involving tickets for the popular Burning Man festival<strong> </strong>could further hinder prosecutors in the high-profile trial, which began this week in Las Vegas federal court.</p> <p>The case stems from the Bundy family\u2019s infamous 2014 standoff with federal agents at their ranch in Bunkerville, Nevada. The 70-year-old patriarch became a hero to conservative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/29/oregon-militia-standoff-bundy-family\">cowboys in the west</a> when he publicly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/11/cliven-bundy-arrested-charges-oregon-milita-standoff\">refused to pay grazing fees</a> to the federal government, arguing that the BLM has no right to regulate lands by his property. </p> <p>When federal agents attempted to seize his cattle, hundreds of supporters, some heavily armed, flocked to the ranch to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/19/nevada-armed-militia-cliven-bundy-victory-federal-government\">defend the family</a>. The government eventually retreated and only filed conspiracy, firearms and assault charges two years later \u2013 after his sons were involved in a similar standoff in Oregon. </p> <p>In January 2016, Ammon and Ryan Bundy spearheaded a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/oregon-militia-standoff-trial-begins-ammon-ryan-bundy\">takeover of the Malheur national wildlife refuge</a> to protest the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/17/oregon-militia-standoff-occupation-dwight-steven-hammond\">government\u2019s treatment of Oregon ranchers</a>, leading to federal conspiracy charges against more than two-dozen participants. In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/28/oregon-militia-standoff-bundy-trial-not-guilty-reactions\">surprise verdict</a> in October, a jury found the Bundy brothers and their supporters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/27/oregon-militia-standoff-bundy-brothers-not-guilty-trial\">not guilty</a>, which some say could foreshadow the government\u2019s failure in Nevada.</p> <p>A total of 17 men are preparing for trial in Las Vegas over their roles in the Bunkerville case, including Cliven, Ammon and Ryan and their brothers Mel and Davey.
