St Clair said she was dismissed by a 911 dispatcher. She said an officer at the local precinct told her to<strong> </strong>\u201cbe grateful for those men and they were indeed keeping me safe\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>St Clair\u2019s boyfriend John Entwistle, 33, said one of the on-duty officers he spoke with said he was friends with some of the armed locals who had gathered in Fishtown. \u201cHe said they knew each other through local athletic leagues or whatever,\u201d Entwistle said. \u201cAnd when you saw them, there were smiles. It was friendly.\u201d</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for the Philadelphia police department told the Guardian that the incident is being investigated. In a news conference on Tuesday, police commissioner Danielle Outlaw said her department does not support the group, which had congregated just outside the 26th police district on Monday night.</p> \n<p>Goldbloom said it was disheartening, though not entirely surprising, to witness the scene in Fishtown, a long-standing white-majority neighborhood in the northeast of the city. \u201cIt\u2019s weird because I\u2019m fighting with my own neighborhood,\u201d he said. The historically working-class Irish-Catholic neighborhood has recently seen an influx of new, younger residents move in.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cI am absolutely not surprised this happened,\u201d said Noel Cazenave, a sociologist at the University of Connecticut and author of Killing African Americans: Police and Vigilante Violence as a Racial Control Mechanism.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cRace relations have been very intense in Philadelphia,\u201d said Cazenave, who lived in the city for 13 years. \u201cWhen my family and I drove down to try to find housing in Philadelphia, let\u2019s just say we had some interesting encounters in the north-east.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0617b81f-5431-457d-b963-3e057fc1b578\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gfIWyPgE_E0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Amid nationwide protests against police brutality and systemic racism against black Americans, a gathering of white vigilantes sends a chilling message. \u201cWe need to recognize that what\u2019s happening with the police and vigilantes is closely related,\u201d he said. \u201cSlave patrols and vigilante committees made the earliest roots of the American policing system.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Vigilantes and neighborhood watchers don\u2019t have to hurt or kill black people \u2013 as they did in the cases of Ahmaud Arbery and Philando Castile \u2013 in order to spark fear, Cazenave explained.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cChasing someone with golf clubs or what have you \u2013 I\u2019d say that is a form of non-lethal lynching that maintains white racial control,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sends a message that states: You\u2019re not supposed to be in this area. It\u2019s justified by the notion that black people, no matter what they\u2019re doing, are criminals.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, protesters convened outside Philadelphia\u2019s 26th police precinct, where the armed men had gathered the night before. Some residents stood across from the demonstrators, behind a line of police, saying \u201cAll lives matter,\u201d the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.&nbsp;</p>"

     "body": "<p>Grindr is removing an \u201cethnicity filter\u201d from its dating app as part of its support for the Black Lives Matter movement, the company announced on Monday.</p> <p>The controversial feature, limited to those who stump up \u00a312.99 a month for the premium version of the app, allows users to sort search results based on reported ethnicity, height, weight and other characteristics.</p> <p>In a statement <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CA51xUkH9Fy/\">posted to Instagram</a>, the company said \u201cWe stand in solidarity with the #BlackLivesMatter movement and the hundreds of thousands of queer people of color who log in to our app every day.</p> <p>\u201cWe will continue to fight racism on Grindr, both through dialogue with our community and a zero-tolerance policy for racism and hate speech on our platform. As part of this commitment, and based on your feedback, we have decided to remove the ethnicity filter from our next release.\u2063\u201d</p> <p>Grindr\u2019s filter had come under intense criticism over the weekend after&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Grindr/status/1266448252011872257\">a now-deleted tweet</a>&nbsp;from the company that read \u201cDemand Justice. #blacklivesmatter\u201d. Many condemned the company\u2019s show of solidarity as hollow when taken alongside the existence of a feature that allows users to explicitly discriminate based on race.</p> <p>The company has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/29/wltm-colour-blind-dating-app-racial-discrimination-grindr-tinder-algorithm-racism\">long maintained that the ethnicity filter</a>&nbsp;was useful for minority users who wanted to find people like themselves, rather than enforce racism.</p> <p>\u201cWe decided before we were ready to pull the plug on that, it was a conversation we wanted with our user base,\u201d Grindr\u2019s head of communications told the Guardian in 2018. \u201cWhile I believe the ethnicity filter does promote racist behaviour in the app, other minority groups use the filter because they want to quickly find other members of their minority community.\u201d</p> <p>Grindr isn\u2019t the only dating app which allows users to filter by race, but it is by far the most prominent. Racial discrimination on the app isn\u2019t simply enforced algorithmically, either; a 2015 study of Australian users found that 96% had seen at least one profile that included some form of racial discrimination, \u2018through language such as \u201cNot attracted to Asians.\u201d\u2019 One in eight of those surveyed admitted they themselves included such language.</p> <p>The announcement came on the first day of Pride month, Grindr noted. \u201cWe can still come together in the spirit of Pride, but Pride this year has an added responsibility, a shifted tone, and a new priority that will be reflected in our programming \u2013 support and solidarity for queer people of color and the #BlackLivesMatter movement.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>It\u2019s Tina I feel sorry for. This week she rang <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/lbc\">LBC</a>\u2019s breakfast show to tell host <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/nov/09/nick-ferrari-lbc-radio-daze\">Nick Ferrari</a> what toppling statues of racist Britons means to her as a British woman of African-Caribbean ancestry. Could she get her point across? Not a chance. Every time she tried to air her views, Ferrari\u2019s voice cut through hers. \u201cTina, Tina, Tina,\u201d Ferrari said in his trademark oleaginously patronising simper as if speaking to a dim child. Tina complained about him interrupting her, but Ferrari wouldn\u2019t be silenced. Taking down statues is illegal. End of. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d is a Black Lives Matter slogan. \u201cI can\u2019t get airtime\u201d might be Tina\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cTina, Tina, Tina\u201d, for me, had Thatcherite resonance. There was no alternative to her neoliberal ruin of Britain \u2013 and on the London radio station, there is no alternative to the stale pale male discourse, no airtime for BAME women\u2019s voices to be heard. There is one female presenter, the superbly intelligent Shelagh Fogarty, and one person of colour, the former Islamist who became David Cameron\u2019s anti-extremism adviser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/02/maajid-nawaz-how-a-former-islamist-became-david-camerons-anti-extremism-adviser\">Maajid Nawaz</a>, now the station\u2019s eviscerator-in-chief of dimwit callers.</p> <p>No wonder there have been reports of BAME staff, and quite possibly anyone with a social conscience at LBC, having long been sickened by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage\">Nigel Farage</a>, who has been hosting his show five days a week since 2017. They will be pleased that the former Ukip leader\u2019s toxic demagoguery has finally received its comeuppance. This happened when Farage tweeted comparing Black Lives Matter protesters in Bristol who toppled the statue of Edward Colston to the Taliban. On ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, Farage clashed with host Piers Morgan over his comments and had his microphone muted as a result. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nigel-farage-leaves-lbc-show-black-lives-matter-taliban-comments-2020-6?r=US&amp;IR=T\">Sources at LBC told Business Insider</a> that there had been \u201cso much anger\u201d among staff about the station publicly endorsing the Black Lives Matter movement \u201cwhile promoting a man that likened it to the Taliban\u201d.</p> <p>LBC has long been too cosy with Farage\u2019s agenda, right down to gleefully plugging his exclusive interview with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>. I say interview, but it was more a case of Farage kneeling down, puckering up and smooching for an hour. The first principle of political interviewing is, as Jeremy Paxman argued: \u201cWhy is this lying bastard lying to me?\u201d Farage stands for a different kind of journalism, one that led Ofcom to investigate his show and one that LBC should have dispensed with years ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d664f72f08f2f61d428b7ffb277f3370b9f9213\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d664f72f08f2f61d428b7ffb277f3370b9f9213/1189_764_3523_2114/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kindly, intelligent albeit Tory persona ...

Iain Dale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>LBC has previous in falling foul of its fetish for hiring toxic blowhards. Three years ago, hate factory Katie Hopkins <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/may/26/katie-hopkins-leaves-lbc-radio-final-solution-tweet-manchester-attack\">lost her show on the station</a> after a tweet in which she called for a \u201cfinal solution\u201d following the Manchester Arena bombing.</p> <p>This has left more responsible presenters putting out fires. A year ago, Brexiteer Trevor rang in in the small hours of the morning to ask rhetorically: \u201cWhy the hell do we need Europe when Europe is filled up with black people who are raping?\u201d \u201cAt some point,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/darren-adam/darren-adam-brands-brexiteer-racist-turbulent-row/\">retorted presenter Darren Adam</a>, \u201cpeople who say a racist thing lose the right not to describe them as racist.\u201d</p> <p>After LBC showed Farage that leave means leave, token leftwing presenter James O\u2019Brien tweeted happily that he and his colleagues had got their station back. Perhaps, but that\u2019s not good enough. One evening last week, Denise from Enfield rang in to Iain Dale\u2019s show. Dale is having a good lockdown \u2013 his ratings are up and his kindly, intelligent, albeit Tory, persona has been soothing for many of us.</p> <p>Denise rang in to tell truth to power, namely that black people don\u2019t get chances for representation on TV and radio. Dale was so impressed by her insights into race issues that he invited her to cohost a show. The result was a revelation, not least because Denise was a natural for radio: warm-voiced, kind to callers and, like a pro, very aware of the need to cut people off before the ad break.</p> <p>Mostly, though, Denise\u2019s hour on LBC was a revelation because, finally, a white man was listening to a black woman. She told Dale: \u201cI think you can have empathy for a person\u2019s situation, you can also have sympathy because most people in the world are decent in terms of the day-to-day understanding. I\u2019m sorry, Iain, but you wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Good for Dale, opening the airwaves to Denise. He will now, apparently, do a four-hour show, taking in the 6-7pm evening slot previously filled by Farage. Why don\u2019t they just let Denise replace Farage? It would be a step in the right direction.</p>"

What could be worse in Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden\u2019s philosophy than betraying your own country to a hostile foreign leader, sir?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrust me, I understand that point,\u201d Bolton stuttered before Colbert shot back: \u201cBut will you answer that question?\u201d</p> <p>Bolton explained that his view of Trump in 2016 was \u201cwe at least have to try it out\u201d \u2013 which is why he voted for him.</p> <p>But \u201chaving experienced 17 months of working with him, I can\u2019t in good conscience do that again.\u201d Bolton again confirmed, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/21/politics/john-bolton-joe-biden-2020-trump/index.html\">as he has previously</a>, that he would not vote for either Trump or Biden in November.</p> <p>\u201cI guess what\u2019s exasperating is there is absolutely nothing that Donald Trump has done that is surprising to me,\u201d Colbert responded. \u201cMy rule is, everything you think about Donald Trump is probably true. Because he\u2019s not deep enough to get your socks wet in. He\u2019s incredibly readable,\u201d which is why when he ran casinos, \u201cthe house <em>lost\u201d \u2013</em> a comment which drew a laugh from Bolton.</p> <p>But Bolton\u2019s smile darkened as Colbert continued: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to learn about him. He\u2019s essentially a boring person. How did you not know beforehand that he was just callow?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t believe it was that bad,\u201d Bolton replied. \u201cAnd I know other people say they saw it from the beginning \u2013 \u201d</p> <p>Colbert cut him off, laughing again, and asked: \u201cBut you\u2019re an international negotiator, how could you be naive? You\u2019ve dealt with the worst people in the world.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve really insulted me now by calling me naive,\u201d Bolton replied.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was possible to work with somebody,\u201d he said of Trump, because \u201csurely they would want to learn about the complexities of arms control negotiations and that sort of thing. As I detail in the book, that turned out not to be true.\u201d</p> <h2>Trevor Noah</h2> <p>And on The Daily Show, Trevor Noah investigated systemic under-representation of black people in corporate America despite a flurry of Black Lives Matter solidarity tweets and posts from companies who clearly have some internal work to do. Nike, for example, ran an ad proclaiming, \u201cDon\u2019t pretend there\u2019s not a problem in America,\u201d though all of the company\u2019s executives are white.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1275624466886860800\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">From code-switching to daily microaggressions, here\u2019s a slice of what Black people go through in corporate America: <a href=\"https://t.co/rhOFa7kvrt\">pic.twitter.com/rhOFa7kvrt</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1275624466886860800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 24, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cIf you are just some random person who has like ten followers on Twitter and you tweet Black Lives Matter, maybe that\u2019s the best you can do,\u201d said Noah. \u201cBut if you\u2019re a major corporation that hires thousands of people, you can actually show that black lives matter in a material way that goes beyond your social media feed.\u201d</p> <p>Noah thus investigated actual avenues for corporate accountability for anti-racism in a new segment called \u201c\\This Black American Life.</p> <p>\u201cDespite what your racist uncle says on Facebook, for many black Americans, getting a job is almost impossible,\u201d Noah explained, starting with getting one\u2019s foot in the door; as Pascal Desroches, chief financial officer at WarnerMedia, told CNN, white Americans are hired on potential while black Americans are hired on demonstrated accomplishment.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing I wish more people understood,\u201d said Noah. \u201cBlack people are looking for equality, not charity. They\u2019re not asking people to \u2018hire black people\u2019 just because they\u2019re black, they\u2019re asking companies to stop <em>not</em> hiring black people just because they\u2019re black.\u201d</p> <p>If black employees do get a foot in the door, Noah continued, climbing the ladder is difficult \u2013 only 3.2% of corporate executives in America are black \u2013 and one\u2019s challenges are compounded by micro-aggressions such as \u201cyou\u2019re very articulate,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re not like the others,\u201d and hair-grabbing. Such thoughtlessness is \u201cwhat you get from living in a segregated society,\u201d said Noah.</p> <p>\u201cInstead of knowing black people and black culture, you\u2019ve got white folks interacting with black people like they\u2019re making contact with ET.\u201d</p> <p>Noah ended with a message to corporate America: \u201cIf you really believe in rooting out systemic racism and supporting black lives, then I say to you: examine your own actions within your companies before history leaves you behind. Or as I would put it if I wasn\u2019t in the office: you better check yourself before you wreck yourself.\u201d</p>"

Nor has it healed or conquered the institutionalised violence and racism toward African Americans that followed their emancipation in the 1860s.\u201d</p> <p>The unrest began following an encounter between a white Minneapolis police officer and Floyd, a 46-year-old black man. After a brief struggle, the officer pinned his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd protested and pleaded that he could not breath at least 16 times before losing consciousness and dying.&nbsp;</p> <p>Protests touched off in Minneapolis and have now spread to 140 cities in all 50 US states. Most demonstrations have been peaceful, but there have also been instances of violence and looting such as the burning of a Minneapolis police precinct, damage to CNN\u2019s headquarters in Atlanta and shops being looted in New York and Los Angeles.</p> <p>Meanwhile, police and the national guard have beaten and tear gassed protestors, often when they are being peaceful, and assaulted and injured dozens of journalists.&nbsp;</p> <p>The report implores Donald Trump, as well as prominent elected and security officials, to stop courting conflict with incendiary language and threats to deploy the military to quell civil unrest.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps the most sobering political development as the protests reached the one-week mark was a growing inclination among some prominent elected and security officials to frame the civil unrest in the language of armed conflict,\u201d the report states, citing comments by Trump, who has called protesters \u201cthugs\u201d as well as&nbsp;the Ssecretary of Ddefense, Mark Esper, who has urged state governors to \u201cdominate the battlespace\u201d.</p> <p>The killing, and the Trump administration\u2019s response to the upheaval, risk further eroding the \u201cglobal standing and credibility\u201d of the US \u201cparticularly when it comes to condemning repression or brutality perpetrated by other governments\u201d, the Crisis Group said.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cSince assuming office in 2017, Trump has made much of his desire to pull the US back from overseas wars,\u201d it concludes. \u201cHe should take great pains not to act like he wants one at home.\u201d</p> <p>Police brutality toward black men and women is \u201cboth a chronic problem and a recurrent source of instability in US cities\u201d, according to the analysis, which catalogues several high-profile incidents, including the assault Rodney King in 1992, the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in 2014 and the death in custody of Freddie Gray in 2015.</p> <p>The only long-term solution is addressing the systemic racial disparities that continue to plague the nation, the report concludes.</p> <p>But in the immediate future, local authorities must ensure that \u201cjustice is done\u201d.

     "body": "<p>At the start of April, Dawn Butler was a well-liked figure in parliament and looked like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/28/labour-deputy-leader-trade-union-equality\">a strong candidate for deputy leader of the Labour party</a>. An experienced parliamentarian, 50 years old and a party member for more than 30 of them, she had been a minister in Gordon Brown\u2019s government and served in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow cabinet. In December 2009, she had been the first black woman to speak from the dispatch box. She also had strong union links, having worked for the GMB and, before that, the Public and Commercial Services Union. She had a life before \u2013 and halfway through \u2013 Westminster, working as a computer programmer and then an employment-service trainer.</p> <p>In February 2005, she stood to be a parliamentary candidate in West Ham, in the east London borough of Newham, where she was raised by her mother, who worked for the NHS, and her father, who worked on the railways. She lost that race by four votes. A month later, she went for Brent South, in north-west London, and got it, even though \u201cit had already been earmarked for Tony Blair\u2019s political adviser. That was like a red rag to a bull, wasn\u2019t it? It had already been stitched up for a bloke, so obviously I was going to go for it.\u201d That May, she won the seat in the general election.</p> <p>After boundary changes, she lost the newly minted seat of Brent Central to Sarah Teather in the 2010 Lib Dem bounce, only to be elected again \u2013 in the same constituency \u2013 in 2015, since when she has held the seat. She spent the intervening years designing learning programmes for companies and nursing her father in the last year of his life.</p> <p>On 3 April 2020, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/04/keir-starmer-wins-labour-leadership-election\">she lost the deputy leadership race to Angela Rayner</a> \u2013 about which she has views, which we will come to. Since then, she has been a backbencher, working in the same crisis conditions as everyone else. In June, <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/06/06/blame-government-coronavirus-12814284/\">she wrote an opinion piece</a> in the Metro newspaper defending the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter protests</a>. \u201cWe had 6,000 bits of communication and about 2,000 of them were hate communication,\u201d she says of the response. \u201cThere are people calling me every word you can think of \u2013 the C-word, the N-word, the B-world. People threatening to kill me. I\u2019ve been attacked on the tube. People have tried to attack me in my constituency office. A member of staff bought themselves a stab vest to come to my surgery.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de1c99415cb671ac127793035e087b5cb9972c02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de1c99415cb671ac127793035e087b5cb9972c02/0_0_1728_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dawn Butler in her days as a GMB organiser\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My parents taught me resilience\u2019 ... Butler in her days as a GMB organiser.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She had to close her constituency office because she could not guarantee her staff\u2019s safety. \u201cMy team had to wade through all this and basically grade [the messages], in terms of what Twitter might take down, or Facebook might take down, or the police might take seriously, or parliament might take seriously. And they were broken by all this. They\u2019re protecting me from the hate and I feel so guilty about it.\u201d</p> <p>We meet in her constituency, at the Arch, a deserted but intensely festive Indian restaurant in Wembley, where she is sitting in a cabana in the broadest sunshine, looking like a portrait of optimism. It is astonishing to hear, first-hand, about the racist abuse she has endured and to see the contrast between the grind of this nastiness and how undimmed she seems by it.</p> <p>She quickly and resolutely diverts from her own experience on to someone whom she thinks has it worse: Diane Abbott, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/05/diane-abbott-more-abused-than-any-other-mps-during-election\">the recipient of almost as much online abuse as all other female MPs combined</a>, according to research by Amnesty International in 2017. \u201cYou have people who\u2019ve made a career out of attacking Diane. What did she have to put up with when she entered parliament [in 1987]? What scars has she got, what did she have to do to keep the peace, how many times did she have to smile through it?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Whenever people of colour see a wrongful arrest or a killing, it brings back trauma</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are clear parallels in the way Abbott and Butler are treated, not just by political opponents and trolls on social media, but also by putatively respectable platforms. \u201cThey often try to dismiss what I\u2019m saying, then two or three weeks later everyone else is saying it and I\u2019m exonerated. A presenter said to me: did I read the government\u2019s report [on coronavirus], which was 50 pages. It was only 50 pages anyway because it had such a large font; if they\u2019d printed it at normal size, it would have been a pamphlet. And I was ridiculed for saying I hadn\u2019t. But I didn\u2019t need to read it \u2013 I\u2019d already read the science behind it. I\u2019m on the science and technology select committee.\u201d</p> <p>She says this portrayal \u2013 the idiot who is not on top of her brief \u2013 \u201cis a form of trolling. It\u2019s a trope. And it\u2019s racism. It\u2019s something that black women face all the time. We are simultaneously invisible and visible.\u201d This has persisted throughout her life in the public eye, even the most triumphant and historic moments of which have been marked by this kneejerk ridicule. When she stood up to speak on behalf of Brown\u2019s government, \u201cthe first black woman to stand at the dispatch box, the Tories tried to belittle me at that moment in history. I can\u2019t remember his name, but one took great delight in telling me that \u2018upskilling\u2019 was not in the English dictionary. He knew it was a momentous time, but they\u2019d all been instructed to put me down.\u201d</p> <p>But the person she remembers vividly from that day is Sadiq Khan, who was a transport minister at the time. \u201cHe ran from the other side of parliament to make sure he sat beside me. He was all out of breath. He said: \u2018I\u2019m not letting you do this by yourself.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"380e32cdb05dd11bc0d621a86ffc6925f3001b4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/380e32cdb05dd11bc0d621a86ffc6925f3001b4c/0_0_6285_4190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Butler (fourth left) on the March4Women in London in March 2018, alongside celebrities, activists and other politicians, including the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan (fifth left)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When I stood at the dispatch box, he ran from the other side of parliament to make sure he sat beside me\u2019 ...

The obvious assumption is that she made a strategic shift in her own politics to fit in with the new order, but the only sign of that in her voting record is that, early on, <a href=\"https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/11447/dawn_butler/brent_central/divisions?policy=975\">she voted consistently against an inquiry into the Iraq war</a>, which would have aligned her with the right of the party.</p> <p>She rejects that and gives a straightforward, personal reason for those votes: \u201cI never believed in holding an inquiry while we still had troops in Iraq. My brother was in the army and I spoke to him about it. If you held an inquiry while the troops were still out there doing their best to fight for the country, it would have been soul-destroying for them.\u201d</p> <p>Her analysis is that Labour moved rightwards after 2010: \u201cWhen I came back in 2015, I was a little bit surprised at the sorts of things that the Labour party was comfortable with, like the welfare reform bill [in which Harriet Harman, as interim leader, instructed MPs not to vote against Conservative cuts]. I didn\u2019t understand what had happened in my time away; I was only gone for five years. That\u2019s when I knew that Jeremy Corbyn was going to do well, because he knew who he was and what our values were as a party.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bab9f42d76a9f8829e9eb5d8ea76c79982b3379\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bab9f42d76a9f8829e9eb5d8ea76c79982b3379/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dawn Butler on Labour\u2019s front bench in October 2018 with Jeremy Corbyn, then the leader of the party, and Kate Osamor, then the shadow secretary for international development\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I knew that I had skills to contribute\u2019 ... on Labour\u2019s front bench in October 2018 with Jeremy Corbyn, then the leader of the party, and Kate Osamor, then the shadow secretary for international development.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Corbyn did not woo her into the shadow cabinet \u2013 she had to break down his door. \u201cHe had a lot of inexperienced people around him and that wasn\u2019t helping us. I knew that I could help him at PMQs; I knew that I had skills to contribute.\u201d Butler\u2019s critique of Corbyn\u2019s time is deeply felt, but quite careful. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/19/labour-party-financial-peril-keir-starmer-members-leaked-report\">The Labour leaked report</a> [into the party\u2019s handling of antisemitism, which described a closed inner circle around the leader, outside of which was a party so riven that staffers were actively hoping for electoral defeat] cut very deep. I was very bruised by that. The lesson is: you need people around you when you\u2019re in power who will question what you\u2019re doing, because you\u2019ll make better decisions.\u201d</p> <p>I ask, of course, whether she is glad of Keir Starmer\u2019s victory. \u201cI would have been glad whoever won.\u201d She dissolves into laughter and immediately concedes: \u201cThat\u2019s really a cop-out. Am I glad? Do you know what I think? I think the Labour party\u2019s leadership election system needs to change. I don\u2019t think you should be having an internal election that means you have to spend a lot of money.\u201d</p> <p>She then rattles off how much everything costs \u2013 \u00a35,000 to get access to the membership lists, \u00a313,000 to pay for the system to contact members by text, half a million for a mailout. \u201cI thought working 24 hours a day would be enough to win. But, actually, I needed money to access some of the systems that were needed. And I had 30 grand. Before the phone calls and mailouts started, I was in second place.\u201d In the event, Butler came last, on 11%.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The government is using the virus as a smokescreen for what\u2019s going to happen post-transition</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another interpretation is that her campaign did not get across who she is. She often used to come across as dry and cautious, with more than a trace of the disciplined minister of government, serious and liable to equivocate. That Butler has vanished: no longer bound by the responsibilities of the frontbench, she relishes the freedom to choose her own causes: \u201cThere are things that I need to speak out on that may make Keir feel uncomfortable.\u201d She also seems to have liberated her personality: funny, zealous, mischievous, pioneering.</p> <p>Her chosen causes are varied: she has a fairly geeky, careful eye on government procurement, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/25/the-uk-app-failure-sums-up-our-fatally-flawed-coronavirus-response\">the contact-tracing app</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/09/government-cancels-brexit-ferry-contract-with-no-ship-firm\">Chris Grayling\u2019s shipping contract with a company that had no ships</a>. She is viscerally worried about a bad or no-deal Brexit and what it will do to her constituents. \u201cI think a lot of what this government is doing is that they\u2019re using it [the virus] as a smokescreen for what\u2019s going to happen post-transition. And we really have to work hard at informing the public as to what\u2019s actually going on.\u201d</p> <p>And the Black Lives Matter movement \u2013 \u201cIt is a movement, not a moment,\u201d she says, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/06/keir-starmer-to-sign-up-for-unconscious-bias-training-amid-criticism\">referring to Starmer calling it the latter</a>, for which he later apologised \u2013 \u201chas got me thinking about all kinds of things. Whenever, in general, African-Caribbean people, people of colour, see an injustice taking place, a wrongful arrest or a killing, it brings back trauma, it makes you think of the stuff you\u2019ve been through, or your family has been through. My parents taught me resilience, but it was their resilience. My brothers taught me resistance, how to survive.

There are people who are understanding that they have privilege whether they\u2019ve asked for it or not.\u201d</p> <p>It is the fight of a generation, she says, but the vastness of it does not put her off identifying the practical solutions she wants now: the resignation of the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, for one. \u201cI work with the police and they want the racist police officers out of the force the same way I do. But if you\u2019ve got the head of the force refusing to acknowledge anything\u2019s wrong, that\u2019s never going to happen. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/19/met-police-disproportionately-white-for-another-100-years\">She doesn\u2019t accept the terminology \u2018institutional racism\u2019</a>.

The fact is, where a police officer can stop a person of colour driving a car, saying: \u2018We smelled drugs coming from your car; that\u2019s why we stopped you,\u2019 and then, when they search the car, there are no drugs, you have to ask yourself: what were they smelling?\u201d</p> <p>Butler is adamant that she wants a life after Westminster \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t want to be wheeled out\u201d \u2013 but she has unfinished business: \u201cthe eradication of racism. We live in a topsy-turvy world where it\u2019s a sin to call someone racist, but not a sin to be racist.\u201d Plus, \u201cI made a commitment to myself, when I was elected to parliament, that I would ensure there would be other African-Caribbean women coming behind me. There\u2019s no point in being the only one. It\u2019s too much of a burden for one person to carry and we won\u2019t see change.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>When I first noticed that there were non-black faces in the myriad protests demanding justice for the police murder of George Floyd across the world over the last few days, I thought: it\u2019s nice to see that oppressed black people aren\u2019t the only ones speaking out about the oppression of black people. Because generally that\u2019s been the case. But that feeling of relief dissolved after big organizations such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1266852547890839552\">the NFL</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheCW/status/1267230279078461443/photo/1\">The CW</a>, as well as stars like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeaMichele/status/1266460976116719616\">Lea Michele</a>, jumped on that bandwagon to align themselves with the fight for black humanity. Because these are some of the same platforms that have silenced us.</p> <p>I get it; a major impetus for the protests is the lack of accountability \u2013 for the careless condemnation of black life, the quelling of black voices and the utter disregard for our image. Of course, you want to <em>look</em> like the white organization or public figure that is on the right side of history, appealing to the oppressed who are in part frustrated that a country they helped build has once again abandoned them. And truthfully, black people need the support of non-black people to clench justice in a broken nation still run and dictated by white oppressors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/03/blackout-tuesday-george-floyd-social-media\">As responses to George Floyd's death go, #BlackOutTuesday was embarrassing | Fatima Bhutto</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For one split moment in time, it seemed like some of these influential white entities had finally gotten the point after years of directing their attention toward the absence of accountability, which extends far beyond the court system to the big and small screens as well as our football stadiums. But because we are living in a time when black people are so fed up that they are risking their lives marching in crowds during a pandemic to demand responsibility for white supremacy, pithy statements are no longer adequate declarations of alliance.</p> <p>Not when those very institutions like the NFL discarded Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during the national anthem to contest police brutality and racial inequality. Not when The CW, despite its black-led series like Black Lightning<em> </em>and All American, can\u2019t be bothered to <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/p/vanessa-morgan-calls-out-riverdale-for-sidelining-black-characters-22952139\">portray black characters</a> on its other show, Riverdale, as multidimensional humans and not just barely visible sidekicks to white characters. Not when Michele reportedly made a black former cast mate\u2019s first television gig \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sammie_Ware/status/1267632171570745345\">a living hell</a>\u201d.

Black people are long past the point of niceties and respectable dialogue that dances around the issues without solving anything at all. There needs to be indisputable action. Hence the question of accountability, or rather the lack thereof, which brought us to this current juncture. In order to gain alliance and make real change, you have to first acknowledge your own actions as wrongdoings.</p> <p>You have to understand the fight you\u2019re allegedly signing up for \u2013 the fight for criminal justice, the fight for black characters to receive the same level of amplification as their white counterparts, the fight to protest against rampant inequality without fear of repercussions or loss of life. You also have to understand your complicity, which includes remaining silent in the face of injustice. Because that only underscores how you willfully and remorselessly benefit from your own privilege.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In order to gain alliance and make real change, you have to first acknowledge your own actions as wrongdoings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s going to take more than just a handsome donation to the NAACP or an empty vow to hire more black storytellers behind the scenes without actually doing so or an equally hollow apology castigating your own actions without a full understanding of why. It needs to be a complete overhaul of your way of thinking and doing today and every other day that follows. One of the most urgent things that these daily protests have made crystal clear is that what was once passable can no longer be tolerated. Accountability is not merely a suggestion but a mandate that has similarly merciless impact if not adhered.</p> <p>That means you will continue to be publicly called out about any false commitments to do better. Apathy toward any lingering black supporters, one of the largest consumer groups on the planet, may result in depleted ratings or ticket sales. Voting in favor of white supremacy and against the lives of black people you swiftly hailed during this one moment in time will surely be met with more sleepless nights of protest in the street.</p> <p>Black people simply have no time to hold your hand or explain how you have wronged us and should no longer be expected to do so. Racism is something we live with every single day of our lives. You\u2019re either in this fight with us every day, or you\u2019re not. If it is the latter, consider these protests your official notice.</p> <p>There is no going back to the way things were handled.

It's defunding. Here's why  | Alex S Vitale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is no shortage of examples of police using excessive force against protesters. In <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/5/31/21275994/police-violence-peaceful-protesters-images\">New York</a>, officers who had intentionally covered their badge numbers \u201cpulled down the mask of a peaceful protester, who had his hands up, and pepper-sprayed him in the face\u201d. In Salt Lake City, an older man with a cane was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/1266908354821206016\">shoved to the ground</a>. In Austin, police shot a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayjanner/status/1267111893753307137\">pregnant woman</a> in the stomach with a \u201cnon-lethal\u201d round. There were <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drivenbyboredom/status/1267263490009546753\">scenes</a> reminiscent of the infamously brutal suppression of demonstrators at the 1968 Chicago Democratic convention. As Reason<em> </em><a href=\"https://reason.com/2020/05/31/d-c-cops-kept-herding-protesters-into-harms-way/\">concluded</a>, officers around the country acted with \u201ctotal disregard for protesters\u2019 safety or rights\u201d.</p> <p>There was no real need for those New York officers to disguise their badge numbers. After all, even when police officers\u2019 names are fully known, there is rarely any accountability. The whole reason protesters are angry is that it seems American cops can get away with almost anything. In 2016, an Arizona police officer <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/09/us/police-shooting-video-arizona.html\">executed a man</a> who was pleading for his life. It was on video. The officer was <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/daniel-shaver-shooting-ex-arizona-police-officer-not-guilty-murder-n827641\">acquitted</a>. This was not an exceptional case; it <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/police-officers-convicted-fatal-shootings-are-exception-not-rule-n982741\">happens over and over</a>. If outright murder goes unpunished, no officer need every worry about getting in trouble for blinding and maiming a few protesters.&nbsp;</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s the protesters who are called violent, even when the overwhelming majority do nothing but march and chant \u2013&nbsp;though they <em>do </em>refuse to back down, and challenging authority can be a capital crime in a police state. There have certainly been plenty of instances of vandalism and theft accompanying demonstrations, but it\u2019s important to make a clear distinction between acts of property destruction and actual violence. Setting a police car on fire is very costly to taxpayers, but harm to human bodies should be far more disturbing.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Setting a police car on fire is very costly to taxpayers, but harm to human bodies should be far more disturbing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>American police have been brutal for a long time, and both Democratic and Republican presidents have failed to successfully reform them. Barack Obama\u2019s justice department was admirable for <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-baltimore-chicago-police-2016-story.html\">at least investigating</a> a number of egregiously out-of-control departments, though <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/08/wait-do-people-actually-know-just-how-evil-this-man-is/\">outright criminals like Joe Arpaio</a> managed to remain in power throughout Obama\u2019s term. Donald Trump made it clear from the outset that if it was up to him, police could brutalize people with total impunity \u2013&nbsp;he even explicitly encouraged cops to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/28/16059536/trump-cops-speech-gang-violence-long-island\">rough people up during arrests</a>. <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/05/trumps-george-floyd-obama-protest-police-violence-kneeling.html\">According to</a> the Trump-supporting head of the Minneapolis police union, the president has reversed Obama\u2019s policies by \u201cletting the cops do their job, put the handcuffs on the criminals instead of us\u201d. But when cops kill, as in the case of George Floyd, they need to be the ones with the handcuffs on. Otherwise they have a license to freely murder citizens.&nbsp;</p> <p>There have been commendable exceptions to the pattern of police misconduct. In Michigan, a local sheriff <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/31/us/flint-michigan-protest-police-trnd/index.html\">marched with protesters</a> and in New York, several officers shocked protesters by <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/31/us/nypd-officers-kneel-with-protesters-trnd/index.html\">joining them in taking a knee</a>. But it seems to be that there are just a few \u201cgood apples\u201d in a generally rotten bunch. The frequency of aggressive, militarized responses to civil demonstrations suggests there is something very deeply wrong with police culture and with policing as an institution.</p> <p>At the very least, we need to seriously demilitarize the police, so that they do not appear to be an occupying army, <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2017/10/21/when-local-cops-drive-tanks-the-deadly-consequences-of-militarizing-mayberry/\">complete with tanks</a>. But there are serious criminal punishment scholars <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/10/15/alex-vitale-interview-the-end-of-policing/\">who have suggested</a> we need to talk about \u201cending the police\u201d altogether. By this, they do not mean allowing anyone to victimize anyone else without fear of consequences, or ceasing to protect the population from threats. Rather, they mean totally rethinking how laws are enforced and how social problems are addressed. Having a militarized force respond to situations that require social workers trained to deal with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Charles_Kinsey\">mental health issues</a> has often made things <a href=\"https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/family-of-man-killed-by-cpd-says-he-was-mentally-ill-should-not-have-been-shot\">tragically worse rather than better</a>. Frankly, fire departments seem like they would do a much better job addressing many of the situations that police are now dispatched to deal with. Firefighters actually protect and serve, while police too often act like squads of armed thugs rather than compassionate and helpful community servants.&nbsp;</p> <p>In theory, the police are supposed to protect the community. When they are whacking the community with sticks, and firing teargas into it, they are more like an armed gang than keepers of the peace. When police show no interest in obeying the constitution or treating protesters with dignity and care, then they should cease to command respect. A police force that runs amok does not deserve to be called \u201claw enforcement\u201d. They are rioters, plain and simple.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Nathan Robinson is a Guardian US columnist and the editor of Current Affairs</p></li> </ul>"

Using a tactic that has become common in recent protests, a group of about 30 protesters showed up to Lacey\u2019s Granada Hills home in the early morning. They brought chairs with them saying they were going to hold the community meeting that they had been promised. There were no threats of violence from the demonstrators.</p> \n<p>Abdullah said it seemed the charges were meant to \u201cplacate the community\u201d, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s trying to give us the illusion that there is justice.\u201d</p> \n<p>She also said it had taken time for her to process what happened, though she has continued to be a vocal presence at the demonstrations against police violence in recent months. The incident affected her whole family, she said, noting that her children had to leave their classrooms when it happened: \u201cIt\u2019s not only weighed on me.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hours after the original incident, Jackie Lacey offered a tearful apology to reporters, saying she and her husband were frightened.</p> \n<p>The DA\u2019s office declined to comment on Tuesday and Lacey\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to an inquiry. Lacey is facing a tough re-election fight in November and has long faced criticism for her handling of killings by police, her aggressive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/18/los-angeles-death-penalty-sentences-jackie-lacey\">pursuit of the death penalty</a> and other <a href=\"https://theappeal.org/how-district-attorney-jackie-lacey-failed-los-angeles/\">tough-on-crime strategies</a>.</p>"

When actor John Boyega, from Star Wars and Attack the Block, addressed protesters at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/thousands-gather-in-london-for-george-floyd-protest\">Black Lives Matter rally in London\u2019s Hyde Park</a>, he said: \u201cI\u2019m speaking to you from my heart. Look, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to have a career after this, but fuck that.\u201d Social media exploded with knowing jeers and giggling gotchas about how, actually, Boyega <em>had</em> to protest, or else his career would suffer! People on Twitter who had shown no very obvious knowledge of or interest in the issue of civil rights or Hollywood politics before this, were suddenly intoxicated by their delicious paradox, and made Boyega\u2019s comments the pretext of once again righteously smashing the 5G mast of liberal power.</p> \n<p>I don\u2019t think Boyega\u2019s comments will have any effect on his career, either good or bad. The career of this excellent actor was in great shape before this and it will continue to be in great shape. But vehement protests of this high-profile kind are not quite as commonplace as you might assume. Although protests about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> have been replicated in cities around the world, there is no evidence of compulsory virtue-signalling from actors. In the US, there have been protests from Jamie Foxx and Michael B Jordan and many others, but it\u2019s naive to imagine agents in LA calling their clients and ordering them to join in. For every celebrity or public figure who speaks out, many more keep their heads down.</p> \n<p>John Boyega\u2019s words strike me as a gallant, passionate, heartfelt gesture of solidarity \u2013 which will have real&nbsp;impact. As a black British actor who has been given a platform by Hollywood, and who has spoken himself about his own sense of kinship between black British and African American communities, Boyega has used his public profile as a force for idealism and consciousness-raising. (Which the world of mainstream-punditry once praised when Princess Diana did it for landmine-clearance and Aids patients.) One note of support has come from the Star Wars brand itself: his decision to speak out sealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/04/john-boyega-anti-racism-speech-wins-praise-star-wars-costars-black-lives-matter\">its corporate decision to associate itself</a> with the protest.</p> \n<p>His dramatic speech is part of a vigorous and distinguished tradition: Harry Belafonte performed at a benefit for Martin Luther King in 1966, and at many other occasions and civil rights demonstrations, and the white British singer Petula Clark infuriated racists by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/02/how-petula-clark-and-harry-belafonte-fought-racism-arm-in-arm\">appearing on the same stage as him</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f76c136a38e69a306e4435efeff3889c57bc4d04\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f76c136a38e69a306e4435efeff3889c57bc4d04/0_362_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harry Belafonte and Petula Clark in 1968.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry Belafonte and Petula Clark in 1968.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Vietnam galvanised Hollywood protesters including Jane Fonda, John Lennon and Yoko Ono. In recent years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/02/george-clooney-racism-americas-pandemic-george-floyd-killing-minneapolis\">George Clooney</a> and his father, journalist Nick Clooney, were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/16/george-clooney-arrested-sudanese-embassy\">arrested in 2012 outside the Sudanese embassy</a> in protest at the lack of humanitarian aid and the killing of Sudanese civilians. Danny Glover was arrested in 2010 outside a food service corporation in Maryland as part of a solidarity protest in support of the labour union there. There are many such events, and Sean Penn, Susan Sarandon and Martin Sheen have become protest veterans. Of course, these events have become understood as a species of media event: the&nbsp;<em>bien-pensant&nbsp;</em>star marches with a placard \u2013 many are irritated by what they see as an affectation; some more notice only the star\u2019s appearance and do not remember what the cause was, but some will, like iron filings sticking to a magnet that\u2019s been shaken.</p> \n<p>It brings us back to John Boyega. His Hyde Park speech is a teachable moment in the history of race, racism and celebrity. It has become a truism to note how Hollywood now gives black British actors who can do American accents real career chances that might well not be available back in Blighty. Perhaps in the UK they would be stuck playing minor roles or bad guys or hopeless social-realist cases; in Hollywood they can get to be heroes, who take on the Evil Empire. That may well resonate with black British audiences and black Britons who wonder why the history of empire does not have the urgency of Tudors and Nazis in British schools or historical TV programmes, and they are impatient with people in this country who behave as if racism in Britain is a minor bad-apple affair compared to that in America. John Boyega has spoken out on racial injustice in his own person on his own terms and challenged all of this.</p>"

Last week the International Crisis Group, usually preoccupied by global hotspots, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/george-floyd-killing-black-community-injustice-analysis\">warned that racial division</a> risks further \u201cdivision and instability\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking from Zimbabwe, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BitiTendai?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Tendai Biti,</a> a human rights lawyer, said he has a 13-year-old son growing up in Maryland. \u201cI\u2019m thinking whether I made the right decision to allow him to go to school in the United States of America because he\u2019s black and it\u2019s obvious there are huge structural issues around race, around inequality, around exclusion which America must deal with,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfa9df5ea56d48e54a541c190e3ce73ce79224cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfa9df5ea56d48e54a541c190e3ce73ce79224cf/0_107_5765_3461/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Colorado.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Colorado.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBut what\u2019s also shocking is the disproportionate response of the state, if you like, the Africanisation of American politics, the language of exclusion and the language of hate and, of course, what we\u2019ve seen, the exuberant and excessive force used by the authorities.\u201d</p> <p>Biti, a former political prisoner who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/06/zimbabwe-tendai-biti-assassination-fears\">served as finance minister</a> in a power-sharing agreement with the then president, Robert Mugabe, added: \u201cFor us, who have been fighting autocracies and dictatorship on the African continent, the events in America are giving licence and legitimacy to the authoritarianism and dictatorship and violence that we have seen as democrats for decades.</p> <p>\u201cEvery little tinpot on the African continent is smiling and is studying America\u2019s new copybook plucked from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, from Zimbabwe, from the Central African Republic, from Djibouti.\u201d</p> <p>The implications for journalists in Africa and elsewhere are profound, Biti added. \u201cWhenever truth becomes a casualty then journalists will suffer. They are mediums of communication, whether it\u2019s newspapers, whether it\u2019s websites, whether it\u2019s social media. In Africa, once, the medium of communication becomes a target, then the messengers become targets and you\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d</p> <p>Far from toning down his rhetoric, Trump has continued his assault in remarks and tweets. At the end of May <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1267132763116838913?s=20\">he wrote</a>, \u201cThe Lamestream Media is doing everything within their power to foment hatred and anarchy,\u201d and called journalists \u201ctruly bad people with a sick agenda\u201d. He has not offered any hint that he accepts responsibility for helping create a hostile environment.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/experts/william-a-galston/\">Bill Galston,</a> a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, said: \u201cI do a lot of reading every day about how the rest of the world is reacting to this and, as an American, it makes me really want to cry. We are the object of scorn from our enemies and pity from our friends. We\u2019ve come to this? At least your country [the UK] has had some decades to get accustomed to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-george-floyd-america-social-collapse-b566ae78-907c-41b7-992d-be5e33521fb2.html\">the idea of national decline</a>. We\u2019re new to it.\u201d</p>"

Since her son Amadou Diallo\u2019s death in a hail of 41 bullets from police in 1999, Kadiatou Diallo has watched black mothers grieve. So has Valerie Bell, since police shot her son Sean Bell 50 times hours before his wedding in 2006. As has Constance Malcolm, after police followed her 17-year-old son, Ramarley Graham, into his home in 2012, shooting him in front of his six-year-old brother after alleging they saw a gun on the unarmed teen.</p> <p>The four women spoke to a reporter ahead of a march in New York last week, organized by the families who have lost loved ones to police killings, as part of the ongoing protest movement triggered by Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no change,\u201d Diallo said.

All three mothers still hesitate to proclaim a changed nation as the country is gripped by weeks of protests. It\u2019s too soon, they say.&nbsp;</p> <p>All of the women agree that their call for changes to police protocols is one they have demanded for years. What\u2019s different this time, Malcolm says, is a generation hungry for change.</p> <p>\u201cWe have young people that want change. And they\u2019re on the frontline [and] they\u2019re willing to, basically, to me \u2026 they were willing to die, because if you see them up in these cops\u2019 faces, they have guns. And we know what they do when they have guns,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time that we\u2019ve been struggling as a people,\u201d Bell agreed.</p> <p>As a group, these women have called for a <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/gwenn-carr-constance-malcolm-cuomo-unkept-promise-article-1.2283047\">special prosecutor </a>to investigate all officer-involved deaths since 2015, the repeal of a <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-pol-50a-police-discipline-diallo-bell-garner-carr-20181223-story.html\">New York state law</a> protecting police from the release of their disciplinary records, and defunding the police.</p> <p>\u201cOur surviving children and grandchildren deserve to have a better future,\u201d said Diallo. \u201cThe only change I noticed,\u201d she added a little later, \u201cis the camera. The videos, that is educating people, showing them the truth.\u201d</p> <p>The video documenting Floyd\u2019s death has now been watched millions of times around the world, renewing calls for change, spurring protests and calls for changes to police departments nationally.&nbsp;Millions saw Garner\u2019s death, too, along with his final words: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p> <p>The officer involved in Garner\u2019s death was not indicted by a Staten Island grand jury. He was fired five years later.</p> <p>But this week, New York state legislators passed a law criminalizing the chokehold. State senator Diane Sabino <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.silive.com/news/2020/06/lawmakers-pass-bill-named-for-eric-garner-that-makes-police-chokehold-a-felony.html%3foutputType=amp\">credited</a> Garner\u2019s mother for this change.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our strength is to really push forward the change we need, because we\u2019re not going to give up</p> <footer> <cite>Kadiatou Diallo</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/defund-the-police-us-george-floyd-budgets\">movement to defund the police</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/george-floyd-protests-enter-third-week\">nationwide</a> might have gained traction in recent days, but it is something most of the women have called for well before the conversation seeped into American homes. Bell spent the previous weekend calling her local officials well into midnight along with Malcolm.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cYou have to keep on, and so many of them are out there who have it in their mind that they want to make the change, but they\u2019re afraid to make that change,\u201d Bell said. Some police forces have addressed those calls, taking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/09/new-york-police-budget-cut\">moderate steps</a> to reform policies.</p> <p>The four women are a tight-knit group.</p> <p>We are a team, Diallo said. One that won\u2019t stop.</p> <p>\u201cWhen George Floyd called his mama, all of the mothers were summoned to push forward and make things happen. Our strength, our strength is to really push forward the change we need because we\u2019re not going to give up.

It was a notable shift from the weekend prior, when police beat back demonstrators with force, using teargas and pepper spray to suppress the unrest.</p> \n<p>Mourners paid their respects to Floyd in North Carolina, his birthplace.

In France, hundreds of Parisians gathered in defiance of a ban on large protests.</p> \n<p>The week had seen incremental victories in the Floyd case, with charges announced against three former police officers who were present at his death, while charges against the officer who knelt on his neck were elevated to second-degree murder. In Minneapolis, marchers were joined by the US congresswoman Ilhan Omar. \u201cThe Minneapolis police department is rotten to the root,\u201d she told the crowd, \u201cand so when we dismantle it, we get rid of that cancer and we allow for something beautiful to rise.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Jessica Glenza and agencies contributed reporting</em></p>"

     "body": "<p>Black lives matter. Those three words \u2013 a statement distilled to its purest form \u2013 are the best explanation I can give as to why I will take a knee when rugby restarts on Friday night. I am totally aware that the statement has been politicised and I strongly disagree with some of the things the organisation stands for, but there is one reason why pretty much every household has developed a greater understanding and awareness of anti-racism recently: the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> <p>I also want to clear something up when it comes to taking a knee. There is the obvious association with the political organisation \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/12/premiership-rugby-union-will-restart-with-three-teams-taking-a-knee\">which has seen some Premiership players reluctant to do it this weekend</a> \u2013 and there is the fact that it was popularised by Colin Kaepernick, who has become such a global figure. But as I understand it, the origin of taking a knee was when Martin Luther King did so in 1965 during the civil rights movement. He did so as a peaceful protest and as a moment to say a prayer. I want to acknowledge and honour people like that who have done so much for people like me.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/12/premiership-rugby-union-restart-club-by-club-guide-comings-and-goings-2019-20\">Premiership restart: club-by-club guide to rugby union's return | Michael Aylwin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I also want to point out that I don\u2019t expect everyone to know that, because racism is not relatable to a lot of people. That is the fundamental point here \u2013 we are trying to make it relatable, to increase awareness and understanding. That\u2019s why I will take a knee, not for any other reason, and that\u2019s why I stand by Black Lives Matter because when you take it in its purest form, the origins of it are what I believe in. Nothing else. After all that\u2019s what the original meaning was before it was hijacked.</p> <p>My view is pretty clear, but at the same time I can\u2019t think of anything more counterintuitive than coercing rugby players to take a knee before their matches if they are not happy doing so. The people who are speaking up are from a community, or several communities, who felt marginalised. We can\u2019t then go and marginalise people for not taking a knee under the banner of anti-racism. It would be ridiculous.</p> <p>And it\u2019s not for me to make a judgment on people. We live in a democracy and people must use that liberty and that freedom. The one thing that is really required is a level of respect. If we respect and understand that people are different, all different shapes, sizes, backgrounds \u2013 you are inevitably going to get people who think differently. We have to respect all viewpoints, so long as it\u2019s not inciting hate or discriminatory in any way.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We need to stop having a debate about whether there is a problem or not \u2013 because speak to any black player and they will tell you there is</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m trying to create awareness and understanding but me talking about racism doesn\u2019t solve racism. I\u2019m trying to start a conversation in the hope it leads to action. I was having these conversations 10 weeks ago, trying to be proactive, and perhaps rugby has been a little bit slow to acknowledge the significance of it. Perhaps the fact that we are restarting as one of the last sports doesn\u2019t help, but I felt it was important that we have our \u201cday one\u201d before getting on with the season.</p> <p>This weekend has to be day one of rugby\u2019s fight against racism. Premiership Rugby is a very different type of organisation to the Premier League but right throughout this process rugby has been casting its eye and taking the lead from football. Well, look at football\u2019s long-standing anti-racism campaign. Rugby didn\u2019t have one until this week with Rugby Against Racism but it has been professional for 25 years. Don\u2019t tell me that there has not been any racial problems in that time, don\u2019t tell me there has not been injustice \u2013 this goes way back even before the professional era.</p> <p>There are some uncomfortable truths about our game but it\u2019s hard to progress until people recognise there is a problem. Until you do that you can\u2019t fix it. We need to stop having a debate about whether there is a problem or not \u2013 because speak to any black player and they will tell you there is. Anything beyond that is wilful ignorance and we have to be comfortable accepting that and then we can work towards dealing with it.</p> <p>I have been heavily involved as part of the working group, along with the former sevens international James Bailey and player representatives from each of the clubs. A consistent theme over the past few months has been a tendency for the public debate to revolve around what I would call the symptoms when we should be talking about the illness.</p> <p>Take Covid as an example, two main symptoms are a high temperature and a persistent cough. If I went to the chemist and got some medicine it might help but it\u2019s ignoring the illness. You have to address the illness. Swing Low, Sweet Chariot is a symptom \u2013 I don\u2019t really care about that, I\u2019m not bothered \u2013 can we now talk about the illness, about racism?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.<br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>For me it\u2019s not just about this weekend, it\u2019s about what we do next week and the week after to try and bring about change. It\u2019s what you do consistently. This isn\u2019t just about a moment in time, it\u2019s about our game being better and actively doing the things that it says it wants to do. It says it welcomes everyone \u2013 it may welcome everyone but it has not always made everyone feel comfortable.</p> <p>I love rugby, but I\u2019m really passionate about this because I think it could be better. I\u2019ve had my challenges in rugby \u2013 there is not a single player who hasn\u2019t \u2013 but some that I have faced I shouldn\u2019t have had to. It\u2019s about trying to combat that. I was talking to a referee about it recently. Teams will prepare for when they go down to 14 men \u2013 not because they want to or expect to but if you don\u2019t think about these things you\u2019ll never know how to properly deal with them. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do with anti-racism.</p>"

They voted Tory as far as I\u2019m concerned\u201d \u2013 with the comment \u201cMaxine Peake is an absolute diamond\u201d. Starmer said he felt compelled to sack her because \u201cI do not consider sharing that article furthered the course of rebuilding trust with the Jewish community\u201d.</p> <p>The Independent originally contextualised Peake\u2019s comments with a denial from an Israeli police spokesperson that they would recommend kneeling on a suspect\u2019s neck, before referencing a <a href=\"https://www.amnestyusa.org/with-whom-are-many-u-s-police-departments-training-with-a-chronic-human-rights-violator-israel/\">2016 blog post by Amnesty International USA</a> on how US police forces are regularly trained by Israeli officials.</p> <p>Several hours later the interview was updated to include a stronger denial from an Israeli police spokesperson insisting \u201cthere is no tactic or protocol that calls to put pressure on the neck or airway\u201d. An editor\u2019s note was also attached, distancing the Independent from Peake\u2019s claim: \u201cThis article has been amended to further clarify that the allegation that US police were taught tactics of \u2018neck kneeling\u2019 by Israeli secret services is unfounded.\u201d</p> <p>The connections between US police forces and the training offered by the Israeli state has come under increased media attention in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis. This has generated viral posts and media coverage that has sometimes extrapolated from known facts to make broader unsourced claims. </p> <p>There is no doubt that there are many programmes involving Israeli officials offering training to US police forces. Some programmes are conducted on US soil in conjunction with the Israeli embassy, <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2012/06/25/minn-police-learn-from-israeli-counter-terrorism-conference\">such as a 2012 event</a> where 100 officers from Minnetonka \u2013 a city 8 miles from Minneapolis, where Floyd was killed \u2013 were trained on how to combat terrorists. Other programmes, often organised by pro-Israel organisations based in the US, involved flying small groups of officers to Israel for training programmes. Such police exchanges are not uncommon.</p> <p>This recent interest has led to coverage in sites <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-us-police-training-end-knee-neck-protests\">such as Middle East Eye</a> focusing on which US forces have been involved in these exchange programmes, though most have not drawn any link between the Israeli training and the tactic used to kill Floyd.</p>"

Or maybe \u2013 having risked her own health to work in the emergency room through the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 she\u2019d be handing out protective masks. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so grateful to everybody,\u201d said Tamika Palmer, Taylor\u2019s mother, as she gave brief remarks at a gathering that was half celebration of life, half protest.</p> <p>\u201cY\u2019all don\u2019t understand. It started off lonely, but it\u2019s so amazing to see so many people standing up for her, just saying her name. And trust: if it was anybody else, Breonna would be out here doing the same thing. And that\u2019s what I want people to understand about her.\u201d</p> <p>It has been nearly three months since&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Taylor was killed in her home</a>. Plainclothes cops had been serving a no-knock search warrant in a narcotics investigation when they burst through her door in the first hour of 13 March while Taylor was sleeping. Her boyfriend Kenneth Walker, a licensed gun owner, grabbed his gun and fired off a shot, thinking they were witnessing a home invasion. He hit an officer in the leg.</p> <p>Police fired back more than 20 times, killing Taylor and sending bullets flying into a neighboring apartment. No drugs were found.</p> <p>Yet after her killing, Louisville metro police department described her as a suspect. Her boyfriend was charged with attempted murder of a police officer, and a police union called him an \u201cattempted cop killer\u201d. The cops involved in the incident were not wearing body cameras.</p> <p>Charges against Walker have since been dropped, but the officers still have their freedom and their jobs, driving anger in Louisville. That anger has been compounded by the death of McAtee, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/david-mcatee-louisville-protests-family\">who was shot and killed at his barbecue stand</a> far from the center of protests early Monday morning as LMPD officers and national guard troops tried to clear a crowd violating curfew.</p> <p>Police say McAtee fired a shot, prompting them to open fire. In violation of policy, officers involved were either not wearing body cameras or did not activate them. The killings \u2013 combined with nationwide rage over Floyd\u2019s death and police brutality \u2013 have prompted widespread protests in Louisville over the past nine days.</p> <p>On a sweltering Friday afternoon in downtown Louisville, businesses were busy boarding up windows, but the mood at the park was calm, hopeful and welcoming. People signed a large banner wishing Taylor a happy birthday while others wrote birthday cards and letters to the city. A woman painted a portrait of Taylor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"199e994f20cc52608229d4e8e3363b39d0e37e8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/199e994f20cc52608229d4e8e3363b39d0e37e8a/0_173_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aleah Cohen and Destiny Hancock hold up signs across the street from Louisville\u2019s Metro Hall. \u2018We shouldn\u2019t be scared to leave our houses.

It\u2019s something that could literally happen to any of us, especially because she\u2019s at home, in her bedroom,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t be safe at home in bed asleep, where can you be safe?\u201d</p> <p>Cohen says she has experienced racism as a young black woman in Louisville. At an old job, her and a friend got called the N-word and she was accused of stealing. She says HR told her to suck it up.</p> <p>On the night Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016 she says a guy chased her around her neighborhood in a pickup truck.

I shouldn\u2019t be scared to drive around at night,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Hancock said the protest response to Taylor\u2019s death now goes much further than just getting justice for her.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s for Breonna to make it about more than Breonna,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about more than just Breonna \u2013 it\u2019s about change long-term.\u201d</p>"

Their short-term goal, they say, is to act as a physical presence of intimidation to deter protesters from becoming violent and destroying the state of Utah. Their long-term goal: to arm and prepare the state of Utah against underground movements they believe<strong> </strong>will incite civil war.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/27/trump-border-patrol-troops-portland-bortac\">'These are his people': inside the elite border patrol unit Trump sent to Portland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The group was conceived in reaction to a Black Lives Matter protest against police brutality organized by different groups in Provo, Utah, on 29 June. That day, a white protester pulled out a gun and shot another white man, who was not protesting but<strong> </strong>driving his vehicle into the protest route. Two shots were fired, and one hit the driver in the arm. Protesters claim the shooting was in self-defence because the driver was hitting marchers; the police found this claim to be unsubstantiated.</p> <p>When Casey Robertson, 47, watched a video of the incident, he felt outraged that this could happen in his \u201clittle town of Provo\u201d. He posted on his Facebook page and a local yard sale page that \u201cprotesters descended on downtown Provo and terrorized citizens and SHOTS WERE FIRED.\u201d He explained that Insurgence, one of the organizing group, was planning another protest for the next night and he rallied \u201cconcerned citizens\u201d to come together, armed and ready to do their part in protecting downtown businesses.</p> <p>This was a call to arms. Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm was born.</p> <p>\u201cI was like, \u2018We need to stand together as citizens and go down there and show these people that we\u2019re not going to allow violence, and that we are not going to allow these anarchist violent groups to tear down Provo,\u201d Robertson told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen without a fight.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm has since organized regular military-style trainings for its members. Robertson says he has been tipped off \u201cby secret sources within the government and law enforcement\u201d that underground organizations like antifa are being funded by Isis, and are using groups like BLM to wreak havoc in the community to destroy American cities and ideals. Even if none of these theories stand up to scrutiny, he is dead set on not letting it happen.</p> <p>Robertson was born and raised in Provo. His dad was a Provo police officer and his mother a police dispatcher. He has voted both sides of the political aisle \u2013 he voted for Clinton and Obama, although he now considers himself a conservative. To him, this is not about politics, but good and evil, and he is ready to die for this cause.</p> <p>\u201cMy biggest fear, probably, is my children being brought up and having to grow up in a country that has completely lost its freedom, and that is under attack, and that is turning into this cesspool of violence and chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cOur enemy is now within, and that\u2019s really scary to me.\u201d</p> <p>This already has a chilling effect on protests: organizers have begun cancelling protests out of fear of Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm coming and escalating the already heated emotions. So far, militia members remain unchallenged, using their second amendment rights to openly bear arms in public throughout the state.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018We are here to protect the community\u2019</strong></h2> <p>That same Black Lives Matter protest that inspired Robertson\u2019s fear was originally planned as a pro-police event in downtown Provo. John Sullivan, 26, the founder of Insurgence USA, a group for racial justice and police reform, organized a counter-protest alongside several other organizers. Protesters were to meet at the Provo police station at 6.30pm that night.</p> <p>Sullivan, one of the few black men organizing<strong> </strong>for racial justice in Utah, is not from Provo but Sandy, a suburb of Salt Lake City. Provo is a hyper-religious Latter-day Saint college town located 45 miles south of Salt Lake City. The city is <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/provocityutah\">made up</a> of about 110,000 people, 88% white, 16.6% Hispanic, and less than 1% black. Local quirks include a strong second amendment culture, strong self-reliant groups, end of world preppers, a booming music scene and a charming Center Street that has at least three ice cream parlors and only recently got its first coffee shop, as the predominant demography does not drink coffee for religious purposes.</p> <p>The Black Lives Matter protesters started to march. They yelled \u201cWhose streets? Our streets!\u201d at drivers and lingered in front of cars, some of which started plowing through the crowd, claiming protesters had surrounded them and would not let them leave. (Videos show this was not the case.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"123b7bd230b8d09be8f11083ebdbee0fb4c0859a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/123b7bd230b8d09be8f11083ebdbee0fb4c0859a/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Sullivan of Insurgence USA speaks to Black Lives Matter protesters and counter protest groups in Provo, Utah on Wednesday July 1st, 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Sullivan of Insurgence USA speaks to Black Lives Matter protesters and counter-protest groups.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Waggoner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brian DeLong, a philosophy student at Utah Valley University, was grabbing a coffee when he saw protesters pass by. He joined in the march. At the intersection of University Avenue and Center Street, he was hit by a silver Excursion going southbound and immediately heard two gunshots, one after the other. DeLong bounced off the car and realized about five other people had also been hit. The driver frantically drove off.</p> <p>Nine minutes later, an ambulance appeared on the scene. The police did not come, and only appeared in full riot gear at 9.40pm when protesters made it back to the front of the police station.</p> <p>Drivers driving into protesters resulting in people shooting guns is becoming more frequent. On July 25, an Austin motorist <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/us/austin-shooting-texas-protests.html\">drove into a crowd</a> and fatally shot a protester. On the same night, another driver drove into protesters in Aurora, Colorado \u2013 except it was a protester who took out his gun and ended up shooting two fellow protesters.</p> <p>After the Provo protest, a policeman told Josianne Petit, 34, a criminal defense paralegal and founder of Mama &amp; Papa Panthers, an organization dedicated to helping parents of all races in raising black children, that the police were inside watching the whole protest on Facebook Live. She said: \u201cI felt fundamentally betrayed. I had worked with Provo PD extensively prior to that protest and I thought I had a good working relationship with them, but to hear the complete disregard they had for the lives of protesters was alarming to me, but also devastating.\u201d</p> <p>Sullivan, the organizer, was not prepared for what transpired, nor did he know that anyone had a gun on his side of the protest. He created another Facebook event to hold a protest two days later in response.</p> <p>On that day, the two sides stood facing each other. The protesters carried posters; the Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm carried assault rifles. The protesters wore black; the paramilitia wore American flags. Both groups wore masks. On the west side, it was to protect themselves from the coronavirus. On the east side, masks were a protection from unwanted media attention.</p> <p>One young man carrying an assault rifle and two magazines of ammunition, with his face completely covered, pointed at the protesters and said: \u201cWhat they have done is straight out of the communist manifesto \u2026 they say that your political beliefs are now your identity and, if somebody\u2019s against your identity, they can justify whatever they do against you because they\u2019re now repressing you for not agreeing with you.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cNot everybody over there but the more extremists will agree with that. Black Lives Matter, as an organization, receives money from people who want to see violence happen.\u201d</p> <p>Another young man walked over and said: \u201cThey hate America. They say they want to change America, that\u2019s un-American.\u201d</p> <p>The BLM protesters were authorized to march in the street. Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm was permitted to march on the sidewalks, guarding the storefronts from the protesters. About 250 policemen were brought in, as well as at least four snipers who stood on the roof of the Nu Skin building, a ten-storey building next to the Mormon temple.</p> <p>One police officer from Springville, a town just south of Provo, said he trusted 99.9% of the men and women with the guns, and said: \u201cThose men and women would be the first people to take a bullet for any of the protesters there.\u201d</p> <p>At the end of the march, Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm members came to the megaphone and repeated the Springville police officer\u2019s line: \u201cWe are here to protect the community. We would be the first to take a bullet for each and every one of you.\u201d</p> <p>Josey Gardner, 25, a protester and EMT studying English at BYU, asked: \u201cWhose bullets are they protecting us from? They are the only ones with guns.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>A chilling effect on free speech</strong></h2> <p>Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm is now organized into a pseudo-militia under the guidance of ex-military and ex-law enforcement on their newly formed board of advisers. They want Utah to be fully prepared for the \u201ccivil war\u201d instigated by underground, militant forces.</p> <p>The group trains tirelessly. When on site, members are advised to move in groups of three and no less, because they have been told by informants on the inside that antifa attacks single out the strongest members in vulnerable situations. They have escape plans at every site, and promote a firm obedience to the local police, including when asked by them not to come to a protest.</p> <p>(Provo police chief Rich Ferguson made a statement that the Provo police have no relationship with the Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm, which Sergeant Nisha King, head of the Provo police department\u2019s public information team, verified. )</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"caf98f9b075982816c0418e88550e6565c09639a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caf98f9b075982816c0418e88550e6565c09639a/0_0_4431_2954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Opposing protest groups march on opposite sides of the street in Provo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Opposing protest groups march on opposite sides of the street in Provo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Waggoner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, militia members have now been to almost every protest<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasatch_Front\"> on the Wasatch Front</a>. They come to protests throughout the state with anywhere between 30 to 1,000 members in full uniform (sometimes homemade, sometimes military-grade), some in bulletproof vests, and openly carrying ARs. They silently stand in the background and observe, always on guard believing they may be called upon to act quickly if something goes wrong.</p> <p>A protest in Taylorsville was cancelled because too many protesters felt the risk was not worth being there. Robertson took this as a win.</p> <p>Jason Stevens, of Utah\u2019s American Civil Liberties Union, stressed the importance of the historical context in what happened in the civil rights movement of the 1960s when armed groups, militias, local chapters of the Ku Klux Klan, white citizens councils, organizations both official and unofficial took it upon themselves to defend what they saw as their rights and property with violent and systemic intimidation and threats to African Americans and others in those areas.</p> <p>\u201cI am not saying that is what is happening here. But with context, if you are a protester and you see groups like this showing up at your protest, that\u2019s got to be in the back of your mind, this history of intimidation and threats.\u201d</p> <p>Outside of Utah, these threats are present and real for protesters. In Omak, Washington, small civilian militias are forming to threaten protesters. In New Mexico, there is another civilian militia group that call themselves the New Mexico Civil Guard reacting to rioting and looting.</p> <p>In Portland, the threats to free speech and the right to protest are coming from the federal government, which has deployed unidentified agents to quell protests by forcibly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/24/trump-goon-squad-john-sandweg-homeland-security-ice\">grabbing protesters and taking them away in unidentified vehicles</a>.</p> <p>BLM-adjacent groups held a \u201cStop Kidnapping Protesters\u201d event in Salt Lake City on 22 July, in reference to what took place in Portland. Robertson and his team came in full garb and made a live video. Robertson said: \u201cThat\u2019s the name of the protest \u2013 \u2018Stop kidnapping protesters\u2019. My boy over here translated it as \u2018stop arresting criminals\u2019. The awesome thing is these people that are out creating chaos and committing crimes, they are being watched. Law enforcement finally started to go around and pick them up and arrest them. I am all for it.\u201d</p> <p>Additionally, lines between the second and first amendment are complicated, especially as open-carry laws in Utah make it legal for groups of heavily armed individuals to gather in places where the first amendment is being honored, such as protests.</p> <p>\u201cIf the right to bear arms is overriding the right to free speech, that may be cause for concern,\u201d said Dr RonNell Andersen Jones, a law professor at the University of Utah. \u201cOur constitutional doctrine hasn\u2019t yet had the chance to really tussle with the question of what the presence of guns does to a free speech event. Short of more overt threats of violence, we usually protect protesters with guns in the same ways we protect protesters without them. But if the express goal of the armed individuals is to intimidate people who might otherwise share their views, that\u2019s especially troubling.\u201d</p> <p>In response to Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm, Utah protesters are now arming themselves. John Sullivan of Insurgence USA held his first armed protest on 22 July at the Utah state capitol, carrying an AR-15 and a magazine of ammo. He is encouraging Insurgence USA protesters to purchase guns so they can protect themselves if there is violence.</p> <p>\u201cBasically, nobody in our group owns a gun except for me; nobody was planning on ever shooting anyone. So the fact that I bought a bulletproof vest and more magazines and our people are buying guns should say a lot. It shouldn\u2019t be that way.\u201d</p> <p>Petit, who also organizes alongside BLM and Insurgence USA, has recruited ex-military to train and arm her protesters, because she feels the threat is real as long as Utah Citizens\u2019 Alarm is showing up.</p> <p>\u201cThe only way forward is to make sure we are prepared, because at this point the options the only options available to us are when things go crazy we lie down and die, or we fight back.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not lying down for anybody.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>After the statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston was hauled to the ground last weekend, a series of black Bristolians clambered on his empty plinth and spoke from the heart about racism and the struggle for equality in the city and beyond.</p> <p>\u201cThis city needs to change,\u201d declared Bristol rapper Wish Master, to a glinting wall of cameraphones held aloft by hundreds of black and white hands. \u201cAsk any black person here today and they will tell you about racism.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is time to take a stand together and fight this racist system,\u201d urged another woman in the crowd, who joined him on the dusty plinth. \u201cThink about your children. Don\u2019t turn the other cheek. Don\u2019t say it has nothing to do with me. We can change things.\u201d</p> <p>Soon afterwards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/11/edward-colston-statue-retrieved-bristol-harbour-black-lives-matter\">Colston\u2019s hollow bronze effigy</a> was rolled, pushed and dragged a third of a mile by a joyous crowd towards the harbourside. When one group tired of the effort of shifting the half-tonne monument, another took its place. Then the spray-painted, cracked statue was raised upright by what seemed like the collective might of protesters before being tipped over a barrier into the grimy waters below.</p> <p>Few of those people could have imagined that their actions would spark a searching nationwide debate about slavery and colonialism \u2013 which could change the way our cities look, the way we think about our past and spur on further struggles against racism. Yet that is what is now unfolding in towns and cities across the country \u2013 despite signs of a backlash from the far right and senior Conservative political figures, including Boris Johnson.</p> <p>Within days, the statue of another slave trader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/tory-councils-under-pressure-review-monuments-linked-slavery\">Robert Milligan</a>, who owned 526 slaves in Jamaica, was removed from outside the Museum of London Docklands. Liverpool University agreed to rename a student hall of residence named after former prime minister William Gladstone, who opposed abolition in the 1830s (but later called slavery \u201cthe foulest crime\u201d). Meanwhile, thousands of Black Lives Matter protesters, backed by Oxford city council, called for the removal of a memorial in Oriel College to British imperialist Cecil Rhodes, who supported apartheid-style measures in southern Africa.</p> <p>These may be the first of many controversial statues to end up in museums, with carefully curated displays putting them in context rather than being uncritically displayed in streets and squares. London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has set up a commission to review all of the landmarks in the capital. More than 100 Labour councils have <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/press/labour-councils-to-review-all-statues-and-commemorations-in-their-areas-steve-reed/\">pledged</a> to review monuments and statues on public land to ensure they represent local people\u2019s values.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a4c7d25ae9b3df18c6f2840d08e15d5ca1110c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a4c7d25ae9b3df18c6f2840d08e15d5ca1110c8/0_116_4900_2939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The empty plinth in Bristol city centre surrounded by protesters\u2019 banners.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The empty plinth in the city centre surrounded by protesters\u2019 banners.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Bristol, where it all began one week ago, there is a sense of excitement at the possibility of deeper, lasting change, as well as pride among the mainly young anti-racist protesters who finally succeeded where generations of activists had failed. The young women who were central to organising the BLM march in the city on Sunday, which drew some 10,000 supporters, can still barely believe it. \u201cThe impact of it has been insane. It has gone global,\u201d said Yvonne Muringi, 20, who is a student at the University of the West of England. \u201cWe\u2019ve had messages of support from everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Although it was not the aim of the demonstration, she understands why protesters took matters into their own hands, and is pleased Colston ended up in the harbour \u2013 although he has since been fished out by Bristol city council. \u201cPeople have been trying to get it taken down \u2018the right way\u2019 for decades. They\u2019ve been trying long before I was even alive,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they have been completely disregarded and black voices in the city haven\u2019t been heard.\u201d</p> <p>Historians and activists had been campaigning to remove the statue for decades. There were countless petitions, debates and proposals for reworded plaques, but nothing changed.</p> <p>The youngest member of the organising team, Tiffany Lyare, 16, was adamant that Colston\u2019s charitable deeds in no way made up for the transportation of thousands of Africans into slavery. \u201cThe statue was glorifying the acts of a slave trader,\u201d she says. \u201cHe gave some money to schools and good causes but it was blood money.\u201d</p> <p>Some \u2013 especially observers abroad \u2013 have expressed surprise that a slave trader was still standing in a supposedly progressive city such as Bristol, with a plaque that made no mention of the 84,000 people he enslaved and instead declared the monument had been \u201cerected by the citizens of Bristol as a memorial of one of the most wise and virtuous sons of their city\u201d.</p> <p>The statue was actually put up in 1895, more than 170 years after Colston died. The city\u2019s Victorian business and political elites were desperate to pacify increasingly radical stirrings in the lower classes with a unifying civic culture, which harked back to Bristol\u2019s supposed entrepreneurial, seafaring heyday. Professor Madge Dresser \u2013 who is poised to join a new commission set up by the city council to examine Bristol\u2019s past \u2013 said the Victorians settled on Colston due to his apparent record of philanthropy. \u201cThere was a growing threat from organised labour and unskilled labour so they really wanted to rally people around a Bristol figure rather than on class lines,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1c15d2c9322e856efddd6c5575ecf8eeec315bdc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c15d2c9322e856efddd6c5575ecf8eeec315bdc/0_0_4040_1605/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A plan of the layout of a slave ship.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"397\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A plan of the layout of a slave ship.

There were civic processions. Schools were named after him. Flowers were laid at his statue,\u201d said Dresser. \u201cSome of these continued well into the 21st century.\u201d</p> <p>Lawyer Marti Burgess, who chairs the Black South West Network and the St Paul\u2019s carnival, recalled that in the 1980s her brother used to have to walk more than three miles from his school to the statue in a procession to mark Colston\u2019s birthday. \u201cHe was given a Colston bun [a type of cake named after the slave trader] and was brought up to venerate him,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was only in the 90s that we became aware of our history and began pushing for change.\u201d</p> <p>Yet there remains in some quarters of Bristol an attachment to Colston. \u201cPeople might have had their first date under that statue,\u201d says Dresser. \u201cThey are fond of it because they see Colston as a philanthropist.\u201d Some people, she said, had been horrified by the \u201clawlessness\u201d of the statue\u2019s removal.</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/bristol-spoken-most-people-glad-4217554\">online survey </a>of more than 10,000 <em>Bristol Post</em> readers last week found that 61% supported the people who pulled down the statue, with more than half wanting Colston\u2019s name to be removed from all streets, institutions and landmarks in the city. But almost a third wanted no change.</p> <p>Most of Colston\u2019s erstwhile defenders appear to be keeping a low profile or distancing themselves from the man they once glorified. The influential Society of Merchant Venturers, which counted Colston as a member and continues to manage three institutions in the city that bear his name, issued a statement on Friday night backing the removal of the statue.</p> <p>Burgess, who became the first black member of the society this year, said the charitable organisation, which runs nine schools and manages 220 acres of parkland in the city, used to have a display of Colston\u2019s hair and toenails at its headquarters. \u201cIt is ridiculous that an organisation with that influence and power is so unrepresentative of the city.\u201d</p> <p>Few now want to publicly defend a statue of a slave trader. Colston\u2019s most ardent local supporter, councillor Richard Eddy \u2013 who resigned as deputy leader of the Conservative group after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/sep/06/race.conservatives\">brandishing a gollywog doll in 2001</a> \u2013 claimed Colston was a hero to generations of Bristolians. \u201cHe was a hero because of his charitable good works, which still benefit us today,\u201d he said. \u201cThat view has been endorsed in the many emails and calls I\u2019ve had. I certainly wasn\u2019t talking about his involvement in slavery. Obviously, I detest that and I think every human being would.\u201d</p> <p>Bristol\u2019s mayor, Marvin Rees, is trying to walk a tightrope on the issue. \u201cThere\u2019s clearly an incredible excitement and an elation among some people that the statue has been pulled down. I shared it because it was an affront to me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are other people who feel that Colston is integral to what Bristol is and by extension to who they are.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You've got to make a distinction between symbols and real stuff. You can't use symbols to pay the bills</p> <footer> <cite>Marvin Rees, mayor of Bristol</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Although he can\u2019t be seen to condone criminal damage, he is also keen to avoid the simplistic condemnations of the crowd. \u201cThere was one act of criminal damage \u2013 it was focused. If it was mindless it would have just exploded all over the place and there would have been violent confrontations. That didn\u2019t happen. Instead there were 10,000 people focused on one statue. That suggests thought,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Rees is especially irritated by claims that he should have removed the statue earlier. He said that he had far more pressing issues, such as tackling the inequalities that blighted the city. \u201cIt would be a little bit odd after all these decades that you blame the black guy for Colston,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t on my list of priorities. You\u2019ve got to make a distinction between symbols and real stuff. You can\u2019t use symbols to pay the bills.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/13/bristol-mayor-colston-statue-removal-was-act-of-historical-poetry\">Bristol mayor: Colston statue removal was act of 'historical poetry'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bristol is a diverse city, with 16% of the population belonging to a black or minority ethnic group. But it is also one of the most divided cities in the country. The Runnymede Trust <a href=\"https://www.runnymedetrust.org/uploads/CoDE%20Briefing%20Bristol%20v2.pdf\">found</a> in 2017 that ethnic minorities in Bristol faced greater disadvantages in education and employment than the average for England and Wales. Almost everyone in the debate agrees that the structural racism and inequalities that hold back so many non-white people in the city will prove harder to tear down than Colston\u2019s statue.</p> <p>For now, Colston\u2019s dented, metal carcass is being held in an undisclosed location. It is being scrubbed clean of harbour filth ready to display in a museum alongside the grappling rope used to pull it down and some of the 500 banners left around the empty plinth. Many are glad he is no longer spoiling their visits to the centre and there is also some pride that the actions of a Bristol crowd prompted soul-searching elsewhere. \u201cBristol was one of the first cities to catch on to the slave trade and it made a vast fortune,\u201d says Burgess. \u201cIt is therefore fitting that this city has started a debate about racism and history.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>The Premier League has decided that next week, black lives will matter. Or at least, it has decreed \u2013 at the behest of several club captains \u2013 that for the opening round of fixtures when the season resumes next week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/11/premier-league-shirts-to-show-support-for-black-lives-matter-and-nhs-minute-silence-coronavirus\">the phrase \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d can be borne on players\u2019 shirts</a>, in place of their names. It hasn\u2019t formally decided whether black lives will matter beyond next week or for the rest of the season. But rest assured it will be consulting key stakeholders and making an announcement in due course.</p> <p>All flippancy aside, it\u2019s perhaps instructive to mark out the steps that have brought us to this point. In and of itself, the shirt messages are a laughably piffling gesture: a bit of fabric stitched to another bit of fabric, a show of support with the emphasis on the former rather than the latter. Yet it\u2019s a gesture that would still have been inconceivable just a few years ago; perhaps even a few weeks ago, before the killing of George Floyd incited a wave of righteous fury that has challenged the very assumptions and orthodoxies upon which our society was built and in so doing forced all of us \u2013 sport included \u2013 to take a look at ourselves.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/12/sports-organisations-bame-board-members-systemic-racism-sporting-equals-arun-kang\">Sports organisations 'should have 20% BAME board members' to tackle racism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is no sudden awakening. It may feel a little like that from within the world of walled privilege where most of us reside. But for many of the athletes and fans who are now speaking up, this is simply the vocalisation of feelings and thoughts that have been poaching under the surface for some time, held in check by the fear of retribution, by the fear of backlash, by a society and a public discourse that has long cast anti-racism, not racism, as the real disruptive influence.</p> <p>All the same, this is a moment of genuine potential and one that thus needs to go well beyond talking. For the first time, people who have no interest in addressing racial inequalities are being confronted with its effects. A generation that has long revered Churchill as an emancipator and Geoffrey Boycott as the authentic voice of cricket and The Germans episode of Fawlty Towers as the pinnacle of British comedy is seeing its icons winched from their pedestals and given a dunking.</p> <p>And so, here we are: where a Premier League so allergically hostile to the discourse of politics, ethics and human rights that it allowed clubs to be purchased by nation states now feels obliged to align itself publicly against systemic racism, a phenomenon some people will still try to tell you doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s a small step. A clumsy and frustratingly infinitesimal step. But it\u2019s not quite nothing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/11/premier-league-shirts-to-show-support-for-black-lives-matter-and-nhs-minute-silence-coronavirus\">Premier League player names to be replaced on shirts by Black Lives Matter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over recent days no sport and no sporting body has been immune from reckoning, from a conversation about diversity or representation or demographic bias. Indeed, one of the great achievements of the Black Lives Matter movement has been to expose how racism operates in its totality: how an economy built on white exploitation and a self-image built on white supremacy generates white boardrooms and white administrations, how racism sustains itself through the nudge and the wink as much as the assault and the insult, how a well-meant sporting stereotype (\u201cpace, power, physicality\u201d) can spring from the same wilful blindness as a knee in the back of the neck.</p> <p>There has been plenty of talk about personal journeys and education processes, of enlightening some and reminding others of the inequities and iniquities that brought us to this point. Too many white athletes have been prepared to let their black teammates shoulder the burden, hiding behind a black Instagram square and some warm-sounding platitudes. By the same token, it has been deeply encouraging that some have been prepared to go beyond the usual spiel and grapple with these issues head-on. Hector Bellerin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/01/f1-drivers-respond-to-lewis-hamiltons-call-to-condemn-racism-george-floyd\">Daniel Ricciardo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/11/its-just-not-ok-jimmy-anderson-calls-on-cricket-to-raise-bame-representation\">Jimmy Anderson</a> and Jon Rahm \u2013 to name a few \u2013 have all spoken well.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/12/collin-osborne-and-paul-hull-i-dont-see-many-black-players-in-key-roles\">'It doesn\u2019t represent what England is': black coaches on rugby's glass ceiling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That process goes on. It needs to go on every day and every week, once the protests have died down and live sport has started again and the news agenda has moved on. It requires patience and intellectual curiosity and a willingness to look beyond the cosmetic. Addressing the lack of BAME coaches in English football, for example, is the sort of problem that could be fixed in a matter of months. So, too, the lack of non-white directors in major British sporting bodies, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/12/sports-organisations-bame-board-members-systemic-racism-sporting-equals-arun-kang\">as revealed by a Sporting Equals study this week</a>.</p> <p>But chisel away a little deeper and the underlying issues remain untouched. The lack of black football coaches stems in part from a lack of black chief executives and sporting directors and owners. This stems in part from a systematic and racist assumption that black people cannot be trusted with positions of executive or financial power, one that also manifests itself in the lack of black representation in the judiciary, in business, in politics. This, in turn, has its roots in the historical concentration of wealth and power in white hands, often at the expense of enslaved or subjugated black peoples. Try and stitch that to the back of a football shirt.</p> <p>These are not pleasant conversations to have. They feel horrible and uncomfortable, just as they should. They require individuals and organisations to keep talking about racism long beyond the point when people have tired of hearing about it. It won\u2019t be polite. It won\u2019t be easy. But nothing this important ever is.</p>"

With tears in my eyes, I asked for their help.&nbsp;But like everyone else, they backed away and left me alone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/31/being-black-while-in-nature-youre-an-endangered-species\">Being black while in nature: 'You\u2019re an endangered species'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As an African American woman who enjoys spending time outside, I have encountered this reaction \u2013 an absence of any desire, willingness or responsibility to engage \u2013 in both crowded cities and in nature.</p> <p>For black people, navigating both city streets and hiking trails can be charged; at worst, they are fraught terrains where we are at the mercy of someone else\u2019s interpretation of our presence. Too often, by default, black people are perceived as threats to white people\u2019s physical safety.&nbsp;And as a consequence, it is our physical safety that is compromised, as the stories of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/central-park-new-york-white-woman-black-birdwatcher\">Christian Cooper</a>, the birdwatcher who filmed a white woman in Central Park lying to the cops about how he was threatening her (when all he did was ask her to leash her dog), and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, the man who died with a police officer\u2019s knee on his neck, illustrate.</p> <p>I have backpacked around the world and lived in Nepal and Kenya, and I\u2019ve seen how my presence can be challenged or questioned. Earlier that year, when I lived in Seattle, I went hiking on Mt Baker with two white friends.&nbsp;It was a typically cloudy and cool day, and we stopped at the park lodge to warm up.&nbsp;At some point, my friends wandered off while I stood there with my colorful shawl wrapped around me.</p> <p>I began to feel uneasy; I noticed an elderly, white woman staring at me.&nbsp;Suddenly, she jumped (as did I).&nbsp;She then said: \u201cMy dear, I thought you were a beautiful, Indian statue.\u201d&nbsp;I was shocked, as I didn\u2019t know whether to feel complimented (you\u2019re beautiful) or insulted (I wasn\u2019t even real).&nbsp;Not to mention her complete misidentification of my racial and ethnic origins.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Regardless of my age and experience, I still feel unsafe walking outside in the country of my birth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My experiences backpacking through mountain trails and wildlife have forever changed the way I see and engage nature. I have channeled that passion into my work: I completed a PhD in geography, taught classes about the environment in our institutions of higher learning, written about the black experience of the outdoors, served on the national parks advisory board for eight years and work with environmental non-profits and government agencies on diversity and environmental issues.&nbsp;I am invested in finding ways to improve the quality of our relationship with the environment and our relationship to each other. But regardless of my age and experience, I still feel unsafe walking outside in the country of my birth.</p> <p>I wish I could feign surprise at what happened to Christian Cooper when he encountered Amy Cooper in Central Park.&nbsp;I wish I could imagine it to be a blip in the United States\u2019s history; an accident, an outlier, not at all reflective of the truth of how black people are all too often treated.&nbsp;But I can\u2019t.&nbsp;</p> <p>When Amy Cooper threatened to tell the police that \u201can <em>African American</em> man is threatening her life\u201d, she revealed what it\u2019s like to know, deep down in your bones that she would be protected, valued and saved by virtue of her skin color.&nbsp;By calling the police, she exemplified what James Baldwin meant when he said that whiteness is about power.</p> <p>Our outrage as black people is justified.&nbsp;Let me say that again.&nbsp;Our outrage as black people is justified. As the CNN commentator Don Lemon said recently: \u201cThe knee has always been on our neck.\u201d&nbsp;But your outrage, white America, is not enough. What many of us want is fundamental, consequential and absolute change.</p> <p>The response to Amy Cooper by a justifiably angry public \u2013 the demands for her to lose her job, her dog and perhaps some \u201cmembership\u201d in her community \u2013 is frustrating because it leaves me wanting.&nbsp;None of those measures would change the way Christian Cooper or any African American is perceived in any outdoor space, or any space for that matter.</p> <p>The revelations about Christian Cooper having gone to Harvard and how he sits on the board of the New York City Audubon Society (which I\u2019m thrilled to learn) should not matter as much as they seem to. This information helps us understand the passion and commitment he brings to birding. They do not confer his worth. At the end of day, it\u2019s about everyone being protected, valued and if need be, saved, regardless of their station in life.&nbsp;</p> <p>What happened between Amy Cooper and Christian Cooper was, in many ways, simply an echo of what\u2019s always been true in the US about our ability, as black people, to walk in the woods or on a city street.&nbsp;We are all Christian Cooper and George Floyd.&nbsp;</p> <p>What can be done? We should recognize that systemic racism exists on both the streets of our cities and inside our national parks. We have to see full representation at every level in the environmental sector, and we need power structures to shift so that black and brown people are shaping policies and our national conversations. We need predominantly white environmental organizations and academic institutions to be more concerned with how the climate crisis disproportionately impacts black and brown people and give more resources to these communities. We need to change the prison industrial complex and law enforcement, which both undoubtedly shape how black people move through space.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is not about political correctness. These changes must be the product of something learned, understood, believed in and practiced by our institutions, our leaders and our communities.</p> <p>I believe that this country \u2013 which was founded on slavery and stolen land \u2013 can make a different choice, the same way Amy Cooper could have made a different choice. And I can aspire to live in a place where I will not be seen as an anomaly or something to fear or challenge, but instead, am embraced as a reflection of our common humanity that doesn\u2019t deny our differences, but celebrates our possibilities.</p> <ul> <li><p>Carolyn Finney is the author of Black Faces, White Spaces: Reimagining the Relationship of African Americans to the Great Outdoors, and a scholar-in-residence at Middlebury College in Vermont</p></li> <li><p>The opinions expressed here are those of the author.

It just keeps going and going and going,\u201d said Quinyetta McMillon, the mother of Alton Sterling\u2019s eldest son.&nbsp;</p> <p>Sterling was 37 when a white police officer shot him six times as he was selling CDs outside a convenience store in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in 2016. Video of the incident showed the officer shouting profanities at Sterling and threatening him.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cJust like George Floyd pled for his life, Alton pleaded for his life, as well,\u201d McMillon said.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t see it as a racial profiling in the beginning, but as time goes on, now, I see, it\u2019s all a racist issue,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way they talked to him as if he was a dog in the streets, as if he was not a human being.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>The officers involved were never criminally charged. After widespread public protests, the officer who killed Sterling was fired, but he appealed against the decision, and his firing was retracted and he was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/08/02/ex-police-officer-who-killed-alton-sterling-is-allowed-undo-his-firing-resign-instead/\">allowed to resign</a>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>One thing that is different now, McMillon said, is the behavior of the American president.

The decision is a direct response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/george-floyd-protests-enter-third-week\">massive protests</a> that have taken over American cities in the last two weeks, and is a major victory for abolitionist activists who have long fought to disband police and prisons.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cIn Minneapolis and in cities across the US, it is clear that our system of policing is not keeping our communities safe,\u201d said Lisa Bender, the Minneapolis city council president, at the event. \u201cOur efforts at incremental reform have failed, period. Our commitment is to do what\u2019s necessary to keep every single member of our community safe and to tell the truth: that the Minneapolis police are not doing that.

The remaining three council members are broadly supportive of the effort as well, but were not ready to sign on, activists said.&nbsp;While the mayor has oversight over the police, the city council has authority over the budget and policy, and could work to dismantle the department through cuts and ordinances.</p> \n<p>The formal effort to abolish a major-city police department in America and replace it with a different model of safety would have been almost unthinkable even weeks ago and is a testament to the impact of the protests that began with Floyd\u2019s death on 25 May.

People are grounded in the history of policing in a way that has never happened before. It\u2019s visible that police are not able to create safety for communities.\u201d</p> \n<p>The council members are expected to face opposition from law enforcement officials and the police union, though activists emphasize that the veto-proof majority has the authority to move forward regardless of opposition.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear the political will is here, and they can\u2019t stop it,\u201d said Williams, noting that even if police officers opposed the move, a vast majority of them live outside Minneapolis and cannot vote on their elected leaders.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>President <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1269970808329437185\">Donald Trump</a> tweeted his apparent opposition to the Minneapolis move on Monday morning: \u201cLAW &amp; ORDER, NOT DEFUND AND ABOLISH THE POLICE.

It is unclear how quickly this process could move, and what the transition could look like. Supporters are pushing for the council to start with taking money away from the police budget and investing in other government departments, social services and programs, while launching a community process for creating alternative systems.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>An alternative safety model, advocates say,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">can start</a>&nbsp;with finding \u201cnon-police solutions to the problems poor people face\u201d,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.citypages.com/news/minneapolis-city-council-members-consider-disbanding-the-police/570993291\">such as</a>&nbsp;counselors responding to mental health calls and addiction experts responding to drug abuse.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Like many US municipalities, Minneapolis was already facing a budget shortfall due to the Covid-19 crisis, and defunding police could help address some of those gaps. There are a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/be62ee3dee3094f2ecf8f841a198aadd?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP\">handful of examples</a> of governments disbanding troubled local police agencies in the US over the years, though the authorities have had other regional law enforcement entities take over policing.</p> \n<h2>Police reforms around the country</h2> \n<p>While the effort in Minneapolis is the most radical, a number of other US mayors and local leaders have reversed their positions on police funding. The mayor of Los Angeles said he would look to cut as much as $150m from the police this week, just days after he pushed forward a city budget that was increasing it by 7%.</p> \n<p>Following days of protests and widespread accounts of police misconduct in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Sunday that some funding would be moved from the police to \u201cyouth initiatives and social services\u201d. Some council members and others, however, have been pushing for a $1bn divestment from the NYPD.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe41ca84e6d42b481c4cab865a5b8c936ff7b651\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe41ca84e6d42b481c4cab865a5b8c936ff7b651/0_0_3936_2624/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators march against racism and police brutality in Minneapolis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators march against racism and police brutality in Minneapolis.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kerem Yucel/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe details will be worked out in the budget process in the weeks ahead, but I want people to understand that we are committed to shifting resources to ensure that the focus is on our young people,\u201d De Blasio said. \u201cAnd I also will affirm while doing that, we will only do it in a way that we are certain continues to ensure that this city will be safe.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>De Blasio also announced that enforcement of regulations involving street vendors \u2013 many of whom are persons of color and, or immigrants \u2013 should not be handled by police. \u201cCivilian agencies can work on proper enforcement and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do going forward,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HelenGymAtLarge/status/1268893914074775552?s=20\">Philadelphia</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElectRyanDorsey/status/1268909453988020224?s=20\">Baltimore</a>, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/06/04/dc-city-council-janeese-lewis-george-election/\">Washington DC</a>, <a href=\"https://sf.curbed.com/2020/6/5/21281670/sf-mayor-defund-police-black-community-sfpd\">San Francisco</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rvp7OgYQ40zWjyhl15TLouRMCFhZ_ApjuJ5m1HmBurk/edit\">other cities</a>, local policymakers have expressed support for some form of defunding or opposing police budget increases in the last week.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For years, abolitionist groups have advocated for governments to take money away from police and prisons and reinvesting the funds in other services.

Police in America kill more people in days than many other countries do in years.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Amid the current protests, abolitionist groups have <a href=\"https://www.8toabolition.com/\">put forward concrete steps</a> toward dismantling police and prisons, arguing that defunding police is the first move, and that cities need to remove police from schools, repeal laws that \u201ccriminalize survival\u201d such as anti-homelessness policies, provide safe housing for people and more.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2020/06/02/heels-george-floyd-killing-colleges-have-moral-imperative-not-work-local-police\">Colleges</a>, public school&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/minneapolis-public-school-end-police-contract\">systems</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/museums-police-divest-black-lives-matter-1202690076/\">museums</a>&nbsp;and other institutions have also increasingly announced plans to divest from police.</p> \n<p>The Minneapolis announcement could inspire other cities to follow, Williams said: \u201cI do believe we are on the precipice of a major global shift.

There were tense moments, and people throwing things at a police precinct, but \u2013 unlike many other protests across the US last weekend \u2013 there was no violence and no arrests.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not one thing that made [Saturday] turn out the way it did,\u201d Hamm said. \u201cIt\u2019s the history, it\u2019s all the things that happened, here, the people, all of this work.\u201d</p> <p>As images of police ramming their cars into protesters and beating people with clubs were shared thousands of times this weekend, a few videos of law enforcement marching or kneeling with protesters also appeared.</p> <p>These videos \u2013 some from majority black cities like Newark, New Jersey, and Flint, Michigan \u2013 were shared with messages about how police reform and police actions could de-escalate situations and lead to peaceful protests.</p> <p>But the images were also loaded with much more complex histories through which last weekend was a peek into the window.</p> <p>Newark residents like Hamm, for example, had been fighting this kind of violence for decades, including the 1967 riots, when thousands of residents took to the streets to protest about white police using excessive force and killing black civilians.</p> <p>When he became mayor in 2014,&nbsp;Baraka made police reform a priority. He worked with activists lawmakers to form an independent citizen review board of police activities. Newark hired more local and minority police, and trained them to American Civil Liberties Union standards, which limit use of force. Baraka pushed back against the city\u2019s powerful police union.</p> <p>Last year, Newark\u2019s crime rates dropped to an <a href=\"https://www.wnyc.org/story/newark-crime-rates-continue-drop-its-much-about-perception-reality/\">unprecedented</a> low.</p> <p>\u201cThis relationship has been a nurtured one,\u201d Baraka said of bridging the communication gap between police and the Newark community, and that paid off last weekend when the tense protest ended without any arrests. \u201cThe police showed an uncanny level of restraint. They did not come downtown with tanks and body armor.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0563893ee41eeb30706ffdd3a18a9989eee6a4e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0563893ee41eeb30706ffdd3a18a9989eee6a4e2/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters rally against the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd, in Newark, New Jersey, on Saturday.

The event passed off largely peacefully.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeenah Moon/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nor was Newark unique.</p> <p>Less than a hundred miles away in Camden, New Jersey, the police chief, Joe Wysocki, and a handful of other police officers marched with protesters in the county they serve after activist Yolanda Deaver invited them.</p> <p>\u201cAt one point Yolanda was shouting Black Lives Matter, and she kind of looked at me, and I said: \u2018It\u2019s OK, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here,\u201d Wysocki said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Camden, touted by former president Barack Obama as a model for police reform, has also seen sweeping changes to its police force in the past decade. The county has introduced some of the strictest policies in the country regarding how police use force \u2013 strangling and suffocating, the way that police killed George Floyd in Minneapolis, are not tolerated.</p> <p>In Camden, police officers train in simulators that include racial bias testing, and commanders watch body-camera footage regularly and analyze officer behavior. Last year, the Minneapolis commissioner, John Harrington, who oversees community policing, even consulted with the Camden police to learn their protocols.</p> <p>But truly reforming the police often takes more than training, said Sam Sinyangwe, a data scientist and activist who co-founded Campaign Zero, a platform which<a href=\"https://www.joincampaignzero.org/\"> tracks</a> the impact of police violence and possible solutions. \u201cEven if you have a police chief or mayor who cares, they don\u2019t always have the power to hold the officers accountable,\u201d he said.</p> <p>There are a few policies that Sinyangwe said the evidence supports. There is not enough data, Sinyangwe said, to say that anti-bias training and classes are a solution. Instead, he points to strong restrictions on how police can use force, curbing the military-grade weapons distributed to the police and cracking down on police union contracts.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is also an increasingly important conversation about defunding the police, which lawmakers such as Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez have resurfaced this week. The $6bn New York police department, for example, is bigger than the city\u2019s budget for many housing, education and health initiatives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"309de1260912d3660f20cd41eafb10943daa4e08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/309de1260912d3660f20cd41eafb10943daa4e08/0_159_591_739/400.jpg\" alt=\"New York police officers kneel along with protesters after protesters said they asked them to do so, in this still frame obtained from social media video in Queens, New York, on Sunday.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New York police officers kneel along with protesters in Queens, New York, on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aleeia Abraham/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPart of police violence is policing of things that shouldn\u2019t be policed,\u201d Sinyangwe said, such as sending police to people having mental health crises. \u201cTo do that we have to make a divestment from policing and shift those resources.\u201d</p> <p>Without a cocktail of comprehensive policies and accountability, some of the police efforts to express solidarity have been less effective. When New York police kneeled at a protest on Sunday, some pointed out that they went on to use brutal force against residents an hour later.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Flint, Michigan, Sheriff Chris Swanson joined the protest last weekend, saying he wanted it to be a \u201cparade not a protest\u201d. The video went viral, and residents were relieved that nobody in the city, which is still dealing with a water and economic crisis, got hurt. But some said that the message felt like it only took away from the focus of the protest on George Floyd, especially since the community\u2019s relationship with the police was not strong.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people know that Flint has an understaffed police force. They\u2019re not really present,\u201d said Anthony Fisher, a 21-year-old student and native of the city. \u201cIt\u2019s a good gesture, but some people get carried away.\u201d</p> <p>For Hamm, in Newark, it was clear the uprising and unrest happening across the country is a culmination of years of police brutality against black communities. He said his group, which has held weekly protests on the issue for years, and its relationship with city leaders and clergy, set the stage for a demonstration that represented Newark.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWhen we marched there was already a kind of set of conditions in existence that would help prevent some sort of disturbance,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the power of George Floyd. The way he died has had a tremendous impact on people\u2019s consciousness.\u201d</p>"

That steady increase comes as crime has been consistently declining. In most cities, spending on police is <a href=\"https://populardemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Freedom%20To%20Thrive%2C%20Higher%20Res%20Version.pdf\">significantly greater</a> than spending on services and other departments ($1.8bn on police in Los Angeles, for example, which is <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-04/lapd-budget-cuts-garcetti-protests-explainer\">more than half</a> the city\u2019s general fund). The Covid-19 economic crisis has led cities and states to make drastic budget <a href=\"https://www.changethenypd.org/nycbudgetjustice\">cuts</a> to education, youth programs, arts and culture, parks, libraries, housing services and more.

In LA, Black Lives Matter has been pushing for a \u201c<a href=\"https://peoplesbudgetla.com/\">people\u2019s budget</a>\u201d that allocates just 5.7% of the general fund to law enforcement, instead of the 51% of the mayor\u2019s plan. More broadly, longstanding abolitionist groups, <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59ead8f9692ebee25b72f17f/t/5b65cd58758d46d34254f22c/1533398363539/CR_NoCops_reform_vs_abolition_CRside.pdf\">such as Critical Resistance</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mpd150.com/10-action-ideas-for-building-a-police-free-future/\">MPD 150</a>, argue that the cities should not be looking for minor savings and cuts, but should be fundamentally reducing the scale and size of the police force and dismantle the traditional law enforcement system. That <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">can start</a> with finding \u201cnon-police solutions to the problems poor people face\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.citypages.com/news/minneapolis-city-council-members-consider-disbanding-the-police/570993291\">such as</a> counselors responding to mental health calls and addiction experts responding to drug abuse.&nbsp;</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/defund-the-police-us-george-floyd-budgets\">Movement to defund police gains 'unprecedented' support across US</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>If cities defund police, will violence and crime increase?&nbsp;</strong></h2> \n<p>Abolition groups argue that policing and prison are at their core racist and harmful and make communities less safe. They also point out that the vast majority of police work has nothing to do with responding to or preventing violence, and that police have <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2015/03/30/395069137/open-cases-why-one-third-of-murders-in-america-go-unresolved\">a terrible track record</a> of solving murders or handling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/10/sexual-assault-rape-kit-backlog-ignored-destroyed\">rape</a> and <a href=\"https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/public-safety/police-officers-who-commit-domestic-violence-often-get-to-keep-their-guns/\">domestic violence</a>.</p> \n<p>While there is no contemporary example of defunding in the US, there are studies suggesting that less policing could mean less crime. In 2014 and 2015, New York officers staged a \u201cslowdown\u201d to protest the mayor, arguing that if they did less police work, the city would be less safe. But <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/09/nyc-cops-did-a-work-stop-yet-crime-dropped/\">the opposite turned out to be true</a>. When the officers took a break from \u201cbroken windows policing\u201d, meaning targeting low-level offenses, there <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-proactive-policing-crime-20170925-story.html\">was a drop in crime</a>. Researchers posited that aggressive policing on the streets for petty matters can ultimately cause social disruption and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/09/nyc-cops-did-a-work-stop-yet-crime-dropped/\">lead to more crime</a>. Policing that <a href=\"https://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/the-high-cost-of-driving-while-poor/Content?oid=4269240\">punishes poverty</a>, such as hefty traffic tickets and debts, can also create conditions where crime is more likely. When New York ended \u201cstop and frisk\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/ending-new-yorks-stop-and-frisk-did-not-increase-crime\">crime did not rise</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>How are police unions responding to defunding calls?&nbsp;</strong></h2> \n<p>America\u2019s powerful police unions have <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/melissasegura/police-unions-history-minneapolis-reform-george-floyd\">long resisted even minor reforms</a> and accountability measures, and are predictably arguing, without evidence, that <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.com/2020/06/05/lapd-police-union-blasts-mayor-garcettis-killers-comment-and-proposed-budget-cuts/\">budget cuts</a> at any scale will make cities less safe. They\u2019ve <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/defund-police-ridiculous-idea-joe-gamaldi\">cited</a> looting and property damage amid protests this week to suggest that cities don\u2019t have enough officers. Defunding advocates, however, have pointed out that the highly militarized response to peaceful demonstrations and the aggressive and at times violent ways officers are handling protesters has only provided further evidence that police cause harm (when there is no public safety threat in the first place).&nbsp;</p> \n<h2><strong>Are there examples of police defunding that US cities can follow?&nbsp;</strong></h2> \n<p>America\u2019s legacy of racism and severe gun violence epidemic make it difficult to compare to other countries. But <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/defund-police/612682/\">some have pointed out</a> that compared to peer nations, the US spends significantly less on social services and more on public safety programs, and has astronomically higher incarceration rates. These investments in police and prison, however, don\u2019t translate to a safer country. In fact, police in America <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/09/the-counted-police-killings-us-vs-other-countries\">kill more people in days</a> than many countries do in years.&nbsp;</p>"

She instructed the Pierce county sheriff to review the actions taken by the officers on the scene.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/david-mcatee-louisville-protests-family\">\u2018I cannot stand it\u2019: family of Louisville man shot dead by police speak out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe officers who committed this crime should be fired and prosecuted to the full extent of the law,\u201d said Woodards in a late-night press conference on Thursday after the video was released.</p> <p>The video, captured by a woman whose name has not been released, appears to show two officers repeatedly punching a man lying on the ground. The woman can be heard screaming from her car: \u201cStop. Oh my God, stop hitting him. Just arrest him.\u201d</p> <p>The death of Ellis, a musician and father of two, has been ruled a homicide and is being investigated by the Pierce county sheriff\u2019s department. The county medical examiner\u2019s officer reported that he died due to hypoxia and physical restraint. Other factors that may have contributed to his death included methamphetamine intoxication and heart disease.</p> <p>The four officers involved were placed on administrative leave following the arrest. The Tacoma police department said in a statement that they returned to full duty once it was determined \u201cthere were no known departmental violations\u201d. Earlier this week they were placed again on administrative leave.</p> <p>On Friday, the Tacoma city council unanimously approved sending a letter to the governor, Jay Inslee, requesting an independent review of Ellis\u2019s death. The letter was in response to Ellis\u2019s family pushing for a thorough and independent investigation involving the state.<br><br>During the council meeting, Woodards also highlighted the need for the system to change, referencing the fact that she and the governor would look into establishing an independent review process for every officer-involved death in Washington.</p> <p>Ed Troyer, the Pierce county sheriff\u2019s spokesman, told the Guardian that the Tacoma police officers had noticed Ellis banging on car windows. When he came up to their car asking for help and saying there were warrants out for his arrest, an officer got out of the car.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ellis grabbed him by his vest and threw him to the ground, according to Troyer. The second officer then came out of the car and wrestled him into handcuffs. He was lying on the ground when he started saying he couldn\u2019t breathe. The officers turned him on to his side and called for medical units.</p> <p>The&nbsp;Washington senator Patty Murray said in a tweet on Thursday that her \u201cheart goes out to Manuel Ellis\u2019 family, those who loved him &amp; his community\u201d, and said she supported Inslee\u2019s push for an independent investigation.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ellis was a father to an 18-month-old daughter and 11-year-old son, according to a GoFundMe account created five days ago by Monet Carter-Mixon, Ellis\u2019s sister, and Black Lives Matter Seattle King county. As of Friday, the page had raised over $46,000.</p> <p>\u201cWe are proud of the man Manuel became, like so many black men in our community, his greatest achievements were grounded in his ability to transform trauma and personal struggles into victories,\u201d the fundraiser says.</p>"

In many states, governors have activated national guard units.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the president repeatedly warned governors against being \u201coverridden\u201d and argued that if they did not dominate protesters, \u201cyou\u2019re wasting your time, they are gonna run over you, you\u2019re going to look like a bunch of jerks.\u201d</p> <p>Trump repeatedly blasted New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, cities with Democratic mayors, in states with Democratic governors.</p> <p>\u201cNew York is going to have to toughen up,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll send you national guard if you want. What\u2019s going on in New York is terrible, it\u2019s terrible.</p> <p>\u201cPhiladelphia, you gotta toughen up \u2026 You\u2019ve got a big national guard out there that\u2019s ready to come out and fight like hell.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump also repeatedly praised Minnesota governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, who he said \u201cknocked [protesters] out so fast it was like bowling pins\u201d. He also said Phil Murphy, another Democrat, \u201cdid a very good job in New Jersey\u201d.</p> <p>The president described Minnesota as \u201cour experiment\u201d in how to handle the protests.</p> <p>\u201cYou had the first part which was weak and pathetic,\u201d he said, \u201cand you had the second part which was domination.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also urged that states should enact laws against flag burning \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/background-flag-desecration-amendment#:~:text=Johnson.,protected%20form%20of%20free%20speech.\">first amendment right</a>.</p> <p>Trump repeatedly said the protesters were from the \u201cradical left\u201d and likened the protests to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/occupy-wall-street\">Occupy Wall Street</a> movement in 2011, speaking favourably of how those protests were forcibly put down.</p> <p>The response was mixed. Maine governor Janet Mills asked for Trump and his team to share intelligence on \u201cprofessional instigators\u201d from out of state, but also expressed concern about an upcoming visit by Trump.</p> <p>West Virginia governor Jim Justice, a Republican, said: \u201cYou come to West Virginia. We\u2019re not going to have a problem here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, now that sounds a lot different than the governor of Maine,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think she talked me into it. She doesn\u2019t know me very well.\u201d</p> <p>Illinois governor JB Pritzker said he was \u201cextraordinarily concerned\u201d by Trump\u2019s rhetoric surrounding Floyd\u2019s death, which he said was \u201cmaking it worse\u201d.</p> <p>Trump shot back that he didn\u2019t like the Democrat\u2019s \u201crhetoric either\u201d and said he had repeatedly addressed his horror over Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>Others supported Trump. Arizona governor Doug Ducey said \u201cthe more aggressive approach does work\u201d. Maryland governor Larry Hogan said \u201cI agree in peace through strength.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s theme was crush, or be crushed.</p> <p>\u201cThey come armed with bricks,\u201d he said. \u201cThey come armed with bricks and rocks.\u201d</p> <p>Former vice-president Joe Biden, the de facto Democratic presidential nominee, in contrast sought advice from mayors including Atlanta\u2019s<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/17/atlanta-mayor-keisha-lance-bottoms-coronavirus\">Keisha Lance Bottoms</a>, Chicago\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/02/chicago-lori-lightfoot-elected-first-black-female-mayor\">Lori Lightfoot</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/31/george-floyd-protests-latest-news-riots-us-cities-donald-trump-police-brutality-live?page=with:block-5ed3ab628f087122eca52ceb#block-5ed3ab628f087122eca52ceb\">Melvin Carter</a> of St Paul, Minneapolis\u2019s \u201ctwin city\u201d, who are all African American, on balancing \u201ckeeping people safe\u201d while \u201cacknowledging the incredible pain and anger that is the root of these protests\u201d.</p> <p>Biden said on Monday: \u201cPeople are angry. I\u2019m angry. And the fact is we need that anger, we need that to tell us to move forward, it helps us push through this pain to reach the other side, to hopefully greater progress, equality and inclusion and opportunity in our country.\u201d</p> <p>Across the country, protests have been mostly peaceful by day but some have turned violent at night, buildings set ablaze, shops looted, police firing rubber bullets and teargas. At least 4,400 arrests have been made, according to the Associated Press.</p> <p>The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced that there would be a curfew mandated for New York City Monday night 11pm until 5am Tuesday, and a doubling of policing.</p> <p>A man was killed in Louisville, Kentucky, after police and national guardsmen \u201creturned fire\u201d&nbsp;while dispersing a crowd. Democratic governor&nbsp;Andy Beshear&nbsp;said the incident would be investigated. In Indianapolis, two were reported dead, adding to deaths in Detroit and Minneapolis.</p> <p>Trump is facing widespread criticism for tweets starkly demanding \u201claw and order\u201d, threatening to unleash \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and blaming fringe leftwing groups for inciting violence.</p> <p>The president, also grappling with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic, did not appear in public on Sunday and was not scheduled to do so on Monday. There have been protests outside the White House for three days in a row. On Friday, Trump, his wife, Melania, and their son Barron were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/trump-flees-to-bunker-as-protests-over-george-floyd-rage-outside-white-house\">rushed to</a>&nbsp;a bunker previously used during terrorist attacks.</p> <p>On Sunday, after a peaceful daytime protest, police and national guardsmen faced supporters as an 11pm curfew approached, and then advanced firing teargas. Lights illuminating the White House were turned off, which typically only occurs<strong> </strong>when a president dies.</p> <p>Minneapolis had a largely quiet night after the police vigorously enforced an 8pm curfew, shutting all main highways through the city. A lot of side streets were shut off by makeshift barricades erected by residents seeking to protect their homes. The police blocked junctions.</p> <p>Only a small number of people appeared to defy the curfew, including a group of several hundred who maintained a vigil at the place where Floyd was held for nearly nine minutes with police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on his neck. The street is now a memorial filled with flowers.</p> <p>On Monday the family of George Floyd, 46, released the results of a private autopsy they arranged, which concluded that Floyd died by homicide caused by \u201casphyxiation by sustained force\u201d. They called for the third-degree murder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">charge</a> against former officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck, to be upgraded to a first-degree charge and for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-killing-three-officers-charges\">three other officers</a> involved to be arrested for \u201cthe part they played\u201d in the man\u2019s death.</p> <p>Last week preliminary results of the official autopsy, released by the county medical examiner, had found that Floyd\u2019s died because of the \u201ccombined effects of Mr. Floyd\u2019s being restrained by police, underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system\u201d.</p> <p>Elsewhere, though, violence returned. In Birmingham, Alabama, a Confederate statute was toppled. Protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails in Philadelphia and were hit with teargas in Austin, Texas. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalised.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, offered advice to the protesters.</p> <p>\u201cIf, going forward, we can channel our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action, then this moment can be a real turning point in our nation\u2019s long journey to live up to our highest ideals,\u201d he wrote in a Medium post.</p>"

A group of teachers marched in downtown Manhattan holding up a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emma_a_whitford/status/1269299214267355141?s=20\">banner</a> that read \u201cBlack Students Matter\u201d and signs demanding an end to the school-to-prison pipeline.</p> <p>A demonstration packed Washington Square Park with thousands later in the afternoon.</p> <p>Protests unfolded in many other cities as the day continued.</p> <p>Thousands marched through the streets of Chicago, chanting and waving signs. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said she was hopeful that peaceful protests would continue through the weekend, but a nightly curfew remained in effect. The city also hired three private security firms to protect shops, grocery stores and pharmacies.</p> <p>In Philadelphia, thousands of people demanding justice for Floyd marched peacefully through the city chanting \u201cNo justice, no peace!\u201d Demonstrators gathered near the Philadelphia Museum of Art and its celebrated \u201cRocky\u201d steps, then set off for city hall, where they chanted at police officers and national guard members.<br><br>About 100 protesters gathered at Donald Trump\u2019s golf resort just outside Miami in a protest organized by Latinos for Black Lives Matter. Many carried signs saying \u201cvote him out\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t be a bunker boy\u201d, the latter a reference to reports that the president went into the White House bunker when protests in Washington grew more violent.</p> <p>While previous days of protests have seen violent crackdowns from police against protestors, Saturday\u2019s huge demonstrations have so far appeared peaceful as huge crowds move through their city\u2019s streets.</p> <p>In North Carolina, a hearse carrying Floyd\u2019s body arrived Saturday morning for a public viewing of his casket and private memorial held in Hoke county in the southern state. Hundreds of people from the area came to pay their respects. A group of mourners on horseback visited the church in tribute to Floyd.</p> <p>Floyd was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina \u2013 a city just east of Hoke county. Though he spent much of his life in Houston, much of Floyd\u2019s family is still there, the Charlotte Observer <a href=\"https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article243301776.html\">reported</a>. Only family members were invited to a funeral to be held in the afternoon, though it was broadcasted live.</p> <p>The governor of North Carolina ordered flags to be raised at half-staff on Saturday in Floyd\u2019s honor.&nbsp;</p> <p>The memorial in North Carolina is Floyd\u2019s second. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/george-floyd-memorial-minneapolis\">memorial</a> was held at a university in Minneapolis, two miles from where Floyd was killed. A third and final <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/06/02/george-floyd-funeral-memorial-services-burial-planned-three-states/3122453001/\">memorial</a> will be held in Houston, where Floyd will be laid to rest.</p> <p>Meanwhile, two Buffalo police officers pleaded not guilty to assault&nbsp;after video emerged of them&nbsp;<a href=\"https://content.guardianapis.com/atom/media/dbefd615-3a3a-42d6-ba32-25d1000dda85\">pushing a 75-year-old</a>&nbsp;to the ground during protests over Floyd\u2019s death. The man was shown bleeding after striking his head as he fell.</p> <p>When the police officers left the court building earlier on Saturday, they were greeted by dozens of their colleagues who were cheering for them.</p> <p>Aaron Torgalski and Robert McCabe have both been suspended over the incident, which was viewed millions of times on social media and triggered widespread rage. Buffalo police initially said the man had tripped during a confrontation but the city\u2019s mayor later condemned the incident.</p>"

Chauvin is facing murder and manslaughter charges, and the three other officers have been fired.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is not being told is the violent criminal history of George Floyd. The media will not air this. I\u2019ve worked with the four defense attorneys that are representing each of our four terminated individuals under criminal investigation, in addition with our labor attorneys to fight for their jobs. They were terminated without due process,\u201d wrote Kroll, according to a copy of the letter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StribJany/status/1267471624397361162\">obtained by the Star Tribune</a>.</p> <p>Floyd had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-who-was-he-his-friends-words\">served time in prison</a> for aggravated robbery but Chauvin could not have known that when he detained him. Video footage shows that Floyd was not behaving in a violent manner during his arrest, was not armed, and was not suspected of a violent crime.</p> <p>Following Governor Tim Walz\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/minneapolis-protests-george-floyd-outsiders-looting\">characterisation</a> of the protests as led by outside agitators, Kroll described the demonstrators as organised extremists.</p> <p>\u201cThis terrorist movement that is currently occurring was a long time build up which dates back years,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At the weekend, Walz claimed that 80% of those arrested during the protests were from out of state and implied they were an organised movement intent on disrupting governance. But arrest records show his claim was false. In fact, 80% were from Minnesota and half of them were from Minneapolis.</p> <p>While groups of young white people dressed all in black were highly visible in confrontations with the police, alongside young African Americans angered by Floyd\u2019s death, large numbers of the people involved in looting several miles of Lake street in south Minneapolis were evidently from the surrounding area.</p> <p>Former Minneapolis police chief Jane\u00e9 Harteau swiftly condemned Kroll in a tweet, and suggested that the letter reflected the attitudes that had blocked her efforts at reform of the police department.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChiefHarteau/status/1267460683408564225\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A disgrace to the badge!

It is despicable behavior. How our command staff can tolerate it and live with themselves I do not know.\u201d</p> <p>But Kroll praised the city\u2019s police officers.</p> <p>\u201cNo one with the exception of us is willing to recognize and acknowledge the extreme bravery you have displayed through this riot. You have my utmost respect,\u201d he said.</p>"

We need air to breathe. The killing of Mr Floyd was an absolute truth, that it was wrong, and so I did not need days or weeks or months or processes or bureaucracies to tell me that what occurred out here last Monday was wrong.</p> <p>\u201cThis was a violation of humanity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a violation of the oath that the majority of the men and women that put this uniform on [take] \u2013 this goes absolutely against it. This is contrary to what we believe in. What occurred to me, it was an absolute truth that it was wrong, period.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking to the police chief, Floyd asked if he would \u201cget justice for my brother\u201d.</p> <p>Removing his hat, Arradondo said: \u201cBeing silent or not intervening, to me, you\u2019re complicit. So I don\u2019t see a level of distinction that\u2019s any different. Obviously the charging and those decisions have to come through our county attorney\u2019s office, certainly the FBI is investigating that, but I want you to know my decision to fire all four officers was not based on some sort of hierarchy.</p> <p>\u201cMr Floyd died in our hands, and so I see that as being complicit \u2026 I don\u2019t see a difference in terms of the ultimate outcome, [which] is he is not here with us \u2026 Silence and inaction \u2013 you\u2019re complicit. If there were one solitary voice that would have intervened and acted, that\u2019s what I would have hoped for. That did not occur.\u201d</p> <p>Floyd replied: \u201cThey arrest guys every day. They had enough evidence to fire them, so they have enough evidence to arrest them. I don\u2019t know who he\u2019s talking to, but I need him to do it, because we all are listening. Black lives matter.\u201d</p> <p>Floyd\u2019s attorney, Ben Crump, said Arradondo had been \u201cvery respectful to the family and we thank him for that\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBlack Americans keeps getting killed by police and nobody\u2019s held accountable. It\u2019s an expression of righteous anger that people are expressing all across America. But even as much pain as Philonise is going through, he\u2019s still asking people to be peaceful because we don\u2019t want innocent people to be affected.\u201d</p> <p>CNN also spoke to the mother of Ahmaud Arbery, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/ahmaud-arbery-police-taser-2017-georgia\">killed in Georgia in February</a> by two white men while he was out for a run. Video of the killing went viral months later, prompting local authorities to act.</p> <p>\u201cIt really breaks my heart that it\u2019s come to this, but I truly understand where protesters are coming from\u201d said Wanda Cooper. \u201cBlack lives are being lost, and they\u2019re being lost for no reason.\u201d</p>"

     "body": "<p>It is 1972, and Angela Davis is answering a question about whether she approves of the use of violence by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/05/how-hollywood-feted-the-black-power-movement-and-fell-foul-of-the-fbi\">the Black Panthers</a>. She is sitting against a backdrop of powder-blue breeze blocks, the walls of a California state prison cell. Dressed in a red turtleneck, with her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/oct/19/black-hair-why-its-time-to-stop-politicising-it\">signature afro</a> and a lit cigarette, she stares at the Swedish interviewer \u2013 almost straight through him \u2013 as she delivers her reply: \u201cYou ask me whether I approve of violence? That just doesn\u2019t make any sense at all. Whether I approve of guns? I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama. Some very, very good friends of mine were killed by bombs \u2013 bombs that were planted by racists. I remember, from the time I was very small, the sound of bombs exploding across the street and the house shaking \u2026 That\u2019s why, when someone asks me about violence, I find it incredible because it means the person asking that question has absolutely no idea what black people have gone through and experienced in this country from the time the first black person was kidnapped from the shores of Africa.\u201d</p> \n<p>Watching the short clip explains Davis the icon in an instant: the image, the intent, the intellect. She was immortalised in the 2011 documentary<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/20/black-power-mixtape-film-review\"> The Black Power Mixtape</a>, and clips of the interview have been shared on social media as the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer has triggered global protests against police violence. Her 1981 book, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/opinion/george-floyd-protests-race.html\">Women, Race and Class</a>, is being shared widely as essential reading for anyone wanting to learn about being actively anti-racist, alongside James Baldwin\u2019s The Fire Next Time and the autobiography of Frederick Douglass.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9f3809ccea525483512c91a371899906004c22b3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f3809ccea525483512c91a371899906004c22b3/188_455_3743_2245/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Davis \u2026 \u2018We\u2019ve never witnessed sustained demonstrations of this size that are so diverse.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angela Davis \u2026 \u2018We\u2019ve never witnessed sustained demonstrations of this size that are so diverse.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Agencia Efe/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Now 76, she speaks over Zoom from her office in California. Does she feel now that, after so many years, meaningful change is possible? \u201cWell, of course, it could be different,\u201d says Davis. \u201cBut that\u2019s not guaranteed.\u201d It\u2019s an understandably cautious tone from Davis, who has seen everything from the Watts riots and Vietnam to Ferguson and Iraq. \u201cAfter many moments of dramatic awareness and possibilities of change, the kinds of reforms instituted in the aftermath have prevented the radical potential from being realised.\u201d</p> \n<p>She is, on the whole, buoyed up by the vast protests triggered by Floyd\u2019s death. Although there have been large-scale protests as recently as 2014 \u2013 after the death of Michael Brown, and others including Tamir Rice, Sandra Bland and Eric Garner \u2013 Davis thinks that this time, something has changed. This time, white people are beginning to understand.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never witnessed sustained demonstrations of this size that are so diverse,\u201d says Davis. \u201cSo I think that is what is giving people a great deal of hope. Many people previously, in response to the slogan Black Lives Matter, asked: \u2018But shouldn\u2019t we really be saying all lives matter?\u2019 They\u2019re now finally getting it. That as long as black people continue to be treated in this way, as long as the violence of racism remains what it is, then no one is safe.\u201d</p> \n<p>If anyone is qualified to make an assessment on the current situation, it is Davis. She has spent five decades as an intellectual campaigning for racial justice, yet the causes she has pursued \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/6/9/21281538/how-to-donate-to-black-lives-matter-charity\">prison reform</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">defunding the police</a>, restructuring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/29/california-bail-jails-coronavirus-criminal-justice\">the bail system</a> \u2013 had, until recently, been considered too radical for mainstream political thinking. There was a feeling that she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/08/usa.gender\">frozen in time</a>; that she belonged to a 60s brand of so-called <a href=\"https://nymag.com/news/features/46170/\">radical chic</a> and that her ideas were outmoded. In a profile written in 2016, a Wall Street Journal interviewer asked colleagues if they knew who Davis was.<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/angela-davis-and-radical-chic-2016-1465254392\"> No one under 35 did</a>. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"130724d9-7d5b-4d8f-9473-5ff88e639af2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xg6YV_5Om3s?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Davis may have become a pinup for social justice 50 years after she rose to prominence, but she insists she gets just as much out of the new generation of protesters and political thinkers. \u201cI see these young people who are so intelligent, who have learned from the past and who have developed new ideas,\u201d she says. \u201cI find myself learning a great deal from people who are 50 years younger than me. And to me, that\u2019s exciting. That keeps me wanting to remain in the struggle.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s really important to point out that, while the immensity of this response is new, the struggles are not new,\u201d she says. Davis doesn\u2019t want the impact of community organising, educational workshops and food banks \u2013 the grassroots work pioneered by the Black Panthers in the 60s \u2013 to be ignored now. \u201cThe struggles have been unfolding for a long time,\u201d she adds. \u201cWhat we are seeing now bears witness to the work that people have been doing that has not necessarily received media attention.\u201d</p> \n<p>Davis cites the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2018/aug/19/the-whole-world-is-watching-chicago-police-riot-vietnam-war-regan\">militarisation of the US police after Vietnam</a>, and the potential for prison reform after the Attica prison uprising in 1971, which did not materialise, at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/22/new-attica-documents-reveal-inmate-torture\">not in the way she imagined</a>. Prison populations in the US exploded from around 200,000 at the time of Attica to over a million prisoners by the mid-90s. \u201cLooking back at that period, we realised that the reforms actually helped to consolidate the institution itself and to make it more permanent,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that is the fear right now.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a4a255b670b98aaee1a90285205114587df2d7b3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4a255b670b98aaee1a90285205114587df2d7b3/8_187_1696_2118/801.jpg\" alt=\"Davis in 1974, with her signature look.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Davis in 1974, with her signature look.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/REX/Everett Collection/Rex</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>So what advice would she give the Black Lives Matter movement? \u201cThe most important thing from where I stand is to begin to give expression to ideas about what we can do next,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>This is, of course, a big question, and a harder one to answer in the heat of growing protests around the world. One thing Davis is clear on is that moments such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/may/29/minneapolis-police-station-set-ablaze-george-floyd-demonstrations-video\">the burning of a police precinct in Minneapolis</a> or the removal of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\">Edward Colston statue in Bristol</a> aren\u2019t the ultimate answer. \u201cRegardless of what people think about it, it\u2019s really not going to bring about change,\u201d she says of the statue\u2019s removal. \u201cIt\u2019s organising. It\u2019s the work. And if people continue to do that work, and continue to organise against racism and provide new ways of thinking about how to transform our respective societies, that is what will make the difference.\u201d</p> \n<p>Angela Yvonne Davis was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1944. At the time, Alabama was controlled by the notorious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/12/alabama-1963-unseen-photographs-civil-rights-montgomery-colin-jones\">white supremacist politician Bull Connor</a>. Davis was friends with some of those who died in the 16th Street Baptist church bombing in 1963 \u2013 a Ku Klux Klan act of terrorism that killed four girls, and for which no prosecutions were brought until 1977. \u201cWe knew that the role of the police was to protect white supremacy,\u201d says Davis.</p> \n<p>She moved to New York at 15 to attend high school there, went to West Germany to study philosophy and Marxism under<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/15/frankfurt-school-herbert-marcuse\"> Herbert Marcuse at the Frankfurt school</a>, and, back in the US by the end of the 60s, was active in the Black Panthers and a member of the Communist party. Her links to communism meant that the then California governor, Ronald Reagan, had her sacked from her<strong> </strong>position as <a href=\"https://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/angela-davis-returns-to-ucla-classroom-45-years-after-controversy\">acting assistant professor of philosophy at UCLA</a>.</p> \n<p>Then, in 1970, things shifted gears. A shotgun Davis legally bought was used in an attempted courthouse escape. A judge who was taken hostage was killed, as was Jonathan Jackson \u2013 the student who attempted the breakout \u2013 and the two defendants. Davis was charged with \u201caggravated kidnapping and first degree murder\u201d because she had purchased the gun. She went underground and was arrested in New York. Aretha Franklin helped publicise her case by offering to pay her bail, the Rolling Stones and John Lennon wrote songs about her, she became a cause celebre around the world and was cleared of the charges after spending 18 months in prison. It turned Davis from a radical academic and community leader into an international figurehead for political activism of all stripes. \u201cI\u2019m really thankful that I\u2019m still alive,\u201d says Davis. \u201cBecause I feel like I\u2019m witnessing this for all of those who didn\u2019t make it this far.\u201d</p> \n<p>Davis knows how close she came to not surviving. When the 1972 interview took place, she was still being held on a charge of murder and could \u2013 in theory \u2013 have been executed. Many of Davis\u2019s fellow Panthers did meet violent deaths at the hands of the state: Fred Hampton was killed in a police raid in Chicago, while Bobby Hutton was shot while surrendering in Oakland (Marlon Brando delivered his eulogy). Many more are still in prison (Mumia Abu-Jamal) or exile (Assata Shakur). \u201cI know that I could have been one of those \u2026 several didn\u2019t make it,\u201d says Davis. \u201cI could be in prison, I could have been sentenced to spend the rest of my life behind bars. And it was only because of the organising that unfolded all over the world that my life was saved. So, in a sense, my continued work is based on the awareness that I would not be here had enough people not done the same kind of work for me. And I\u2019ll continue to do this until the day I die.\u201d</p> \n<p>One of the key tenets of Davis\u2019s post-prison life has been ensuring women\u2019s contribution to the civil-rights struggle is not ignored. That\u2019s something she sees echoed today, as people fight for female victims of police violence \u2013 people such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/breonna-taylor-louisville-protest-george-floyd\">Breonna Taylor</a>, who was shot and killed by police in Louisville, Kentucky, after they used a battering ram to enter her apartment \u2013 to be given the same coverage as their male counterparts. \u201cThis masculinisation of history goes back many decades and centuries,\u201d says Davis. \u201cDiscussions about lynching, for example, often fail to acknowledge not only that many of the lynching victims were black women, but also that those who struggled against lynching were black women, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/27/ida-b-wells-civil-rights-movement-reporter\">Ida B Wells</a>.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"198f8c373ae4408fbc5f0172940aab3d11345c27\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/198f8c373ae4408fbc5f0172940aab3d11345c27/0_95_3135_1881/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Campaigning against the Vietnam war with Jane Fonda.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Campaigning against the Vietnam war with Jane Fonda.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ullstein Bild/ullstein bild via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s important to understand why this tendency towards masculine representations of struggle happen, and why we fail to recognise that women have forever been at the centre of these struggles, whether as victims or organisers.\u201d</p> \n<p>It\u2019s not just Davis\u2019s ideas on police reform and social justice that are taking hold; her ideas on how that change comes about are proving equally influential. For decades, she has promoted feminist thinking that pushes back against hypermasculine political leadership and forms of resistance. She thinks the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/occupy\">Occupy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> movements, which have not put an emphasis on or \u2013 in some cases \u2013 even formed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/13/leaderless-revolution-insurgency-gilet-jaunes-extinction-rebellion\">recognisable leadership groups</a>, are breaking new ground.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>My mother told us that things would change. And that we could be a part of that change</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThere are those here in this country who are asking: \u2018Where is the contemporary Martin Luther King?\u2019, \u2018Where is the new Malcolm X?\u2019, \u2018Where is the next Marcus Garvey?\u2019\u201d says Davis. \u201cAnd, of course, when they think about leaders, they think about black male charismatic leaders. But the more recent radical organising among young people, which has been a feminist kind of organising, has emphasised collective leadership.\u201d</p> \n<p>But isn\u2019t there a tension between Davis\u2019s ideals of collectivity and her own status? \u201cI can\u2019t take myself too seriously,\u201d she says. \u201cI say that over and over again. Because none of this would have happened if it were only up to me as an individual. It was the movement and the impact of the movement.\u201d</p> \n<p>Davis has tried to pull that movement into the mainstream before. She ran for office herself in 1980, as the vice-presidential candidate for the US Communist party. In a lecture in 2006, she despaired at the George W Bush administration, and now she can\u2019t even bring herself to say Trump\u2019s name, instead opting for \u201cthe current resident of the White House\u201d. Does she think US democracy at present has room for radical ideas about social change? \u201cI don\u2019t think it can happen,\u201d says Davis. \u201cNot with the leadership of the current political formations \u2013 not the Democrats, and certainly not the Republican party.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb5902c2ff8d9fc12d751f5b2044f65c4b6fe689\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb5902c2ff8d9fc12d751f5b2044f65c4b6fe689/0_48_2783_1671/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Speaking at the Women\u2019s March in Washington in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Speaking at the Women\u2019s March in Washington in 2017.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noam Galai/WireImage</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But what about the Democrats taking a knee and wearing kente cloth in solidarity? Nancy Pelosi and other prominent Democrats wore the Ghanaian fabric, which was given to them by the Congressional Black Caucus, to show \u201csolidarity\u201d with African Americans, a crucial voter base that their presidential candidate, Joe Biden, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/22/black-americans-joe-biden-democratic-party-relationship\">is struggling to connect with</a>.<strong> </strong>\u201cThat was because they want to be on the right side of history,\u201d Davis says, dismissively. \u201cNot necessarily because they\u2019re going to do the right thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Davis sometimes tells a story at her lectures about how, as a young child in Birmingham, she asked her mother why she couldn\u2019t go to the segregated amusement park or libraries. Her mother, who was an activist before her, explained how segregation worked, but didn\u2019t leave it there. \u201cShe continually told us that things would change,\u201d says Davis. \u201cAnd that they would change, and that we could be a part of that change. So I learned as a child to live under racial segregation, but at the same time simultaneously, to live in an imagined new world and to recognise that things would not always be as they were.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cMy mother always said to us: \u2018This is not the way things are supposed to be, this is not the way the world is supposed to be.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 July 2020 to clarify that four girls were killed outright by the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist church.</p>"
