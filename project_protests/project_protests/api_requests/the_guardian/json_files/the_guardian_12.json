     "body": "<p>The lawyer of a man who was detained as a Metropolitan police officer briefly applied pressure with his knee to his neck area has demanded an official apology for his client.</p> \n<p>Timur Rustem said the case of Marcus Coutain \u201cmirrors almost identically what happened to George Floyd\u201d in the US, and the Crown Prosecution Service should review the case, drop charges against Coutain and offer a formal apology.</p> \n<p>Coutain, 48, who was filmed pleading with officers to \u201cget off my neck\u201d as he was handcuffed on the pavement in Islington, north London, on Thursday evening, appeared at Highbury Corner magistrates court on Saturday charged with possessing a knife in public, to which he indicated a plea of not guilty.</p> \n<p>He was granted technical bail as the case was sent to Snaresbrook crown court on 17 August. Rustem told the court his client had initially been searched for drugs and had then been told he matched the description of \u201csomeone involved in an attack\u201d.</p> \n<p>He told the court Coutain had the knife for repairing his bicycle, adding: \u201cHe had a lawful reason to have that item on him.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rustem named officer David Herald in court and read his statement, which said: \u201cI considered I used proportionate, necessary and reasonable force.\u201d</p> \n<p>As Coutain appeared in the dock for the 15-minute hearing, protesters from Stand Up to Racism staged a demonstration against police brutality outside Islington police station.</p> \n<p>The police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct, is investigating the manner of the arrest on Thursday evening, which has resulted in one officer being suspended and another placed on restricted duties.</p> \n<p>Speaking outside court, Rustem said: \u201cEssentially Mr Coutain was stopped and searched for matters for which he has not been charged. It is the use of what I would regard as excessive force, a knee being placed on his neck \u2026 references which mirror exactly what happened to George Floyd in America.</p> \n<p>\u201cA man saying \u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019 and \u2018get your knee off my neck\u2019 while he was already handcuffed and while he was restrained by two police officers.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rustem said Coutain received injuries to his wrists and neck that were \u201cfortunately minimal\u201d. He said: \u201cFortunately it didn\u2019t lead to the tragic consequences that we saw in America.\u201d</p> \n<p>The deputy Met commissioner, Sir Steve House, described footage of the arrest as \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d and said some of the techniques he saw were \u201cnot taught in police training\u201d and caused him \u201cgreat concern\u201d.</p> \n<p>Victor Olisa, a former Met chief superintendent, said: \u201cAs a retired police officer it was very disturbing to watch that video and realise it occurred within the last couple of days. That technique is not one that is taught. It represents an excessive use of force and has real risks about it. In this case it is key to disentangle police actions, the court hearing and the IOPC investigation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Referring also to the often automatic handcuffing of black males during searches, he added: \u201cI genuinely do fear these types of police practice are going to inflame community tensions.\u201d</p>"

It would have replaced the police department with a department of community safety and violence prevention that backers said would take a more \u201cholistic\u201d community approach. That approach was not fully defined.</p> <p>The proposal would have allowed for some armed police officers. It called for a division of licensed peace officers, who would have answered to the new department\u2019s director.</p> <p>\u201cThe council says \u2018Trust us. We\u2019ll figure it out after this is approved. Trust us.\u2019 Well, I don\u2019t, and we shouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Barry Clegg, chairman of the charter commission. \u201cCharter change is too important.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">What does 'defund the police' mean?

That is because the city council was required only to consult the commission and was not bound by their action.</p> <p>But the lack of a final decision means the proposal will not clear deadlines to make the ballot this November.</p> <p>Mel Reeves, a community activist, said he was not surprised, calling the decision a delay tactic.</p> <p>\u201cWe talk about living in a democracy, but if you really want to be democratic, sometimes it\u2019s damn near impossible. If people really want to do something, there are all kinds of mechanisms to keep them from doing it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, told the Associated Press that he opposes eliminating the police department.</p> <p>\u201cWe should not go down the route of simply abolishing the police department,\u201d Frey said on Tuesday. \u201cWhat we need to see within this department, and within many departments throughout the country, is a full-on culture shift.\u201d</p>"

I\u2019m expecting everyone to be taking knees before at least the first game of the season.\u201d</p> <p>Carter and company will not experience any opposition from the FA.

And the athletes\u2019 voice in this matters.\u201d</p> <p>Asante would endorse a blanket mandate to take a knee. \u201cA collective decision kind of takes the pressure away from the players,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big issue and one that has to be approached collectively.

An opportunity.</p> \n<p>Ross told of her boyfriend\u2019s brush with death from an overdose just weeks before he drew his last breath under Chauvin\u2019s knee in May last year. He took a pill she didn\u2019t recognise. \u201cHis stomach really hurt,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was doubled over in pain.\u201d</p> \n<p>Ross said she noticed a white substance around Floyd\u2019s mouth and got him to hospital, where he stayed for several days after apparently overdosing. It wasn\u2019t the first time.</p> \n<p>Chauvin\u2019s lawyer, Eric Nelson, drew attention to the similarity between Ross\u2019s description and the police account of Floyd\u2019s condition as they arrested him: a man complaining that his stomach hurt and with white foam around his mouth.</p> \n<p>Nelson\u2019s intent was to undercut <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/02/derek-chauvin-murder-trial-george-floyd-knee-neck-deadly-force\">the prosecution claim</a> that Chauvin killed Floyd by keeping his knee on his neck for more than nine minutes as Floyd lay on the ground.</p> \n<p>The defence has made a simple calculation. Sow doubt in just one juror about the cause of death \u2013 after all the official autopsy showed Floyd had a mix of drugs in his system \u2013 and Chauvin could walk free.</p> \n<p>But if the defence claim is that Floyd was evidently overdosing, or at least under the influence of drugs, why did Chauvin and his fellow officers not act on that at the time?</p> \n<p>From video shown in court, it\u2019s clear Floyd was in distress even before Chauvin put his knee on his neck. He was rambling and confused when officers arrived at the scene. The cashier who sold Floyd cigarettes shortly before his arrest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/31/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-minneapolis-store-clerk\">told the trial</a> he was evidently high, although friendly and not threatening.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbe87d1e96c0381795205870e465edc0a0ff8643\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbe87d1e96c0381795205870e465edc0a0ff8643/0_364_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A portrait of George Floyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A portrait of George Floyd hangs on fortifications at the Hennepin county government center, where Derek Chauvin is on trial.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nikolas Liepins/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Even if the police did not immediately recognise that Floyd was under the influence of drugs or at risk of overdosing, it is clear he was having some kind of crisis, perhaps with his mental health.</p> \n<p>Chauvin and his fellow officers heard Floyd repeatedly cry out about stomach pain and saw foam around his mouth. Yet his cries for help were dismissed. There appeared to be an indifference to his welfare. Chauvin told his supervisor only that Floyd was \u201cgoing crazy\u201d.</p> \n<p>Why did the police not recognise that the man in their custody was in crisis? Was it because the officers did not want to see? Or because they weren\u2019t trained to? Either way, those few minutes might have had a far less tragic outcome had they treated Floyd as a medical emergency.</p> \n<p>The paramedic who treated Floyd said that when he arrived, none of the police officers was offering the dying man any kind of first aid, even though he wasn\u2019t breathing. Throughout, Floyd remained only a suspect who had to be subdued.</p> \n<p>One reform demanded by protesters in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death is for a chunk of police budgets to be spent on putting social workers alongside officers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"35e9e2e8-f592-44c8-8431-ed08c4475b1c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ltu1LFLMAjM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The video recordings show that before Chauvin and his fellow officers tried to force Floyd into a squad car, he was handcuffed and sitting against a wall. He was not a threat to anyone and his arrest was not a matter of urgency. That was the moment when a social worker could have been consulted or asked to the scene, if such a policy had existed. Almost certainly the outcome would have been different.</p> \n<p>Other police departments have learned the value of social workers and mental health experts in dealing with drug crises. One of the pioneers has been the city of Huntington in West Virginia, a state ravaged by the opioid epidemic which for many years had the highest overdose rate in the country.</p> \n<p>Among other things, the presence of a social worker as police dealt with people overdosing or having some other form of drug emergency helped officers see people addicted to opioids in a different light.</p> \n<p>A former county police chief in Huntington told me the presence of social workers had transformed his thinking and that of many of his officers, who previously could not see the point of rescuing someone from an overdose only to see them do it again.</p> \n<p>The former chief likened it to the revelation brought about earlier in his career by training in why some women remain in abusive relationships even after police are repeatedly called.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/12/american-overdose-chris-mcgreal-review-heartland-sarah-smarsh-review\">American Overdose by Chris McGreal; Heartland by Sarah Smarsh \u2013 review</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There is enough that is worrying about Floyd\u2019s state of mind and health on video footage played in court for Chauvin and the other officers to have sought medical help. Instead there seemed to be just a determination to make an arrest \u2013 even though Chauvin could just have written Floyd a ticket for using a counterfeit $20 bill.</p> \n<p>But then perhaps, like a lot of other officers who encounter drug users in crisis, Floyd was seen as an \u201caddict\u201d to blame for his own condition.</p> \n<p>Ross told a different story of Floyd sucked into the trap of opioids by sports injuries, and prescribed oxycodone for pain. The medicine included the powerful narcotic OxyContin, which did so much to drive the opioid epidemic. Over two decades its maker, Purdue Pharma, unleashed mass prescribing of painkillers on a scale not seen in any other country.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe got addicted and we both tried to break that addiction many times,\u201d Ross said.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, Floyd failed to make that break, and was condemned for it.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>Chris McGreal is the author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/american-overdose-the-opioid-tragedy-in-three-acts/9781610398619\">American Overdose, the Opioid Tragedy in Three Acts</a></em></p></li> \n</ul>"

A lot of the time, teachers do not understand why it is negative to identify somebody as a slave,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cTeachers need to be trained to understand the impact that has on young people and why it is important to make sure that slavery is not the only narrative being told.\u201d</p> <p>The Labour MP Catherine McKinnell, the chair of parliament\u2019s petitions committee, which has conducted hearings on <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/work/739/black-history-and-cultural-diversity-in-the-curriculum/\">black history and cultural diversity in the national curriculum,</a> said: \u201cOne of the messages that came across clearly was that because teaching black history is not mandatory and merely a choice, it creates the impression that it is less important than other aspects of our history.\u201d</p> <p>Among those who gave evidence to MPs were the university students <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/1159/html/\">Esmie Jikiemi-Pearson and Nell Bevan</a>, whose <a href=\"https://impactofomission.squarespace.com/survey\">survey of 56,000 current and former pupils and teachers</a> found significant gaps in the British history syllabus.</p> <p>More than 86% of respondents said they learned about the Tudors, while 72% were taught about the Battle of Hastings and the Great Fire of London. But just under 37% learned about the transatlantic slave trade, less than 10% about the role of slavery in the British Industrial Revolution and less than 8% about the British colonisation of Africa.</p> <p>Jikiemi-Pearson, who studied history A-level, said: \u201cNo link was made between the long-lasting effects of colonialism and why some countries are still really struggling to find their feet again. It emphasised the divide between me and my white peers,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In contrast to England, the devolved Welsh government announced last week that learning about the contributions of black, Asian and minority ethnic communities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/mar/19/black-history-lessons-mandatory-welsh-schools-bame\">would be mandatory under a new curriculum</a> to be introduced next year. </p> <p>The Scottish government has committed to a review of its curriculum after the Black Lives Matter protests last summer. John Swinney, the deputy first minister and cabinet secretary for education and skills, said: \u201cThe challenge was put to us: \u2018Do you think you\u2019re doing enough in the Scottish curriculum to address the nation\u2019s relationship with slavery? I felt it was important that we confronted that and addressed it.\u201d</p> <p>Claire Alexander, a professor of sociology at the University of Manchester, said while efforts to diversify the curriculum dated back more than 50 years in the UK, there was now unprecedented recognition that change was required.</p> <p>Alexander, who set up the <a href=\"https://www.ourmigrationstory.org.uk/\">Our Migration Story</a> website in response to demand from pupils for more diverse histories, added: \u201cWhat we have found in all the schools we work with \u2013 in Cardiff, Leicester, Sheffield, London and Manchester \u2013 is that taking a different approach to history can engage all young people, no matter what their background is. It does provide a sense of shared belonging and understanding.\u201d</p> <p>In collaboration with the Black Curriculum, the Manchester Gorton MP, Afzal Khan, announced a diverse curriculum charter for schools in his constituency.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"587dead567351ddef0ed5cd7424cca2604e086e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/587dead567351ddef0ed5cd7424cca2604e086e7/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration incudes: protesters outside Cardiff Bay police station in January; official portrait of Afzal Khan MP.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration incudes: protesters outside Cardiff Bay police station in January; official portrait of Afzal Khan MP.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Guardian Design/\u270eRichard Townshend/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Khan said he was compelled to act after the murder of George Floyd in the US, the eruption of global BLM protests, and the disproportionate Covid-19 mortality rate in BAME communities, which had shown that racism was still affecting many people in the UK.</p> <p>Khan, who is of Pakistani heritage, said he hoped all schools across Greater Manchester would sign up to the charter. \u201cThe current curriculum is no longer fit for purpose,\u201d he added. \u201cIt no longer truly reflects the makeup of British society today.\u201d</p> <p>The contributions of the Indian continent and its people to world conflicts as well as Muslim innovations in science and art are just two examples of history that often get overlooked, he added.</p> <p>Sam Offord, a headteacher who signed up to Khan\u2019s charter, said her school, Birchfields primary in the Fallowfield area of Manchester, where the vast majority of pupils are from minority ethnic backgrounds, had already been working on diversifying its curriculum in light of the new Ofsted framework.</p> <p>Offord, the north-west regional secretary of the National Association of Headteachers, urged others to sign up to the charter. \u201cI began to realise, that even though I thought we had been addressing diversity in our curriculum, we really weren\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Another initiative is being led by <a href=\"https://www.thinkingblack.co.uk/\">Thinking Black</a>, a volunteer-run student organisation founded in 2017 at the University of Oxford, which works with school pupils to help \u201cfacilitate critical black thoughts among young people\u201d.</p> <p>Hope Oloye, a 24-year-old PhD student, founded the organisation to incorporate the thoughts and contributions of black people in the curriculum.</p> <p>\u201cA massive goal of ours is to recentre the contributions of black people within the curriculum,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause if you don\u2019t see yourself in any part of your curriculum, how can you feel passionate towards it or personally tied to it?\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"578985499456350c33aa903d9df398af20704e6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/578985499456350c33aa903d9df398af20704e6c/0_165_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thinking Black celebration day at Pembroke College, Oxford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thinking Black celebration day at Pembroke College, Oxford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hope Oloye/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since then, Thinking Black has worked with 215 black students from across the country aged 16 and 17, and has trained 156 to facilitate the programme.

Ask him about the US, and a mid-Atlantic lilt comes into play; quiz him on his time in the UK, and he sounds more like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/skepta\" title=\"\">Skepta</a> than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/may/25/artsfeatures\" title=\"\">King Sunny Ade</a>. But when he talks about his beloved Nigeria, the rich tones of the west African country are exposed, and it\u2019s this that has made him arguably the continent\u2019s most sought-after musical export. \u201cI don\u2019t really speak one language and I don\u2019t only talk one way. That shows in the music,\u201d he says, referring to the fact that he sings in a mix of Yoruba, Igbo and pidgin English. Is that to make a political point? \u201cIt\u2019s not a statement \u2013 it\u2019s just me being who I am.\u201d And who is that exactly?

After a couple of false starts, his sister, who has been tasked with ensuring the interview takes place, answers the phone. As the handset is passed around, I get a tour of the living room in his Lagos home. It looks a bit like the <a href=\"https://a-clockwork-orange.fandom.com/wiki/Korova_Milkbar\" title=\"\">Korova Milkbar</a> from A Clockwork Orange, all geometric shapes and bursts of dazzling white. Then, after a few moments, the phone is put in front of Burna Boy, who says hello before picking up a PS4 joypad and carrying on a game of Grand Theft Auto. \u201cI love the helicopter, you know,\u201d he says, as I struggle to wrestle his attention from the on-screen destruction. It\u2019s hardly an encouraging start. I\u2019m told he hates it when journalists expect long, detailed answers if he feels a short, curt response is all that\u2019s needed. \u201cIf you ask a question, he\u2019s gonna answer it honestly, but it\u2019s not gonna be a very long answer,\u201d says a member of his team before we get started. In the end, however, it turns out he has quite a lot to say.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"53b2f684bbc5ef4947179cd55d02e4915a79a274\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53b2f684bbc5ef4947179cd55d02e4915a79a274/0_0_4000_6000/667.jpg\" alt=\"With his partner, British R&B star Stefflon Don.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With his partner, British R&amp;B star Stefflon Don.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The chaos caused by Covid-19 means that Burna Boy is conducting promotion for his forthcoming album, Twice As Tall, from his home.

That helped make his last record, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/26/burna-boy-african-giant-review\" title=\"\">African Giant</a>, a breakthrough in the US. He did it without compromise, and with a sound of his own he calls Afro-fusion \u2013 a mix of Afrobeats and other genres, including dancehall and hip-hop. Despite the punch and power of his beats, he\u2019s not bound by the parameters of rap \u2013 musically he\u2019s got just as much in common with Fela Kuti or Babatunde Olatunji as Drake or Migos.</p> <p>At the start of last year he was outraged that his name was too small on the poster for Coachella (\u201cI am an AFRICAN GIANT and will not be reduced to whatever that tiny writing means,\u201d he wrote on Instagram).

When asked how he chooses collaborators, Burna goes mystical: \u201cI don\u2019t pick the people I work with, my spirit does,\u201d he says. Stormzy and Dave have both collaborated with him (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/JpGKWUdRnXE\" title=\"\">Dave\u2019s track Location</a> was one of last summer\u2019s mainstays), while acts as varied as Lily Allen, Ed Sheeran, Jorja Smith and J Hus have also asked for the Burna treatment. He usually adds a softer, melodic chorus in his rap guest spots and brings Afro-fusion credibility to his pop collaborators.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The only way we can move forward is if we all know that Africa is our home and make sure our home is a place that is respected</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Burna Boy believes there\u2019s something deeper at work when it comes to his popularity in the UK. \u201cMost of the people from the UK, if not all the black people from the UK, and the people of colour \u2013 they all know where they\u2019re from,\u201d he says. \u201cThey know exactly where their roots are.\u201d This, he says, makes it easier for people to tune into his wavelength. It took longer for his music to find an audience in the US; this, he says, is a consequence of African Americans not having the same close connection with Africa. \u201cUnfortunately, the brothers in the US have been stripped of their whole knowledge of self,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it\u2019s a bit harder for them, you know?\u201d When he collaborated with the US rappers YG and Future, he said he was \u201cbringing my brothers home\u201d.</p> <p>There\u2019s a whole generation of African \u2013 and often Nigerian \u2013 artists who, along with Burna Boy, have taken the Afrobeats sound global. Davido, Wizkid, Olamide, Naira Marley, Tiwa Savage and Zlatan \u2013 all have had success in Europe or the US, but Burna Boy is a slightly different proposition. His aesthetic borrows from hip-hop\u2019s sartorial playbook: thick gold chains adorn his neck, he has a vast collection of rings, and when he smiles he often reveals gold- and jewel-encrusted teeth grills. Tattoos cover most of his upper body, arms and hands. But even here, Africa (and specifically Nigeria) is everywhere. His tattoos include a brick wall with the names of family members written on it, and there\u2019s a portrait of Fela Kuti on his left forearm. The title of his first album, Leaving An Impact For Eternity, has also been inked, and he has the phrase \u201cOmo Naija\u201d \u2013 child of Nigeria \u2013 above the country\u2019s coat of arms on his shoulder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0439b49157176ef0af1e2dde93d679ae95a9da13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0439b49157176ef0af1e2dde93d679ae95a9da13/0_0_3829_3829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burna Boy photographed in Lagos earlier this month wearing a red suit and standing by a red open-top car\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burna Boy has a fleet of cars including a G-Wagon, a Bentley and a Ferrari 458.

When I ask if he supports Black Lives Matter he says: \u201cI\u2019m more of an NFAC kind of guy,\u201d referring to the Not Fucking Around Coalition, the armed African-American group made up of ex-military personnel that has been compared to the Black Panthers. While most stars might dance around a subject like this, and offer a general comment about anti-racism, Burna is happy to jump in with both feet and back a group whose leader has advocated for the state of Texas becoming an independent country for African-Americans. This isn\u2019t safe ground for pop stars, but Burna clearly doesn\u2019t see himself as just that \u2013 his goals are much bigger. He\u2019s said previously that his aim is \u201cthe eventual unity of Africa\u201d, and to understand his philosophy you need to go back to his childhood.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Born Damini Ebunoluwa Ogulu on 2 July 1991 in the oil city of Port Harcourt in south-east Nigeria, Burna Boy says he knew he was going to be a star from the age of two. As a toddler, he would dance and sing when his parents took him to restaurants. When he was a little older, he fell in love with US rappers such as Naughty By Nature, DMX, Big Pun and Busta Rhymes via his uncle, while his father introduced him to the dancehall of Buju Banton. He describes his upbringing as being \u201cnot too rich, not poor\u201d but it\u2019s fair to say it was comfortable. His father worked in construction, while his mother was a translator for the West African Chambers of Commerce; she is fluent in French, Italian and German. Meanwhile, his maternal grandfather managed Fela Kuti\u2019s career. What was a typical weekend like in the Burna Boy household when he was growing up? \u201cMy grandfather playing Afrobeat, usually Fela, my dad working on the barbecue, and my mum just causing a scene,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd me trying to find a corner to smoke some weed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75cf7102a8b45a5af92424808dbddc026ba0ad15\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75cf7102a8b45a5af92424808dbddc026ba0ad15/0_0_3865_4261/907.jpg\" alt=\"A black-and-white photograph of Burna Boy wearing a suit but no shirt\" width=\"907\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Styling: Ronami Ogulu.

In the early 2010s he came to London to continue his education, but when I ask him whether it was university or college, he won\u2019t engage: \u201cAll of that,\u201d he says, dismissively. In the end, he never attended a class, and instead spent his time with friends in Brixton. Like his hero Fela Kuti, he came to the UK for an academic education and got one in music instead, taking back some of the grime and slang he\u2019d heard in south London to Lagos. It was then that he began to make his own music, which at that point was closer to the US R&amp;B he used to watch on MTV. \u201cOnly later, when I started finding myself and understanding who I am, did I start appreciating African music and everything my grandad had been trying to put into my hands since I was a kid,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He clearly shares his grandfather\u2019s affection for Fela, who is an influence not just musically but also for his philosophy. He\u2019s shot videos at Fela\u2019s New Afrika Shrine, the Lagos venue run by Fela\u2019s son Femi Kuti. Why is there such a pull? \u201cBecause he made the music he wanted to,\u201d he explains, adding that Fela\u2019s defiance of Nigeria\u2019s military dictatorship makes him his \u201csuperhero \u2013 even though I guarantee you at that time people didn\u2019t understand, and they were probably dissing him because they didn\u2019t get it. I\u2019m from a very hypocritical society, where the truth is not applauded.\u201d</p> <p>He tackles some of those contradictions in his music. On African Giant, the song Dangote references Nigerian industrialist Aliko Dangote, one of the world\u2019s richest men whose name can be seen plastered on the side of trucks that are a ubiquitous presence on the country\u2019s roads. On Twice As Tall\u2019s lead single, Wonderful, he says he hustles \u201clike Adebayo Ogunlesi\u201d, the Nigerian investment banker who is most famous for buying Gatwick and London City airports. He\u2019s not really critical of these figures; they\u2019re shorthand for wealth and excess in the same way that Donald Trump was a go-to reference for rappers in the 90s. He\u2019s certainly not blaming them for the huge inequality in his home country. \u201cThe only people who I focus on, and who have blame for whatever is happening now, is us \u2013 the youth,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause we take what we get sitting down. Freedom is not something that is given.\u201d Can his self-styled \u201cprotest music\u201d cut through the hypocrisy? \u201cWe\u2019re not ready yet,\u201d he says of his homeland. \u201cThat\u2019s how our minds have been suppressed, this is a deep-rooted issue.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dbbf3d605b2c7df945d2d68a910271bd6015790\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dbbf3d605b2c7df945d2d68a910271bd6015790/0_0_2964_1973/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Burna Boy performs at Wembley with Dave last year\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burna Boy performs at Wembley with Dave last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Okpako/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In past interviews, Burna Boy regularly raises the idea of pan-Africanism: that unity on the continent is the way for it to thrive. The movement grew up at the end of the colonial era, and saw a collective push to oppose apartheid and resist imperialism. It\u2019s hardly a new concept, but it\u2019s rare to hear it discussed by a pop star, so I\u2019m intrigued to find out where he pulls his influences from: is it Fela, Patrice Lumumba, the elected leader of the Democratic Republic of the Congo who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jan/17/patrice-lumumba-50th-anniversary-assassination\" title=\"\">murdered in 1961</a> with help from the Belgian government, or his parents?</p> <p>There\u2019s a pause, and then he answers. \u201cMuammar Gaddafi,\u201d he says, leaning into the camera. Wait, what? Seriously? What about the global exportation of terrorism, the four-decade brutal reign in which dissent was squashed, often violently. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Burna shoots back. \u201cBecause that was the agenda that was pushed, and that was the news that was pushed in your face?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Africa has the most visibly corrupt leaders. Africa is the way it is today because of the leaders and the greed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Well, he did ultimately admit responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing \u2013 and it\u2019s a fact that he suppressed his opponents, and killed foreign-based dissidents. It\u2019s a tough position to argue, I say. \u201cIt\u2019s not a tough one, it\u2019s a realistic one,\u201d Burna says<strong>,</strong> defiantly. His logic goes that Gaddafi should be applauded for his ambitions to start the African Monetary Fund in order to counter the power of the Eurocentric IMF, and for his socialist policies in Libya. However flawed, his ideas were truly pan-African, he argues.</p> <p>This is a very different Burna Boy from the taciturn, reluctant interviewee I\u2019d been warned about. As he talks about pan-Africanism, he leans closer and closer to the phone, turning his head to hear the questions. The joypad is long gone, the helicopter has probably crashed into a building. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to make justifications for anything, I\u2019m just trying to tell you the reality,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the reality is that Africa has the most visibly corrupt leaders. The reason that Africa is the way it is today is because of the leaders and the greed. Who elected those leaders? Was it not the citizens? Is that not democracy?\u201d</p> <p>So what\u2019s the alternative? He\u2019s not sure, but he\u2019s got a question for me. \u201cHave you seen Libya today?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe evidence [that the situation is no better] is there for the world to see. The only thing is, it does not pay the powers that be to push the truth in your face \u2013 it pays to push their agendas.\u201d</p> <p>At this point, the PR interjects to move the conversation on. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"13c42b5910d295113da4765465e2a8fb20034fcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13c42b5910d295113da4765465e2a8fb20034fcb/0_0_3329_3325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A black-and-white portrait of Burna Boy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Styling: Ronami Ogulu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Tayo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We return to Burna\u2019s youth when, as a teen, he would steal his dad\u2019s car, a Mitsubishi Galant, and drive around Port Harcourt with his friends. A decade later, he has moved up in the world. He sings about his G-Wagon (a Mercedes-Benz G-Class) and his Bentley on the song Ye. I\u2019m curious to know how he negotiates Lagos\u2019s notorious traffic in a Bentley, but it turns out he doesn\u2019t have to: \u201cI drive a Ferrari 458 in Lagos, so the Bentley is not a problem,\u201d he says, going into a detailed run-through of his fleet of cars and their specific uses. \u201cSo certain places I need to go with the G-Wagon, because the roads are mad. Then on Sundays, if I want to go to the boat, it\u2019s the Rolls-Royce. On a Friday, it\u2019s going to be the Ferrari because I\u2019ll be going to someone\u2019s house. Then if it\u2019s like a business thing, it\u2019s the Range Rover. You know, there are different times for different cars.\u201d</p> <p>Different cars for different situations: it could be a metaphor for how Burna Boy has got to where he is today. Why choose one genre when you can create your own and make the world of music dance to your tune? </p> <p>\u2022 Twice As Tall is out on 14 August.</p>"

In the days following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sunrise activists woke up key Republican senators including McConnell and Lindsey Graham, demanding that they delay the vote on Trump\u2019s supreme court nominee until a new president is sworn in.</p> <p>\u201cEven though we can\u2019t vote, we can show up on the streets and wake up politicians. It\u2019s our future on the line not theirs,\u201d said 17-year-old Abby DiNardo, a senior from Delaware county. The high school senior recently coordinated a Wide Awake action outside the home of the Republican senator Pat Toomey, a former Wall Street banker who has repeatedly voted against climate action measures.</p> <p>The Sunrise Movement was founded by a small group of disparate young activists in 2017 and initially focussed on helping elect proponents of clean energy in the 2018 midterms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46634d48e4d6746ea64328c47f2ca029b300b373\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46634d48e4d6746ea64328c47f2ca029b300b373/0_0_3840_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We can show up on the streets and wake up politicians.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We can show up on the streets and wake up politicians.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sunrise Movement</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It has since evolved into an influential youth-led political movement, with more than 400 hubs nationwide that use rallies, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/11/13/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-sunrise-activists-nancy-pelosi/\">sit-ins</a> and old-fashioned voter outreach to help elect local, state and national candidates who back key progressive issues such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/11/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ed-markey\">Green New Deal</a> and police and immigration reform.</p> <p>Sunrise members made about 200,000 calls to help Senator Ed Markey, a leading Green New Deal sponsor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/03/ed-markey-primary-victory-climate-crisis\">win the Massachusetts Democratic primary election</a> against Joe Kennedy who was backed by the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi.</p> <p>On Thursday <strong> </strong>middle school students gathered outside the Philadelphia constitution centre during Joe Biden\u2019s ABC town hall to demanded a better, bolder climate action plan from the Democratic presidential candidate.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I do my part, I hope others will be empowered to fight for future generations too</p> <footer> <cite>Maddy King</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cZero emissions by 2050 isn\u2019t fast enough,\u201d said Maddy King, 13. \u201cClimate change is already happening, it\u2019s not a theory.

A number of journalists not involved with BComs have also signed up, including the BBC presenter Gabby Logan and TalkSport host Laura Woods.</p> <p>\u201cThese last few weeks have brought an exhausting and overwhelming sense of frustration, grief and sadness, following the violent deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Aubrey. Although these incidents occurred in the USA, the systemic racism that enables tragedies like this to occur also exists in the UK,\u201d reads the letter.</p> <p>\u201cThe role of the sports media is highly influential in shaping our views, and a sports media that lacks diversity is not fit for purpose. We believe now is the time to hold the industry to account to ensure that the sector is truly inclusive from top to bottom.\u201d</p> <p>Included in the seven-point plan is a call for all media outlets to establish external task forces dedicated to \u201creviewing, monitoring and challenging\u201d their diversity aims, run compulsory unconscious and conscious bias training programmes for senior management using black facilitators, and ensure all BAME staff, including long-standing freelancers, are able to develop and enhance their career at their respective workplaces. </p> <p>The numbers around the lack of diversity in the UK sports media are stark, as seen in BComs\u2019 most up-to-date statistics, which are based on journalists who covered major sporting events in 2018, namely the World Cup, Winter Olympics and Paralympics, Wimbledon, the Commonwealth Games and the inaugural multi-sport European Championships, for the major national newspaper titles and broadcasting networks. Of the 338 who did, only 32 (9.4%) came from a BAME background. Of those 32, only five did not have an association with professional sport, while no BAME women filled any of the 109 newspaper roles and only one black writer, of either gender, attended the World Cup.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/20/leon-mann-we-need-people-in-power-to-show-they-care-about-diversity\">Leon Mann: \u2018We need people in power to show they care about diversity\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a general acceptance within the industry that things need to change but that has been the case for some time yet little progress is ever made.

     "body": "<p>Tony Todd chuckles heartily. \u201cWhy in the fuck would I go to a mirror, with me in the mirror \u2013 the actor who played the role \u2013 and call out my own damn name five times?\u201d I have just asked the dumb \u2013 but obligatory \u2013 question of whether he has ever dared utter <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeLZMhkFTuU\">Candyman</a>\u2019s fatal invocation. Todd played Daniel Robitaille, AKA the Candyman, the hook-handed, bee-spouting yet swoonsome spectre from the 1992 horror classic. \u201cI have never waded in that water. I don\u2019t even listen to people when they come to me and say that. I cut them off. They try it; they want to me stop them or something.\u201d</p> <p>Todd is probably getting quite a bit of this right now. Candyman was already enjoying a critical revival in the last few years as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> and other social movements gathered headway; despite, or perhaps because of, its white director (the Englishman Bernard Rose), it was able to smuggle in a theme that was exceptional for a 90s horror film: the psychic cost of centuries of oppression of African Americans. Now, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> protests and with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/jordan-peele\">Jordan Peele</a>-produced sequel imminent, interest in this unusually sensitive piece of Hollywood product is white-hot.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlwzuZ9kOQU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tlwzuZ9kOQU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The new film \u2013 now delayed until next year \u2013 revolves around the gentrification in Chicago of the area where the deprived <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabrini%E2%80%93Green_Homes\">Cabrini-Green housing project</a> depicted in the original was torn down. When gentrifying its own film properties, Hollywood normally has similar levels of respect for former residents. Remarkably, though, Todd is returning in his most celebrated role \u2013 though he still seemed unsure of this as late as three months before shooting began in August last year. It\u2019s a testament to his brilliant performance first time round, the lordly elegance he brought to what could have been just another movie bogeyman.</p> <p>He can only drop a few tantalising titbits about the new version. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it and it\u2019s brilliant.

Out in the Philippines, where Ferdinand Marcos had been freshly deposed, Dye had the troupe digging their own bivouacs and going out on night raids. Todd, who played a sergeant, says he had it easy: \u201cI had intel about what time a simulated attack was gonna occur. I also had a choice of MREs [meals ready to eat]; some of them were absolutely dreadful.\u201d Dye would also give his \u201cofficers\u201d privileged nips from the supply of airport bottles of Jack Daniel\u2019s he kept stowed away.</p> <p>The process resulted in the rawness, tension and camaraderie Platoon still radiates today. Todd believes, like others on the cast, that Stone hired him for a certain authenticity. \u201cThe last thing he wanted was anybody that looked like an actor. He wanted real faces. So it helped that I came from the theatre and I came from poverty.\u201d The director had seen him in a one-man version of Dalton Trumbo\u2019s antiwar novel Johnny Got His Gun at a Hell\u2019s Kitchen theatre, where Todd was also working the bar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffc30871b06975d7f2937189bc1c34164fdf908b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffc30871b06975d7f2937189bc1c34164fdf908b/204_56_2842_1706/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I saw grown men cry\u2019 \u2026 the cast of Platoon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I saw grown men cry\u2019 \u2026 the cast of Platoon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Todd credits his aunt, Clara Elliston, who took custody of him when he was three, for setting him on an artistic course. \u201cMy mother was going through some issues. So the family intervened. And, you know, my mother has no memory of it to this day, and I respect her as the woman who birthed me. But, you know, I\u2019m also glad that my aunt intervened and put me on the right path,\u201d he says. He moved from Washington DC to Hartford, Connecticut, where Elliston \u2013 who couldn\u2019t have children \u2013 worked as a maid. \u201cShe would bring me to some of her places, and I would stay in the library while she cleaned the house. I loved books at an early age, so I was content.\u201d</p> <p>Elliston enrolled him on summer courses and later encouraged his interest in the theatre, occasionally supporting him financially as a young actor in New York. Todd has since reconciled with his mother \u2013 now a born-again Christian pastor \u2013 but says coming to terms with his turbulent infant years was what drove him later: \u201cThat all fuels me as an actor. Because it is part of my DNA, part of my pain, my pleasure, my intellectual zone, my comfort and my discomfort.\u201d This fertile ground is what the New England theatre schools who gave him scholarships obviously saw; though his 6ft 5in frame and remarkable face \u2013 alternately graceful or shark-like \u2013 can\u2019t have hurt his chances.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/01/brothers-in-arms-review-platoon-oliver-stone\">Brothers in Arms review \u2013 Platoon's veterans hold their audience hostage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His horror-icon status has meant that Hollywood has readily slotted him into villainous or at least sinister roles; his <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0865302/\">humongous filmography</a> also includes Final Destination, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and Hatchet. (Sometimes though, Todd was on the receiving end, as in a spectacular <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y12_cVX2exw\">Elton John-related demise in The Rock</a> in which he is blown out of a window by Nicolas Cage who sneers: \u201cYou\u2019re the Rocketman!\u201d) But he is convinced that depictions of evil in genre films such as Candyman must be grounded in reality to be meaningful; he is certain the new version, in the context of Black Lives Matter, cannot fail to strike a chord.</p> <p>In terms of stemming real-life horror, he supports police reform \u2013 though not the defunding of police. (Two of his uncles were New York homicide detectives.) Direct action for Todd doesn\u2019t just have to happen on the streets: he engages in social work, which has included gang outreach work on the back of his Candyman fame and acting seminars for underprivileged kids. This pay-it-forward strain will, he says, be a major theme in his autobiography, another of his lockdown projects. \u201cI\u2019m an African American man who wasn\u2019t supposed to make it. And somehow I beat the system. I want to be an inspiration. Cos somewhere out there is a little boy who\u2019s confused, just like I was. And I want to say: you can do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Brothers in Arms: The Making of Platoon is out on DVD and digital download on 5 October. Candyman is out next year.</p>"

It\u2019s a start.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNAvkbwzeTs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LNAvkbwzeTs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>After three weeks of protests, \u201cnow it\u2019s time to put our money where our mouth is\u2026just as soon as we take the slave owners off the money\u201d, said Colbert, who noted that the moment of economic and social turmoil offered America a \u201ctremendous opportunity, but to do what?\u201d There\u2019s incremental reform, such as a bill introduced by House Democrats to ban police chokeholds. And there\u2019s more radical reform, such as the popular call to \u201cdefund the police\u201d, meaning to divert funding poured into police departments to other community resources such as mental health services, social services and education.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cRight now, because those other services have been under-funded for years, all of that eventually falls to the police,\u201d Colbert explained. \u201cAnd that\u2019s way too many things for them to be doing. It\u2019s like in the Middle Ages: it wasn\u2019t a good idea that your barber was also your dentist and your surgeon. And saying \u2018defund the barber\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean no one\u2019s getting haircuts \u2014\u2013 although admittedly right now, no one\u2019s getting haircuts.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/09/trevor-noah-protests-black-lives-matter-late-night\">Trevor Noah on those doubting the protests: 'They\u2019re going to be eating their words'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating has dropped to 38%, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/08/politics/cnn-poll-trump-biden-chaotic-week/index.html\">latest CNN poll</a>, and the president is \u201cdesperate to turn things around\u201d, to the point where he\u2019s reportedly considered delivering a speech to the nation on race and unity. \u201cYes, they\u2019re <em>considering</em> it \u2013 a heroic <em>contemplation</em> of the <em>possibility </em>of leadership,\u201d said Colbert. \u201cIt reminds me of Dr King\u2019s immortal words: \u2018I\u2019m thinking about having a dream.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>While Trump contemplated, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden spoke up, delivering a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UK1Sskf7EE\">moving virtual eulogy for George Floyd</a> at a memorial service in Houston on Tuesday. \u201cYou see, President Trump? It\u2019s possible to bring people to tears at church without having to release pepper spray,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cAnd the Vice-President did the one thing that the President fears the most: Biden didn\u2019t mention the name Donald Trump once. Let\u2019s hope very soon, we can all do the same.\u201d</p> <h2>Trevor Noah</h2> <p>On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah parsed the differences between the response by congressional Democrats and Republicans to the Black Lives Matter protests across the nation. Earlier this week, Democrats led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi kneeled in honor of George Floyd wearing kente cloths, an indigenous Ghanaian fabric. \u201cI understand the symbolic gesture of kneeling to remember George Floyd. What I don\u2019t understand is needing to dress like extras from Coming to America 2,\u201d said Noah, adding the gesture \u201cfelt like they were trying too hard\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1270545450156908547\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today in No, Not Like That: Team Trump brags about getting 8% of the Black vote while the Democrats dress like extras from Coming to America 2. <a href=\"https://t.co/OQqYGOk4zA\">pic.twitter.com/OQqYGOk4zA</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1270545450156908547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 10, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cNow, to be fair, the Democrats weren\u2019t just kneeling and wearing kente cloth,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also unveiled police reform legislation that would make some pretty big changes,\u201d such as banning no-knock warrants in drug cases, which allowed police to enter into the home and kill Breonna Taylor in Louisville in April, and make chokeholds a civil rights violation. And it would make it easier to prosecute police who use excessive force, which is virtually impossible now. \u201cLike now, you need to catch them on video, then have a [District Attorney] that\u2019s willing to prosecute them, then have a jury that actually wants to hold cops accountable,\u201d Noah explained. \u201cThen, after all that, you still need to find the cops Horcrux and destroy it, otherwise they just get to go right back out on the force.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Trump doubled down on his backing of police, telling reporters: \u201cI say 99.9, but let\u2019s go with 99% of [cops] are great, great people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, 99% of all police are great people. And I guess it\u2019s just unlucky that protesters happen to keep meeting with the bad 1% over, and over, and over again,\u201d said Noah over recent images of police brutality against protesters.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that all cops are bad. But the problems with the police are much more widespread than Trump is acknowledging,\u201d he continued. \u201cBecause every single time \u2013 every single time \u2013 a police department gets audited, or investigated, the results that come back time and time again show deep rot and systemic issues often from the top. It\u2019s like turning on a black light in a hotel room \u2013 there\u2019s no way you\u2019re only going to find one stain.\u201d</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg7ASRLdsB0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tg7ASRLdsB0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel responded to reports that Trump has dismissed polls placing him behind Biden as false. \u201cIf you think he won\u2019t contest the election if he loses \u2013 he won\u2019t even accept the meaningless poll he\u2019s losing,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to drag him out of that White House by his heels.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt makes sense that Trump doesn\u2019t get it. He\u2019s like a lot of soft-brained 73-year-old men who watch nothing but Fox News,\u201d Kimmel continued, cutting to Tucker Carlson arguing on Fox News that America is not a racist country. \u201cRight, but didn\u2019t you want to build a wall to keep those immigrants out of \u2026 oh, nevermind. He\u2019s right! America\u2019s fine, we have no problems at all,\u201d Kimmel deadpanned. \u201cThose people marching in the streets? They\u2019re just getting exercise.\u201d</p> <p>Kimmel also touched on Trump\u2019s propagation of a conspiracy theory that Martin Gugino, the 75-year-old man in serious condition with a skull fracture after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/buffalo-officers-filmed-shoving-75-year-old-protester-charged-with-assault\">Buffalo police shoved him to the ground</a> during a protest last week, is an Antifa covert agent. \u201cJust to recap, the theory here is that a 75-year-old man was using his cell phone to scan police communication equipment in order to black it out,\u201d Kimmel explained. \u201cI think anyone who\u2019s tried to Zoom with their grandparents knows there\u2019s no possible way that\u2019s true. But our president? It takes a special kind of monster to see a peaceful 75-year-old man shoved to the ground by police so hard he bleeds from the ears and take the side of the concrete, but he does \u2013 our un-Founding Father.\u201d</p>"

     "standfirst": "<p>The Sussex police and crime commissioner on the Black Lives Matter protests and how the force is tackling domestic abuse during lockdown</p>",
     "body": "<p>\u201cThe mood of the officers I have spoken to is one of disgust, disbelief and disappointment that the actions of a handful of police officers on the other side of the world could potentially undo decades of progress in re-establishing public trust in policing,\u201d says Katy Bourne, the police and crime commissioner for Sussex.</p> <p>As the elected commissioner, Bourne, 55, is responsible for holding the chief constable of Sussex police to account, scrutinising the performance of the force and setting the county\u2019s \u00a3310m police and crime plan. Speaking after a weekend of Black Lives Matter protests across the UK, including more than <a href=\"https://www.theargus.co.uk/news/18501730.black-lives-matter-protests-brighton-sussex/\">1,000 protesters</a> who marched through Brighton city centre to express their outrage over the death of George Floyd, as well as other towns in Sussex, Bourne recognises the strength of feeling among the demonstrators.</p> <p>Sussex police officers knelt before protesters in a symbol of support as demonstrators reached Brighton police station in John Street. \u201cI completely understand why officers want to show their solidarity with those calling for more action to tackle racism and for their fellow police officers to be fair and reasonable in upholding and enforcing the law,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But she adds: \u201cWe all acknowledge that, however strong the relationship between police and public, there will always be more to do and PCCs are there to ensure that local, public concerns feed into local policing approaches.\u201d</p> <p>A major plank of Sussex police\u2019s public-facing role in recent months has been policing the lockdown. How has the force coped with coronavirus? \u201cThe biggest challenge for the police was always going to be coming out of lockdown as restrictions loosened,\u201d says Bourne. \u201cTen weeks of lockdown has been tough on everyone and it\u2019s not surprising people want to get out and enjoy the sunshine on our beautiful beaches,\u201d she says. \u201cThe job was always challenging because the police never had the powers to stop people visiting the beauty spots. So what we\u2019ve had is local councils pleading with people to stay away.\u201d</p> <p>Brighton &amp; Hove city council warned visitors to stay away after droves of sun-seekers descended on the seafront during the May bank holiday, sparking fears of a second outbreak. There were 16,947 fixed penalty notices issued across England (15,552) and Wales (1,395) between 27 March and 25 May, according to the <a href=\"https://www.npcc.police.uk/\">National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council</a>.</p> <p>Of those, <a href=\"https://news.npcc.police.uk/releases/statistical-update-on-number-of-lockdown-fines-given-by-police\">757 were issued in Sussex</a>, the fifth highest amount of forces in England. \u201cThe police were never there to hold up tape measures and enforce social distancing, the public has to take that responsibility. But where large groups gather they will be proactive,\u201d says Bourne. \u201cMore than 50% of those fines were issued to people coming from outside the county. Enforcement has been a last resort.\u201d</p> <p>But it has sometimes come at a personal cost to staff. Sussex police recorded a 39% rise in assaults against officers in April, compared to the same time last year. In all, 169 offences were recorded against frontline officers and staff in the county during the first four weeks of lockdown, including officers being punched, kicked, bitten, spat and coughed on and threats to infect the officers and their families with the virus.</p> <p>Bourne says: \u201cWe saw a spate of that [spitting] in Sussex and it was quite distressing.</p> <p>\u201cThe senior officers have worked very closely with the Crown Prosecution Service to fast-track cases where officers were spat on and Covid-19 was cited. At least one man got a prison sentence and rightly so \u2026 it\u2019s pretty despicable behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>Fortunately, she says, to her knowledge, none of the officers targeted got the virus as a result. \u201cThey had access to tests [to check that]. As far as the safety of officers goes we were very clear from the start that Sussex would have the adequate PPE and on a national level police forces worked together quite well to source their own PPE.\u201d</p> <p>While some offences such as burglaries and drug-related street crimes have decreased as a result of lockdown \u2013 latest figures show that police recorded crime <a href=\"https://news.npcc.police.uk/releases/sustained-falls-in-recorded-crime-reported-throughout-lockdown\">has fallen by 25%</a>, others are on the rise.<strong> </strong> Bourne, who is one of seven female PCCs and chair of the <a href=\"https://www.apccs.police.uk/\">Association of Police and Crime Commissioners</a>, says protecting the most vulnerable members of society during lockdown has been a priority. She is especially concerned about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/domestic-abuse-surge-coronavirus-lockdown-lasting-impact-mps\">increase in domestic abuse</a> during lockdown and last month attended the prime minister\u2019s virtual <a href=\"https://homeofficemedia.blog.gov.uk/2020/05/22/hidden-harms-summit-factsheet/#:~:text=The%20Prime%20Minister%20hosted%20a,impacted%20by%20the%20coronavirus%20lockdown.\">hidden harms summit</a> to discuss ways of tackling such crimes among others. </p> <p>She says Sussex police is already taking pre-emptive action. \u201cWe decided rather than wait until we come out of lockdown and find people have gone through the most unimaginable horrors behind closed doors, let\u2019s be proactive and reach out to them now.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a new team of 30 specially trained officers who deal solely with reports of domestic abuse that don\u2019t require an urgent or 999 response.\u201d</p> <p>The force is the first in the country to use new video-conferencing software that enables a potential victim to provide a safe number where police can send a disguised text. <a href=\"https://www.sussex.police.uk/news/sussex/news/force-news/sussex-police-maintain-focus-on-domestic-abuse/\">The message contains a link </a>that will take them to a virtual waiting room where an officer can see and talk to them. \u201cIt\u2019s always better to have a face-to-face conversation and lockdown has made this difficult,\u201d says Bourne. \u201cThe officer can do all their investigations through the discreet technology before explaining how to delete the link so there is no trace of it. It is a one-time text conversation and has been incredibly successful.\u201d</p> <p>Sussex police started using the platform a month ago and now use it for a third of their appointments. Police have also been using a new analytical dashboard system that allows them to overlay police reports with other data to get a richer picture of the most prolific offenders. Dedicated domestic abuse cars then visit potential perpetrators to warn them they are being monitored. Since January these teams have attended 2,903 domestic abuse crimes and incidents. \u201cThe idea is to de-escalate situations before they become high risk,\u201d says Bourne, who herself has been the victim of targeted abuse: she has been followed, filmed and harassed online since taking office in 2012. At the height of the abuse she feared for her own safety and was nearly driven out of her job.</p> <p>Matthew Taylor was given a suspended four-month jail sentence in October 2018 for breaching an earlier restraining order. There are live proceedings under way against three others linked to his case who have harassed or either Bourne or her colleagues. \u201cI didn\u2019t come into the job expecting to end up with so much first-hand experience [of harassment] but it has helped me to understand the trauma victims go through,\u201d says Bourne. \u201cWhat is really invidious about stalking is that it is premeditated, and it\u2019s very dangerous behaviour. It\u2019s been going on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/08/coronavirus-surge-stalking-victims-seeking-help-during-uk-lockdown\">during lockdown with more victims harassed online</a> and others have been stalked physically despite the measures.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat concerns me is that stalkers who were perhaps not that tech-savvy before will have had more time to turn to cyberbullying. Those furloughed will have 24 hours a day to obsess over their victims.\u201d</p> <p>Lockdown has seen a surge in stalking victims seeking help. Referrals to the <a href=\"https://veritas-justice.co.uk/\">Veritas Stalking Advocacy Service</a> in Sussex increased by 26% and the national stalking charity<a href=\"https://paladinservice.co.uk/\"> Paladin</a> has seen a 40% rise in requests for support.</p> <p>\u201cMore than 90% of domestic homicides feature an element of stalking, usually right at the outset,\u201d says Bourne. If we can stop that, then at the end of the day you are going to save lives.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Curriculum vitae</strong></h2> <p><strong>Age</strong>: 55.</p> <p><strong>Lives:</strong>&nbsp;Sussex.</p> <p><strong>Family:</strong>&nbsp;Married, two sons.</p> <p><strong>Education:</strong>&nbsp;Roedean school, Sussex; Aberystwyth University (BA in history)</p> <p><strong>Career:</strong>&nbsp;2012-present: police and crime commissioner for Sussex ; 2019\u2013present: chair, the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC); 2016-present:&nbsp;board member Police ICT Company; 2012\u2013present: chair, Sussex Criminal Justice Board; 2013-2018: board member, the College of Policing; 1998-2005: founder and director, Rebel Roc. </p> <p><strong>Interests:</strong>&nbsp;Running, 40s swing and big band music.</p> <blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> </blockquote>"

     "standfirst": "<p>I was already facing an overload of personal grief. Then the killing of George Floyd opened up generational wounds</p>",
     "body": "<p>At the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-orders-uk-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police\">beginning of lockdown</a> I had this fantasy, like a lot of other people, that I would have time to tidy my house, give it a spring clean, pick up my violin and learn to play it again, and rest my soul. But it is hard to fathom how much sad news we would all face. As for so many other people, every morning \u2013 with its former routine of getting ready, having an hour\u2019s trip into work \u2013 was disrupted. I could just have a quick shower and put on a top half for the meetings. I would roll out of bed and on to the computer, and there I would stay until I was called by the grumblings of my belly to get something to eat. And I would not leave the computer until 9pm or 10pm. I had to keep going: I could feel the desperation in the voices of the people I spoke to.</p> <p>The death rate in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/27/people-were-abandoned-injustices-of-pandemic-laid-bare-in-brent\">my constituency of Brent</a> was going up. I was speaking confidentially to doctors who informed me, in great depth, of the full range of coronavirus symptoms and the dangers of the disease, attacking the brain, the heart, the lungs, the kidneys. I had to digest that information and manage my role as an MP and a member of society. It was quite a heavy burden.</p> <p>On top of wave after wave of the grief my constituents were suffering and sharing with me, Covid-19 hit my own family. My uncle died of it. He had reached a good age, but it was hard not being there, because we\u2019re a big family and we grieve together. His only son, Johnny, had died just a few weeks earlier, so the grief was compounded. It felt like an overload of grief; too much to handle. Media outlets wanted me to discuss it. I couldn\u2019t share or talk about it. Then my auntie\u2019s husband fell sick. His son came over to look after him, and died. Then my auntie\u2019s husband died. There was more grief, more pain that couldn\u2019t be shared, that had to be processed alone by all of us.</p> <p>Because I\u2019m an MP, people think I know what the government is doing. But I\u2019m in opposition, not in government. My job in parliament is to hold the government to account; I\u2019m not at cabinet meetings hearing all the decisions. I was receiving letters and emails full of questions and a lot of fake news, but I understood that most people were experiencing a gap between what was happening to them and what the government was telling them, so they filled that space with their own consciousness or conspiracies. And sometimes they were right, and sometimes they were very much off the mark. I couldn\u2019t bridge the gap for them. I didn\u2019t know myself \u2013 how could I build resilience in them?</p> <p>And then: eight minutes and 46 seconds happened. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/27/george-floyd-police-violence-minnesota-racist\">brutal killing of George Floyd</a> in Minneapolis. This very public lynching opened up generational wounds and generational trauma, for me personally and for many others.</p> <p>Structural and systemic racism has existed for 400 or 500 years. It\u2019s a social construct designed to allow one group of human beings to dehumanise another based on the easily seen colour of a person\u2019s skin. It is designed to make one group of people feel superior and another inferior. If you don\u2019t believe me, believe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\">the Covid-19 body count</a>: I haven\u2019t seen convincing evidence of a biological<strong> </strong>reason why the death toll is so much higher in black African, Caribbean, Asian and minority ethnic people. Covid-19 doesn\u2019t prefer one person\u2019s set of lungs to another\u2019s: we\u2019re all from the human race. It\u2019s not the virus that discriminates, it\u2019s society.</p> <p>My mother taught me resilience; my brothers taught me resistance. My mother sent me to school in the morning saying to myself: \u201cSticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never hurt me.\u201d I would skip along the road singing that tune. But the fights I had in school happened because the other children were calling me names. It wasn\u2019t true that words didn\u2019t hurt. My brothers told me: \u201cSis, if you\u2019re in trouble, don\u2019t call the police, call us. We will come and help you. The police won\u2019t help you.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d heard the stories about how the police treated my brothers. When I started driving, my brothers told me to look in my mirror when a police car drove past, and if they turned around to follow me, to make sure I stopped in a very public place. The police often help me and protect me, not least by dealing with my hate mail. The majority of police officers are good, but this is about systemic and systematic racism.</p> <p>My brothers were teaching me resistance tools. My parents had a form of resilience to survive, to get us here, and my generation was retaliating and fighting. Now the new generation has all of that plus social media and a worldwide connection, and that makes their movement different.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/29/racism-coronavirus-covid-19-black-brown-america\">Racism and Covid-19 threaten our health \u2013 we can't fight them as separate battles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Resilience comes from the Latin meaning rebound, recoil \u2013 the mental ability to recover quickly from misfortune, illness or depression. Somehow, in lockdown, we have had to find and build our resilience, and we have to keep learning.

Ours is the struggle of a lifetime, or maybe even many lifetimes, and each one of us in every generation must do our part. And if we believe in the change we seek, then it is easy to commit to doing all we can, because the responsibility is ours alone to build a better society and a more peaceful world.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t know how this journey will end, but I think that what we will take from this time will be that systemic and systematic racism needs to end, and each and every one of us has to call it out.

His lifelong quest to create what he later characterized as \u201cgood trouble\u201d made him a quintessential figure of the times, one whose authentic love of poor, unlettered peoples was rooted in his own humble origins that began in a shotgun shack in 1940, just outside Troy, Alabama.</p> <p>Lewis\u2019s preternaturally calm demeanor, southern drawl and genuine humility lulled opponents and even friends into underestimating him. In truth, he contained multitudes, a complexity that reflects the richness of the movement and era that shaped him.</p> <p>As chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Lewis matched a personal and tactical commitment to nonviolence with a passion for ending a caste system rooted in racial slavery, segregation, poverty and violence. His youthful militancy was on full display at the March on Washington in 1963, where he vowed to help lead a relentless pursuit of racial justice and citizenship:</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In truth, he contained multitudes, a complexity that reflects the richness of the movement and era that shaped him</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe must say, \u2018Wake up America.

Over the next 30 years Lewis proved to be a resolute legislator who, more often than not, sided with underdogs of all stripes and maintained an uncompromising champion of racial justice.</p> <p>After backing Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries he switched sides, taking a gamble on a young senator from Illinois who identified as part of the \u201cJoshua Generation\u201d made possible by the activism of King and Lewis.</p> <p>Barack Obama\u2019s election helped ensure Lewis\u2019s national veneration since he, in contrast to Jesse Jackson, became <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/18/john-lewis-barack-obama-oprah-winfrey-tributes-civl-rights\">the first Black president\u2019s favorite living civil rights icon</a>. But the growing national recognition of Lewis as the \u201cconscience of the Congress\u201d at times obscured the halting nature of American racial progress.</p> <p>Lewis did indeed stand tall at Selma as blows rained down, and in doing so bore witness to the depth and breadth of white supremacist violence against peaceful demonstrators. In the age of Obama, Lewis\u2019s heroism became part of a triumphant national narrative about the civil rights movement that extolled the sacrifice of veterans of the 1960s who enabled contemporary freedoms, including the astonishing elections of Obama in 2008 and 2012.</p> <p>But as the galvanic national and global protests in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder have revealed, levels of Black equality presumed to have been won during the movement\u2019s heroic age have proven largely illusory. As has the seeming permanence of watershed legislation such as the Voting Rights Act, which has been largely curtailed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/jun/25/supreme-court-voting-rights-act-live\">a 2013 supreme court decision, Shelby v Holder</a>, that undermines democracy by sanctioning widespread voter suppression tactics.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Lewis, at an early age, recognized the Black freedom struggle as a marathon and not a sprint</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Black Lives Matter movement cast an important spotlight on the importance of Lewis\u2019s extraordinary and lifelong commitment to ending systemic racism and defeating white supremacy. Lewis, at an early age, recognized the Black freedom struggle as a marathon and not a sprint. On this score he met and admired Malcolm X even as he retained an unswerving commitment to non-violent civil disobedience. Lewis retained a special love for King but embraced the recent BLM protests that have rocked the world as a long-overdue reckoning that might complete the struggle for dignity and citizenship that he waged his entire life.</p> <p>Lewis\u2019s most important legacy, then, surpasses both the real and imagined triumphs that resulted in his election to Congress, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/18/john-lewis-barack-obama-oprah-winfrey-tributes-civl-rights\">friendship with Obama</a>, presidential medal of freedom and widespread admiration from supporters and even former adversaries that he claimed over the course of his life and political career. His most important legacy resides in his service-oriented political leadership, unapologetic struggle for Black dignity and citizenship, and embrace of a younger and combative generation of activists who reminded him and the nation of the still unfinished business of achieving racial justice in America and around the world.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Peniel E Joseph is the founding director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy at the LBJ School of Public Affairs and professor of history at the University of Texas at Austin.

     "body": "<p>Pity the poor culture warrior, their mental gymnastics burning far more calories than pre-corona gym sessions ever could.<br><br>A statue was torn down, and they demanded people follow the proper channels. Statues were taken down via the \u201cproper channels\u201d, and they decried the panicked response. Reviews were announced to avoid a panicked response, and they raged against the reviews. When all else fails, they just conjure controversy out of thin air. <br><br>Take the Telegraph. Last week it <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/29/york-minsters-roman-emperor-statue-looked-following-complaints/?utm_content=telegraph&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=Echobox&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1593504863\">claimed</a> that the future of a 22-year-old statue of the Roman emperor Constantine outside York Minster was being \u201clooked at\u201d, after church officials \u201creceived complaints that the Roman emperor supported slavery\u201d. The story was then picked up by the Daily Mail. <br><br>There was one problem. York Minster swiftly clarified it had not received a single complaint about the statue, and ruled out removing it.<br><br>This is part of a pattern. Shortly after Edward Colston\u2019s statue was torn down in Bristol, Boris Johnson played up the threat to the Westminster statue of Winston Churchill. Hardly anyone was calling for its removal, but Johnson made it the centre of his response to the Black Lives Matter protests, and the Telegraph duly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/1272273520593166337/photo/1\">plastered it across the front page</a>. <br><br>Write-ups of the Churchill statue also <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/12/war-winston-sadiq-khan-covered-churchill/\">focused on the role of London mayor Sadiq Khan</a>, a go-to hate figure on the nationalist right. This tactic was repeated recently, when newspapers roped Meghan Markle into their <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8443231/Prince-Harry-backs-ban-Swing-Low-Sweet-Chariot.html\">coverage</a> of Prince Harry\u2019s \u201csupport for a ban\u201d (actually a review that almost certainly won\u2019t lead to a ban) of the song Swing Low, Sweet Chariot by the Rugby Football Union. <br><br>The drivers of this dynamic are not hard to identify. Black Lives Matter is a movement, larger and broader than the organisations that bear its name. It challenges the privileges of the majority who do not experience racism, and the image that majority has of Britain and its history. And some of that majority take at least some of the movement\u2019s arguments on board - while others lash out against it.<br><br>Those who lash out are less numerous than you might imagine. Polling conducted days after Colston\u2019s statue was removed found <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/black-lives-matter-protests-poll-exclusive-uk-coronavirus-pandemic-444885\">most respondents agreed</a> with the stated aims of the Black Lives Matter movement. Only 15% disagreed \u2013 around one in seven. Respondents were more evenly divided on the removal of slavery-related statues, and displayed outright hostility to removing Westminster\u2019s Churchill statue.<br><br>But the one in seven who oppose even Black Lives Matter\u2019s broad aims are overrepresented in the rightwing press, on talk radio and the broader network of rage merchants on social media. The organisations they work for claim to represent the unheard British majority, but they do not. They are aghast at the concept of structural racism, which implicates people and institutions far beyond their comfort zone of condemning neo-Nazis and football thugs. <br><br>Their interests are not served by tackling racialised economic inequality. The notion that unequal outcomes have structural causes affronts their smug certainty that it\u2019s all about \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d. And, of course, their bottom lines are not harmed by whipping up rage. <br><br>The problem is that they cannot win fighting against the basic principles of this movement because the public are broadly in favour of them. So their answer is to focus on what people are against, find examples of that, no matter how tenuous, and use them to discredit an entire political project.<br><br>The irony is that these critics of Black Lives Matter call it divisive. Given that the campaign challenges Britain\u2019s self-image, its understanding of its history, and structural discrimination against a minority, what is notable is how little division it has provoked \u2013 contrast the support for BLM in both the US and the UK to the widespread antipathy towards Martin Luther King in the United States of the 1960s. It makes angry people very angry, but they are in the minority.<br><br>Instead, it is supporters of the populist right who are desperate to stoke division by reducing issues of fundamental importance to ephemeral noise and fake news. Their careers, and their ideology, depend on it.</p> <p>\u2022 Chaminda Jayanetti is a journalist who covers politics and public services</p>"

The sweeping bill covers a ban on chokeholds and \u201cqualified immunity\u201d for law enforcement, which would make it easier to prosecute instances of police misconduct, as well as national standards for police accountability.</p> <p>The bill is named in honor of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-who-was-he-his-friends-words\">George Floyd</a>, who was killed by police in Minneapolis in May and whose death sparked nationwide protests for racial justice and against police brutality.

     "body": "<p>The government\u2019s response to the protests of the past week followed a predictable pattern. Step 1: A flurry of headlines <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11844043/violent-black-lives-matter-jail-24-hours/\">promising</a>: \u201cViolent protesters face jail within 24 hours\u201d, optimism unencumbered by any understanding of the law, procedural fairness or how Covid-19-struck criminal courts are operating in practice. Step 2: Announce longer prison sentences for something.</p> <p>That something is apparently low-value criminal damage of war memorials, which, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/13/ten-year-jail-sentences-desecrating-war-memorials/\">according to 125 Conservative MPs</a>, is not being punished severely enough. So it was that backbench demands for a new offence carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years\u2019 custody filled the Sunday press, with MPs vowing not to<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/13/ten-year-jail-sentences-desecrating-war-memorials/\"> </a>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/13/ten-year-jail-sentences-desecrating-war-memorials/\">stand idly by as our democracy is dismantled in this way</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Seemingly sympathetic to the proposition that spray-painting a statue portends the dismantling of democracy, the government has thrown its weight behind the proposals, with the home secretary, attorney general and justice secretary all said to be supportive. What came as perhaps more of a surprise was the opposition joining the chorus. No doubt wary of falling into a populist-shaped elephant trap, the new shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, hitched Labour\u2019s wagon to this nonsense, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/priti-patel-statues-jail-labour-memorial-protests-colston-churchill-a9565066.html\">telling Sky News</a> that he would \u201csupport the government in creating a new specific offence of protecting war memorials\u201d.</p> <p>The notion that a \u201cnew specific offence\u201d is required to prohibit damaging war memorials betrays fundamental misunderstandings of what the law currently says. The Criminal Damage Act 1971 provides a maximum sentence of 10 years\u2019 custody for the offence of criminal damage, and applies to all property, including statues and war memorials. Where a statue is a listed building, a further offence, carrying a maximum sentence of two years, is available under section 7 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.</p> <p>What upsets the campaigners is that where the value of criminal damage is under \u00a35,000, it is treated as a summary-only offence (triable only at the magistrates\u2019 courts) and carries a maximum sentence of three months. So where an unlisted memorial is defaced but the remedial cost is low \u2013 say removing spray paint \u2013 a lengthy spell behind bars is unlikely to follow.</p> <p>The \u201csolution\u201d, we are told, is either to amend the Criminal Damage Act or to pass new legislation \u2013 the desecration of war memorials bill \u2013 allowing the maximum of 10 years to apply, irrespective of the value of the damage (and, in the case of the new bill, there need not even be any damage caused). In their fervour, few of the protagonists seem to have realised that the proposed narrow definition of \u201cwar memorial\u201d would exclude most of the statues and monuments that have captured recent headlines \u2013 neither <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/jun/11/bristol-slave-trader-statue-toppled-by-blm-protesters-retrieved-from-harbour-video\">Colston\u2019s</a> nor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/07/anti-racism-mass-protests-take-place-in-cities-across-the-uk\">Churchill\u2019s</a> statue, nor the memorial to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/15/man-given-14-day-jail-sentence-for-urinating-near-pc-keith-palmer-plaque\">PC Keith Palmer</a>, would qualify for protection, for instance. Nor has it occurred to them that most acts of damage or disrespect to monuments are caused in the context of wider, more serious offending, for which lengthy custodial sentences are already available.</p> <p>But even more troubling is what such an escalation in sentencing powers would represent. While in practice the maximum of 10 years would rarely, if ever, be imposed, the new cross-party consensus appears to be that displaying disrespect \u2013 not even quantifiable damage \u2013 to an inanimate object is worthy of a higher maximum sentence than inflicting grievous bodily harm, violent disorder, affray, theft, carrying knives, acid or offensive weapons, voyeurism, upskirting and causing death by careless driving, to name but a few offences that cause tangible harm to real people. It would inject criminal sentencing, which already suffers from wild incoherence and inconsistency between offence types, with another dose of gratuitous disproportionality.</p> <p>What disappoints most is that the criminal justice system is in desperate need of unified political attention. The system, already on its knees pre-Covid-19, is in tatters. The backlog of cases in the crown courts has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/may/24/has-the-uk-justice-system-been-changed-for-ever-by-the-coronavirus\">soared above 40,000</a> due to year after year of cuts to court sitting days. A lack of police and CPS resources means that it typically takes over a year to charge many cases, with victims, witnesses and the accused then subjected to a further wait of at least a year for a crown court trial date.</p> <p>Publicly funded lawyers, starved of government financial assistance, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12837f33-9c30-4588-8948-56736ac130f2\">are going to the wall</a>. We still have Chris Grayling\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ditch-innocence-tax-in-criminal-courts-government-urged-gm6nvp9sj\">innocence tax</a>\u201d, whereby the government refuses you legal aid and, when you are acquitted, refuses to fully reimburse your legal fees, leaving you thousands of pounds out of pocket for having been wrongly accused. And, bringing the conversation back to where attention should rightly be focused at this time, the 35 recommendations in the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/643001/lammy-review-final-report.pdf\">2017 Lammy review</a> into the treatment of BAME individuals in the criminal justice system are, three years on, yet to be implemented.</p> <p>Yet somehow, our elected representatives have surveyed the wreckage of the criminal justice system, and considered the burning social injustices dragged into the spotlight by the BLM protests, and have concluded that the priority \u2013 the first piece of bipartisan criminal legislation they should pass \u2013 is one seeking to protect the feelings of concrete.

Survival is what we do | Melissa Lucashenko</a> </p> </aside>  <p>NSW Health\u2019s Dr Jeremy McAnulty rated the risk of transmission at the rally as \u201cmedium\u201d and told the court he was concerned about whether social distancing could be maintained.</p> <p>Organisers have nevertheless promised to risk arrest and gather outside Town Hall at noon on Tuesday as planned. They will then walk to Parliament House to deliver a petition calling for justice for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/11/the-story-of-david-dungay-and-an-indigenous-death-in-custody\">David Dungay Jr, a Dunghutti man who died in a Sydney jail in 2015</a>.</p> <p>His nephew Paul Silva told Guardian Australia the rally would go ahead: \u201cOur family is going to take to the streets to demand justice.</p> <p>\u201cThe only way that\u2019s going to stop this protest is if the premier calls Safe Work New South Wales and calls the Department of Public Prosecutions to undertake an investigation. Otherwise, we\u2019ll continue to take to the streets, whether it be with 40 people, or 40,000 people.</p> <p>\u201cOur family is determined to get justice for David Dungay Jr and demand systematic change for the First Nations people here in Australia.</p> <p>\u201cThe Australian government, NSW courts and NSW police should be very grateful that we\u2019re not looting and rioting, like what\u2019s happening in the US.\u201d</p> <p>Silva said the family were committed to peaceful protests: \u201cWe just know that violence isn\u2019t going solve this. These are peaceful protests and we\u2019re going to demand justice in a peaceful way until someone in government hears our voices and steps up to the table and says enough\u2019s enough. We\u2019re going to make systemic changes for this and it\u2019s got to happen sooner or later.\u201d</p> <p>Gibson\u2019s lawyer had argued that yelling \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d in a protest was more important to a democratic society than going to a football match, and thus should also be accommodated in times of pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cGoing to the aquarium, going to sex-on-premises venues, going to football matches \u2013 these aren\u2019t essential to our democracy,\u201d Felicity Graham said. \u201cProtest is.\u201d</p> <p>Gibson produced a Covid-19 safety plan like those businesses require to operate, in which he said people should wear masks, practice hand hygiene and leave contact details with organisers so they could be notified in the event a demonstrator tested positive to coronavirus.</p> <p>Justice Ierace acknowledged there was no evidence a far larger rally on 6 June \u2013 attended by at least 10,000 \u2013 had resulted in any transmission of coronavirus. But the expert health evidence had since been elevated to \u201cmedium\u201d due to multiple clusters in Sydney and the resurgence of the virus in Victoria, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThat current assessment of the level of risk, in spite of relatively low numbers of community transmission, is consistent with NSW presently being on the knife-edge of a further escalation in community transmission,\u201d Justice Ierace said in written reasons.</p> <p>He found the protest\u2019s lunchtime CBD location \u201cparticularly concerning\u201d as large numbers of pedestrians not associated with the protest would move through the area and would not be leaving contact details.</p> <p>In a statement on Sunday afternoon, the NSW police said anyone contemplating attending the rally was \u201cstrongly urged to reconsider their plans\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the NSW police force recognises and supports the rights of individuals to exercise their right to free speech, large-scale events, such as these, are currently subject to restrictions under the Public Health Act. As such, police will not hesitate to take the appropriate action, if required.\u201d</p>"

She shut them down to protect her friend McMichael.\u201d</p> <p>Days later, Johnson recused herself. Johnson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>By 27 February, George Barnhill, the Waycross judicial district attorney, and the second of three DAs on the case, took over. Less than 24 hours after seeing the video and evidence compiled by the police, Murphy said, Barnhill decided to not charge the McMichaels.</p> <p>\u201cAnd so within 24 hours the Glynn county police had been told by two separate DA offices not to make any arrests,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cAnd obviously, they want to assume no responsibility for their actions.\u201d</p> <p>On 2 April, Barnhill sent an email to law enforcement authorities saying Arbery had an \u201capparent aggressive nature\u201d and that his family were \u201cnot strangers to the local criminal justice system\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cArbery\u2019s mental health records &amp; prior convictions help explain his apparent aggressive nature and his possible thought pattern to attack an armed man,\u201d Barnhill <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6916-george-barnhill-letter-to-glyn/b52fa09cdc974b970b79/optimized/full.pdf\">said in the email,</a> which was first reported by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/opinion/ahmaud-arbery-killing.html\">New York Times</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d67f4973fb543d9cf049d5b6ff16a2d78d85235\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d67f4973fb543d9cf049d5b6ff16a2d78d85235/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People protest outside the Glynn county courthouse in Brunswick, Georgia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People protest outside the Glynn county courthouse in Brunswick, Georgia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dustin Chambers/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat it appears is he was purposely trying to assault the character of the victim and there\u2019s just no reason why,\u201d said Chris Stewart, one of the lawyers representing Arbery\u2019s family.</p> <p>The family have pointed to the McMichaels\u2019 connection to local law enforcement both at the district attorney\u2019s office and police department as evidence of systemic flaws and roadblocks in their search for justice. It was only after the video of Arbery\u2019s death was released this week that the third DA\u2019s office requested the Georgia Bureau of Investigations (GBI) get involved.</p> <p>On Friday, GBI director Vic Reynolds told reporters he could not \u201canswer what another agency did or didn\u2019t see\u201d in the first two months of the investigation.</p> <p>\u201cBut I can tell you that based on our involvement in this case and considering the fact we hit the ground running Wednesday morning and within 36 hours we had secured warrants for two individuals for felony murder, I think that speaks volumes for itself.\u201d</p> <p>In a 7 April email sent to the office of Georgia attorney general Chris Carr, Barnhill recused himself because his son worked on a case involving Arbery while working in Johnson\u2019s office.</p> <p>Lee Merritt, one of the lawyers who represents Arbery\u2019s family, said Wanda Cooper-Jones, Arbery\u2019s mother, found the connection between Barnhill\u2019s son and her own on Facebook and brought it to the attention of his office.</p> <p>\u201cShe followed the links. That\u2019s exactly how it happened,\u201d he said to the Guardian on Friday by phone.</p> <p>According to a police report filed 23 February, Gregory and Travis McMichael grabbed their weapons, a .357 Magnum revolver and a shotgun, jumped into a truck and followed Arbery as he ran.</p> <p>In the email to Carr from early April, Barnhill references a \u201cdecent cell phone video of the entire shooting incident\u201d, an apparent reference to the one leaked this week.</p> <p>Reynolds said on Friday that the investigation into the shooting, the video and the person who filmed it, would continue.</p> <p>\u201cEvery stone will be uncovered,\u201d Reynolds said.<br></p>"

There was also a soundtrack that went along with it called Black Righteous Space, which has speeches and music from Afro Caribbean and African American movements of the past,\u201d he adds. \u201cBurning Man isn\u2019t the most culturally diverse place, so it was monumental as a statement.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jan/21/art-made-for-instagram-is-taking-over-festivals-and-taking-us-away-from-the-experience-of-it\">recent wave</a> of public art as a mere selfie op <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/selfie-factories-instagram-museum/\">for Instagrammers</a>, Thomas still believes that it can spark action, that art can influence the public vote. \u201cWe see how political public space is.

How do we continue to redefine and open new doors for other people to get more access to liberty and justice?\u201d</p> <p>Many Americans are looking forward to changing the course of the country with the election, but Thomas says that might not be the ultimate answer. \u201cA single election doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything helps \u2013 even the current president helps because he helps show what\u2019s at stake when we don\u2019t engage.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas believes artists have an ability to see the future, that they can channel what they have seen through their artwork.</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t just artists, it\u2019s activists, as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe may not see or be there for the final moment, as Martin Luther King Jr said on the night he was murdered: \u2018I\u2019ve seen the mountaintop. <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/martin-luther-kings-final-speech-ive-mountaintop-full/story?id=18872817\">I might not get there with you.</a>\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI feel like that\u2019s so prophetic, so frightening, but I understand more about what he\u2019s saying,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cThe road towards progress is always under construction.

The arrest comes after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/ahmaud-arbery-video-shooting-sharing-viral\">video released</a> this week showed an unarmed Arbery, who is black, confronted by the elder McMichael, a former county police officer, and his son, who shot Arbery seconds later.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/ahmaud-arbery-parents-call-for-arrests-killing-song-daily-jog\">Ahmaud Arbery's parents call for arrests after 'modern lynching in the middle of the day'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The shooting took place more than two months ago on 23 February, and family members have expressed outrage and anger that the two men had not been charged. The incidents around the shooting remained unclear until an anonymous witness leaked a 36-second video including the moment of Arbery\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>According to a police report filed that day, the two McMichaels grabbed their weapons, a .357 Magnum revolver and a shotgun, jumped into a truck and followed Arbery as he ran. In the same police report, they tell police Arbery matched the description of someone caught on a security camera committing a recent burglary in the neighborhood. Gregory McMichael told police Arbery violently attacked his son, which contradicts the footage.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ff982312-edb3-412b-afb8-5d08db8a14a9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8EysSdqmQQI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Arbery\u2019s family has called for immediate arrests after the video was released this week. Celebrities and politicians, from LeBron James to Democratic candidate and former vice-president Joe Biden, expressed outrage and called for action. Until the footage was released this week, no charges or arrests had taken place.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still in tears,\u201d said Chris Stewart on Thursday evening after he heard the news. Stewart, who represents Arbery\u2019s family, is a civil rights attorney who is working with the team of lawyers representing the family, including Lee Merritt and Ben Crump.</p> \n<p>The family is overjoyed, Stewart told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>Two prosecutors have recused themselves from the case since the shooting, citing professional relationships with the older McMichael. Neighboring Liberty county district attorney Tim Durden, the third prosecutor assigned to the case, formally requested an investigation by GBI on 5 May, after the video was released. They initiated an investigation on 6 May, leading to an arrest Thursday evening.</p> \n<p>Soon after the video was released, Georgia\u2019s governor, Brian Kemp, and the state\u2019s attorney general Chris Carr called for swift action. Kemp called the shooting \u201cabsolutely horrific\u201d in a press conference Thursday.</p> \n<p>The Glynn county police department never requested an independent investigation of the incident and did not charge anyone in the incident.</p> \n<p>Thursday, the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/ahmaud-arbery-killing-man-called-911-report-black-male-running-shooting\">obtained two 911 calls</a>, where an unidentified caller tells the dispatcher: \u201cThere\u2019s a black male running down the street.\u201d In another call, a different dispatcher asks another caller to explain what Arbery has done that is wrong.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c7b8757e-9cfa-4b76-abf6-2025f7636ea1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uFgy5ZT-1PA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not over,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cThis is the beginning.

     "body": "<p>It is 8am and Vivica A Fox, the star of two Independence Day films, two seasons of Curb Your Enthusiasm, both parts of Kill Bill and, latterly, two Sharknado movies, has been awake for hours. She sprang out of bed at 4am, pottered around and \u201cdid a little social media post\u201d about her podcast, <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-coach-mike-podcast/hustling-with-vivica-a-fox#/\">Hustling with Vivica A Fox</a>. It\u2019s a spin-off from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Every-Day-Hustling-Vivica-Fox/dp/1250134455\">Every Day I\u2019m Hustling</a>, her memoir-cum-self-help manual which contains health tips (\u201cHydrate, girl!\u201d), social media advice (\u201cUse hashtags to join big conversations\u201d) and underwear secrets (\u201cI\u2019m a G-string type of gal\u201d). Once the podcast was online this morning, she explains, \u201cI said to myself: \u2018Let\u2019s get some coffee on. It\u2019s <em>showtime</em>!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>First on the agenda is the droll new thriller <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9139586/\">Arkansas</a>, in which she plays the mysterious \u201cHer\u201d, who works as go-between in a drugs ring and is first seen in curlers, toe separators and a jazzy kaftan; Liam Hemsworth, Vince Vaughn and John Malkovich struggle in vain not to be outshone. Down the line from her villa in the San Fernando Valley, where she has a spectacular living room view of the Santa Susana mountains, Fox talks through the various traits of Her: the character\u2019s serenity (\u201cThat came from my mother, who\u2019s religious\u201d); her cool control (\u201cI brought in a presidential thing there\u201d); her no-nonsense efficiency (\u201cA lil\u2019 bit of my gangsta style\u201d). But we are done with Arkansas in under five minutes, which is roughly the combined length of her scenes in the film.</p> <p>Besides, there is so much more to discuss. Fox is 55 and has played an influential part in shaping on-screen images of African American life. By the time she was seen in 1996 in <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/vivica-fox-longer-stripping-tips-independence-day-sequel/story?id=40102984\">Independence Day</a> as Will Smith\u2019s girlfriend, a pole-dancer with (you\u2019ll never guess) a heart of gold, she had already put in a decade\u2019s hard graft on soap operas and sitcoms. Worried that people would be flummoxed by her unusual first name, she sometimes introduced herself back then by her middle name, Angie. That was until a female casting director pointed out that her full name would double also as a factual statement: \u201cVivica\u2019s a fox.\u201d</p> <p>Independence Day gave her a movie career but it was the heist thriller<a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/05/vivica-a-fox-answers-every-question-we-have-about-set-it-off.html\"> Set It Off</a> a few months later that demonstrated her range and vitality. The film remains special to her; she tells me there is a framed poster of it in the room she\u2019s calling from. \u201cSet It Off got me my street cred,\u201d she says. \u201cI was the good-looking kid on the block at the time. Then everyone saw that and said: \u2018Oh, she <em>hood</em>.\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiDS8yudx4c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jiDS8yudx4c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>One fleeting moment in that movie demonstrates her knack for identifying small but revealing details in any scene. Her character Frankie has just been interrogated aggressively by white detectives who wrongly suspect her of colluding in a violent bank robbery. Getting up to leave, she pauses in front of the only black female officer in the room, who has been quietly sipping water, and says: \u201cYou didn\u2019t even bother to ask me if I was thirsty, <em>sister</em>.\u201d</p> <p>There was no scripted interaction between the women: Fox improvised that line, which addresses racial and gender solidarity more adroitly than some of the film\u2019s bombastic monologues. \u201cThat small bit of humanity was important,\u201d she says. She is proud now that several of her early pictures made what she calls \u201cculturally driven statements\u201d. Set It Off \u201cwas about how we get screwed over in life, especially women\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lKicGtI-WI\">Soul Food</a> \u201cshowed the African American family expressing fellowship through food\u201d. The romantic comedy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-9Z1Lyo7vI\">Two Can Play That Game</a> demonstrated \u201cblack love, how we love each other\u201d and featured African American characters whose wealth was unconnected to drugs or crime. \u201cI fought very hard for those images. I got on everybody\u2019s damn nerves but it was worth it,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For Kill Bill, I went from a size 10 to a two. Tarantino turned us all into assassins</p> <footer> <cite>Vivica A Fox</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Opposition came in many forms. \u201cWe were told people didn\u2019t want to see our stories: \u2018You be the sidekick\u2019. We were told African American women can\u2019t lead films. Or that the only stories we could tell were in the past,\u201d says Fox. There is still work to be done. \u201cI\u2019d love to see more docuseries showing that the contribution of African Americans doesn\u2019t always have to be through entertainment. We need to educate children so they don\u2019t think they have to grow up and be athletes or rappers. They can be lawyers and scientists, too.\u201d</p> <p>Fox\u2019s own career has scarcely been inhibited by external expectations. \u201cVersatility equals longevity,\u201d as she says. When she noticed in the late 2000s that she was losing parts because she was \u201ctoo good-looking for older roles but too old to play the It girl,\u201d she diversified: she got some theatre work under her belt and launched her lucrative hair collection. One of her brightest spots came when she was cast in Curb Your Enthusiasm as Loretta Black, who is taken in by Larry David along with her family after being left homeless by a hurricane.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz3jbg2Dkn4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tz3jbg2Dkn4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The show is not scripted and she found the improvisations taxing, though perhaps not as tough as being banned from having her hair down or wearing makeup. \u201cLarry was a stickler. I\u2019d put on lipgloss and he\u2019d say: \u2018Are you wearing makeup?\u2019 I was, like: \u2018Dude. Really?\u2019\u201d But there was a point to it all. \u201cHe wanted Loretta to evolve so that when she\u2019s finally all dressed up, you\u2019ve seen her grow.\u201d In the final episode of that season, she and David dance together at a bat mitzvah and their romance (cruelly snuffed out in the next season, but never mind) starts to blossom. \u201cLarry was so nervous before that scene. He was walking around dabbing peppermint on his tongue. He said: \u2018I\u2019ve gotta make sure my breath is fresh for you.\u2019 Aww!\u201d</p> <p>It is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mk_f75TS1A\">Kill Bill</a>, though, that she singles out as her proudest achievement. Why that film? \u201cWoooh, chile! That was six months of sacrifice. I went from a size 10 to a two. Tarantino turned us all into assassins.\u201d At one point during the months of arduous martial arts training, she upbraided the director in front of the rest of the cast after he had accused them of not giving their all. It was Uma Thurman who took her aside later and advised her to \u201clearn how to manipulate the situation to get what you want\u201d. It chimed for her with a phrase her father always used: attack intelligently.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ivanka said to me: You speak very well.\u2019 I was like: What?

That\u2019s why I\u2019m up here in my mountains.\u201d</p> <p>At least she can watch Kill Bill and see that all the physical suffering was worth it. \u201cQuentin told me: \u2018You\u2019ll appreciate it later.\u2019 And then I saw how great my butt looked. I even had a booty light! When Uma and I are standing in front of the window and the school bus pulls up, there it was. My booty light. Go back and look!\u201d I promise her I will. After all, I know how much that booty means to her from her recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/4enoyreveAPP/status/1274099238167773186?s=20\">retweet</a> of a fan who remarked \u201cVivica\u2019s ass in the 90s was the perfect combination of both fit and fat.\u201d</p> <p>Her memories of Kill Bill acquired a bittersweet tinge when Thurman revealed in 2018 that she was attacked by Harvey Weinstein prior to making the film (during his downfall, Thurman <a href=\"https://nationalpost.com/entertainment/celebrity/im-glad-its-going-slowly-you-dont-deserve-a-bullet-uma-thurman-addresses-harvey-weinstein\">wrote</a> on Instagram: \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s going slowly \u2013 you don\u2019t deserve a bullet\u201d) and that Tarantino endangered her life on set by forcing her to drive a stunt car which then crashed. \u201cI had no idea at the time,\u201d Fox says. \u201cThat woman is graceful. Uma I consider a quiet storm. I didn\u2019t know she crashed the car. I was, like: \u2018Oh my God!\u2019 She never told any of us.\u201d Nor did Fox encounter the predatory side of Weinstein, with whom she went on to make the fairytale comedy Ella Enchanted. \u201cHe was nice.

In the meantime, here\u2019s a summary of where we are at:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The Jefferson county grand jury has indicted one of the officers involved in the shooting of <strong>Breonna Taylor. </strong>Former Louisville police officer <strong>Brett Hankinson</strong> faces three felony counts of first-degree wanton endangerment. None of the other officers involved in the fatal shooting were indicted. No homicide charges were issued.</li> \n   <li><strong>Thousands of people joined protests in many major US city which saw protesters chanting \u201cSay her name! Breonna Taylor\u201d and \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d.</strong> Posters and shrines dedicated to Taylor were seen all around as protesters marched.</li> \n   <li><strong>Two police officers in Louisville were shot and suffered non-life-threatening injuries.</strong> Louisville police have one suspect in custody.</li> \n   <li><strong>A car drove through protests in Denver,</strong> there were no injuries. <strong>Chemical agents were used on protesters by the authorities in Atlanta </strong>and other cities. <strong>A riot was declare in Portland, Oregon</strong>, where police shared a video which appeared to show them being attacked with a Molotov cocktail.</li> \n   <li>Civil rights attorney <strong>Ben Crump, </strong>who is representing the family of <strong>Breonna Taylor, </strong>described the grand jury announcement as \u201coutrageous and offensive.\u201d Crump noted that none of the charges announced today appear to relate directly to the fatal shooting of Taylor. \u201cIf <strong>Brett Hankison</strong>\u2019s behavior was wanton endangerment to people in neighboring apartments, then it should have been wanton endangerment in Breonna Taylor\u2019s apartment too. In fact, it should have been ruled wanton murder,\u201d Crump said in a tweet.</li> \n   <li><strong>Taylor\u2019s mother, Tamika Palmer, learned of the charging decision minutes before attorney general\u2019s announcement. </strong>The family\u2019s attorney, Sam Aguiar, told CNN: \u201cShe had to drive all the way down there to be told this, despite two advanced requests from me to not force her to drive down only to learn no indictments.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>You can continue to follow the latest developments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/sep/24/breonna-taylor-donald-trump-joe-biden-black-lives-matter-coronavirus-covid-19-louisville-live-updates\">over here</a>\u2026</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/sep/24/breonna-taylor-donald-trump-joe-biden-black-lives-matter-coronavirus-covid-19-louisville-live-updates\">Breonna Taylor decision: riot declared in Portland as protests grip US cities \u2013 US politics live</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f6c796f8f08504db47e6145\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-09-24T10:49:22.808Z\">11.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Another New York Times columnist, <strong>Charles M.

In a piece headlined <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/opinion/breonna-taylor-charges-racism.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">\u201cIt hurts to keep hoping for justice\u201d</a>, Price picks up on Kentucky\u2019s attorney general, Daniel Cameron using the phrase \u201cMob justice is not justice\u201d. She writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All Ms. Taylor\u2019s family wanted, and all many of the protesters wanted, is for the Constitution and the mechanism of justice to work for them the way it works for others. Mr. Cameron, who is Black, should know that to suggest that protesters are nothing but a mob dehumanizes the people calling for justice and respect. And it reminds African-Americans of the way we\u2019re so often unfairly portrayed as perpetrators of crime, and so rarely seen as victims.</p> \n   <p>Police officers who kill citizens are rarely convicted. But in this tragic situation, in which the woman killed was not only unarmed but asleep in the moments before a police officer took her life, we hoped that for once, justice would be on our side. This is yet another disappointing reminder that it\u2019s not.</p> \n   <p>These efforts take a cumulative toll. Young African-Americans consuming a regular diet of Black death are learning to not trust their government. <strong>It\u2019s painful to realize that kneeling for the national anthem can cost a football player like Colin Kaepernick his career, but a police officer firing a deadly shot into an innocent young woman\u2019s home late at night will face no consequences.</strong> Black people will try to make sense of this, try to rebuild whatever expectation of safety we can muster, and tap into coping mechanisms that are now so familiar. Preparing for moments like this feels like a futile job that can never really soften the actual experience.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Read it here: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/opinion/breonna-taylor-charges-racism.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage\"><strong>New York Times \u2013 Melanye Price: It hurts to keep hoping for justice</strong></a><br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-09-24T10:50:03.564Z\">at 11.50am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f6c72e38f08ec5446e7566a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-09-24T10:21:35.090Z\">11.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Facebook to launch long-delayed independent oversight board in October</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Also with the election in mind, here is some social media news. <strong>Facebook\u2019s long-delayed independent oversight board plans to launch in mid-to-late October</strong>, just before the presidential election, although a board member said he did not know whether it would hear cases related to the contest</p> \n  <p>The board, announced by Facebook in response to criticism of its handling of problematic content, will initially have the power to review decisions to take down posts from Facebook and Instagram, and recommend policy changes.</p> \n  <p>Elizabeth Culliford reports for Reuters that some experts have said it will not be able to help combat misinformation, because it will have no authority at first to evaluate posts that the company decides to leave up.</p> \n  <p>Oversight board member \u2013 and former Guardian editor \u2013 Alan Rusbridger told Reuters in an interview that the board was now aiming for an October launch.

Police quickly extinguished the flames as they burned the edge of an awning. But soon after, someone threw a Molotov cocktail toward officers. Police ordered the hundreds of people gathered in honor of Breonna Taylor to leave, then used force to make people move. Federal officers helped.</p> \n   <p>Federal officers shot impact munitions on downtown streets a half-mile away from the federal courthouse that President Donald Trump pledged to protect. The scene mirrored many July nights, when federal officers regularly and aggressively dispersed crowds outside the courthouse. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Read it here: <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/09/portland-protest-grows-downtown-on-eve-of-breonna-taylor-grand-jury-decision.html\"><strong>Oregon Live \u2013 Portland, federal police break up downtown protest of Breonna Taylor grand jury decision</strong></a></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-09-24T10:29:46.434Z\">at 11.29am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5f6c54e78f08eef20fb28e15\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-09-24T08:16:23.101Z\">9.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Away from the protests for a moment, the Associated Press is reporting that <strong>the US justice department is investigating a former Republican Florida Congresswoman accused of spending at least $50,000 of campaign money on vacations and restaurant and luxury hotel bills</strong>.</p> \n  <p>The federal department\u2019s public integrity section is looking into the expenditures by Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, from Miami, including a 2017 trip to Walt Disney World with her children and grandchildren, rooms at a Ritz-Carlton resort and a New Year\u2019s Eve meal at a high-end seafood restaurant.<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b216e9ac554b9de2447331a5fd7f8b61373b8345\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b216e9ac554b9de2447331a5fd7f8b61373b8345/2_55_4215_2529/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In this 2015 file photo, Rep.

Breonna Taylor\u201d and \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d. </strong>Posters and shrines dedicated to Taylor were seen all around as protesters marched.</li> \n   <li><strong>Two police officers in Louisville were shot and suffered non-life-threatening injuries.</strong> Louisville police have one suspect in custody, but it is unclear whether the suspect and the shooting were related to protests in the city. One officer is undergoing surgery while the second is alert and stable.

to 'go home tonight'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A short while ago, the Kentucky governor, <strong>Andy Beshear,</strong> released a video statement in which he asks that protesters leave the streets and go home in light of the shooting of two officers. </p> \n  <p>Here is the full transcript of what he said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I know that with the events of today, many people are feeling powerful emotions. Whether that\u2019s frustration, anger, concern. And many people have been out on the streets, especially in Louisville tonight, giving voice to those emotions. But sadly we have seen at least one individual turn what were non-violent ways of expressing ourselves into the shooting of at least two law enforcement officers. </p> \n   <p><strong>We know that the answer to violence is never violence. And we are thinking about those two officers and their families tonight. So I\u2019m asking everybody, please, go home. Go home tonight. </strong></p> \n   <p>There will be many times over the coming days where there will be an opportunity to be heard, and so many people are listening right now. </p> \n   <p>As your governor I\u2019ve promised to listen. But let\u2019s make sure we don\u2019t see any more violence tonight. And let\u2019s make sure that we find ways of expressing ourselves moving forward where your point and other people\u2019s points are made and that hopefully we can not just listen, but hear. </p> \n   <p>Everybody out there stay safe. We care about each and every one of you. Goodnight.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GovAndyBeshear/status/1308957526801645570\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A message from Governor Beshear on events tonight in Louisville. <a href=\"https://t.co/XK8FZSXy8D\">pic.twitter.com/XK8FZSXy8D</a></p>\u2014 Governor Andy Beshear (@GovAndyBeshear) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GovAndyBeshear/status/1308957526801645570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 24, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Earlier today, Beshear called on the state attorney general, <strong>Daniel Cameron</strong>, to release online all the information he can about the Breonna Taylor case.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI believe that the public deserves this information,\u201d said the Democrat governor. \u201cI trust Kentuckians.

You just have to be excellent.

Stephen Collinson and Caitlin Hu for <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/specials/meanwhile-in-america\">CNN\u2019s Meanwhile in America</a> newsletter this morning write scathingly on what it revealed about US foreign policy under Trump:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If President Donald Trump\u2019s grievance-filled video rant to the UN General Assembly proved anything, it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t really have a foreign policy.</p> \n   <p>Trump lashed out at China and critics of his climate-change-denying environmental record, celebrated sparse diplomatic achievements and lied about the US fight against the pandemic. His speech encapsulated how he wields power abroad \u2014 in service of domestic and personal political goals, rather than based on a traditional calculation of wider US interests.</p> \n   <p>All Trump\u2019s foreign moves are expected to pull their political weight at home. When he wanted a trade deal with Beijing, Trump was Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s best friend \u2014 offering unwarranted praise over his pandemic leadership. But when his own disastrous handling of the virus threatened hopes of a second term, he chose China as a scapegoat even at the expense of triggering a new Cold War.

They can expand the electorate by restoring the Voting Rights Act, making voter registration universal, and passing comprehensive immigration reform. They can blunt (if not entirely offset) the GOP\u2019s Senate advantage by granting statehood, and two senators apiece, to Puerto Rico and Washington DC. They can undo the effects of McConnell\u2019s court-packing by expanding the bench \u2013 not just the supreme court, but lower courts as well.</p> \n   <p>What\u2019s notable about all of these positions is that they stop far short of what the constitution allows. They don\u2019t involve granting voting rights to recent immigrants, splitting California into seven states, restricting the supreme court\u2019s right to review most cases, or any other long-shot scheme. In other words, should Democrats ever regain power in Washington, they won\u2019t have to choose between ambition and caution.

Hamilton is the first sports star to take top billing in the list\u2019s 14-year history. He says the award is a \u201cmonumental moment\u201d. \u201cGrowing up in Stevenage, there\u2019s quite a small black community there \u2026 to be acknowledged within the black community \u2026 I\u2019m just so proud.\u201d The seven-strong panel unanimously voted him No 1, not only for his amazing sporting career, but because of his commitment to change.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not enough to be not racist.

You have to be against racism and supporting these movements.\u201d The similarities with other stars such as Raheem Sterling and LeBron James are obvious: like Hamilton, both are at the very top of their game but are more than willing to speak out, whatever the risks.</p> <p>But what distinguishes Hamilton is that in Sterling and James\u2019s sports they do not stand alone. There are a large number of high-profile competitors who support them \u2013 both black and white. It is a point that has not been lost on Hamilton: \u201cLook at the NBA, who have been amazing. I was so, so surprised and impressed with what people have been doing \u2026 what the football organisations have done.\u201d Yet he himself hasn\u2019t enjoyed the luxury of such company.</p> <p>Formula One racing began in 1950. In the intervening years some 750 young men have taken to the track. Hamilton is still the only one of African Caribbean heritage.</p> <p>Since Hamilton made the decision to start using his platform for more than showering the second- and third-placed drivers with champagne, he has been a whirlwind. He has encouraged competitors to back him by taking a knee before each race; convinced his team, Mercedes, to change its cars\u2019 livery from silver to black; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/21/lewis-hamilton-commission-increase-diversity-in-motor-sport-formula-one\">set up a commission</a> to make the sport more diverse at all levels of employment \u2013 all the while showcasing the Black Lives Matter cause with a T-shirt and matching BLM facemask.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"638ecca839ddf02531b9b2b16e5a321d27afc077\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/638ecca839ddf02531b9b2b16e5a321d27afc077/0_0_5333_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protest at oppression ...

Taking a knee, for example? \u201cThere are some drivers who don\u2019t take the knee, and there are athletes out there that don\u2019t. But they stand alongside their teammates still.</p> <p>\u201cThere are some drivers that I\u2019ve worked with who took the knee initially and they\u2019re like [he chuckles, with a mock quizzical look], \u2018How long am I supposed to do this for?\u2019 And it\u2019s an interesting question for them, because it obviously shows a lack of understanding.\u201d</p> <p>So what\u2019s the answer? \u201cIt is very symbolic to continue to utilise that platform and use that message. And it\u2019s important to continue to do it, to keep awareness, because otherwise this thing could die a quiet death and go back to how it was in the past. So I don\u2019t see this changing for some time.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s so huge that Mercedes took the silver away... I\u2019m proud of this team for holding themselves accountable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mercedes has been in Formula One since 1954 and whenever it has raced, its cars have always had silver livery \u2013 the team nickname is the Silver Arrows. At the beginning of this season, however, Mercedes said: \u201cWe have chosen to race in an all-black base livery as a public pledge to improve the diversity of our team \u2013 and a clear statement that we stand against racism and all forms of discrimination.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so huge that Mercedes took the silver away,\u201d says Hamilton, proudly. \u201cAnd again, that was a really \u2026 that was a lot of conversation in the background, creating a dialogue and explaining to them the importance of it. It took a moment.</p> <p>\u201cBut I\u2019m so proud of this team for holding themselves accountable and saying: \u2018We haven\u2019t done enough, but we can do more moving forwards, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cSo when we talk, every week, the HR department explain to me the processes that they\u2019re going through to try to improve their understanding and the recruitment process.

When I asked someone where I could find the young driver I was told: \u201cIt\u2019s easy, Lewis Hamilton\u2019s the only black kid here \u2013 and he\u2019ll be three laps ahead of everyone else.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/16/lewis-hamilton-says-mercedes-deal-will-get-done-but-tempers-knighthood-talk-f1\">Lewis Hamilton says Mercedes deal 'will get done' but calms knighthood talk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All those years ago, it was clear the articulate, well-mannered kid I ended up talking to was going to be something special.

Arguably, Hamilton\u2019s most important initiative has been the Hamilton Commission. Talking about it, he lights up.</p> <p>\u201cMost people assume I\u2019m talking about racing drivers, but there are so many great jobs in my industry: marketing, engineering, accounting, catering.</p> <p>\u201cSo this commission, which I\u2019m really, really proud to be partnering on with the Royal Academy of Engineering, is a research project to identify the barriers for black people who are trying to enter into Stem roles in motorsport. I reached out to all these different, super-important and professional people. Each of them has been chosen for their expertise in their field. And I really, really feel that they\u2019re going to be able to enhance our research. I want to be able to take the findings and come out with some real, tangible results that we can apply to the industry to create opportunity.</p> <p>\u201cI want to look back on Formula One in 10 years\u2019 time and really see change because yes, we have this Black Lives Matter moment and there\u2019s a mic and people are hearing it, but you\u2019ve got to really do the work to activate change.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/16/lewis-hamilton-bravery-aged-10-extraordinary-f1-background\">Lewis Hamilton's bravery stood out at 10 \u2013 what he has done since is extraordinary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 10 years\u2019 time he will have retired, but he has no intention of giving up on his goal to break down Formula One\u2019s institutional inertia when it comes to achieving racial equality.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need to continue to work with these guys in the background.

     "body": "<p>The protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd have spread across the world and as many have said: this is not a moment, it\u2019s a movement. But it is also a moment <em>of </em>movement, as the protests have been accompanied by outbreaks of dancing. A common sight on social media and light news spots are the <a href=\"https://www.kxly.com/i/ga-protesters-dancing-to-the-electric-slide/\">Electric Slide</a> and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1269279880476164097?s=20\">Cupid Shuffle</a>, but you can also see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ben7985T-4s\">Cha-cha Slide</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NekaneHarta/status/1269207331927179265?s=20\">Macarena</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_dance/the-george-floyd-protest-dance-that-went-viral/2020/06/04/e285c85c-a5d1-11ea-b473-04905b1af82b_story.html\">krumping</a> and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YonceVocals/status/1267938925839933440?s=20\">haka</a> dance.</p> <p>Dance and public protest have long gone hand in hand. They have even gifted activists a marvellous, much-used slogan: \u201cIf I can\u2019t dance, it\u2019s not my revolution.\u201d Attributed to the anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman, it in fact <a href=\"https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/goldman/Features/danceswithfeminists.html\">paraphrases the original</a>. Around the personal act of dancing it spins giddy, almost ungraspable ideals: liberation, joy, self-expression.</p> <p>Euphoria is one reason why dancing goes with uprising, but it is not the only one. Look at the clips and you\u2019ll notice that nearly every dance is collective. They bring different people \u2013 black and white, protesters and bystanders, sometimes the police \u2013 into alignment. Everyone moves in sequence, with space in between. These dances are unifying actions, collective actions \u2013 not working towards a goal, but rather bringing people together in a wordless way.</p> <p>Whatever else it may be, dancing is not fighting. It is ordered without being forced, it is peaceful but not passive protest. And finally, these dances \u2013 unlike staged flash mobs or art-activist events \u2013 are unauthorised. They belong to whoever is doing them. They are, very literally, movements of the people.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jBkoEM0SSE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5jBkoEM0SSE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Right now, the people\u2019s movement of choice looks to be the Electric Slide. Why? Like the Cupid Shuffle and Cha-cha Slide, it\u2019s a four-wall line dance with a 90-degree turn between each repeat, so you can keep it going for as long as it takes. The basic sequence \u2013 sidesteps and step-touches \u2013 are simple, though the Cupid Shuffle is even simpler. Once you have the steps, you can style the rest how you like.</p> <p>The dance has a long pedigree, with black roots and widespread branches. The step sequence was first devised by Broadway dancer Ric Silver in 1976 to an upbeat reggae song by Bunny Wailer, Electric Boogie, a hit in Jamaica that went on to become a more mainstream&nbsp;US success for his compatriot Marcia Griffiths, in 1982 and 1989.&nbsp;</p> <p>Interestingly, Silver <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7492263&amp;t=1591841913082&amp;t=1591862373568\">tried very hard to authorise</a> his original 22-step sequence (his birthday being 22 January, he was very attached to the number), but despite takedown notices and copyright claims, it\u2019s an unauthorised 18-step version that took hold. You can see why the people\u2019s version won out. After a regular 16 counts, those extra 2 to swivel are like a cute little touch, sending you a notch round the phrase; add in another 4 and you\u2019ve lost the tickle. </p> <p>In the 1990s, the sequence was styled for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pF9PN8UpqI\">American line-dancing</a> and became a genre staple. It got another big boost through the 1999 black romcom&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w2Anvecs6s\">The Best Man</a>, here danced to Cameo\u2019s 1986 hit single Candy. It&nbsp;has become&nbsp;massively popular at parties and weddings,&nbsp;and is&nbsp;often called the Candy Dance.</p> <p>And that\u2019s the Electric Slide. Rooted in black culture, very widely known, accessible, adaptable, inclusive. Why not <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv2qKpna3lM\">learn it</a>? It could be fun, you can make it funky, but it won\u2019t just be frivolous. </p>"

They deserve our respect and support, not condemnation,\u201d Obama said.</p> \n<p>\u201cOn the other hand, the small minority of folks who\u2019ve resorted to violence in various forms, whether out of genuine anger or mere opportunism, are putting innocent people at risk.\u201d</p> \n<p>Obama emphasized that the protests had to translate into policy that would help to prevent more deaths like Floyd\u2019s.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard some suggest that the recurrent problem of racial bias in our criminal justice system proves that only protests and direct action can bring about change, and that voting and participation in electoral politics is a waste of time,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t disagree more.\u201d</p> \n<p>He continued: \u201c[E]ventually,&nbsp;aspirations have to be translated into specific laws and institutional practices&nbsp;\u2013 and in a democracy, that only happens when we elect government officials who are responsive to our demands.\u201d</p> \n<p>The advice from the two-term Democratic president was barely out in the public domain before news began trickling out about a conference call on Monday morning that the current White House occupant, Donald Trump, had with state governors, in which he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/donald-trump-protests-george-floyd-dominate\">urged them to crack down on unrest</a> and said the escalation of protest was successful when the authorities were weak, adding \u201cand most of you are weak\u201d.</p> \n<p>The president reportedly called on the governors to step up enforcement and told them: \u201cYou have to dominate, if you don\u2019t dominate you\u2019re wasting your time.

Typically, when police officers have killed people in the city of Minneapolis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/minneapolis-police-union-bob-kroll-us\">now-former federation president Bob Kroll</a> would go in front of the media and would essentially hail cops as heroes. He would say that their conduct was justified. And he would engage in the demonization of victims of police violence and police murder. Now Bob Kroll has since retired at the end of January, as a result of a lot of community pressure and pressure from activists. There is a new leader. It\u2019s unclear how they will respond as the trial unfolds. But in the early days after George Floyd was killed, Bob Kroll actually went in front of the media and tried to justify the conduct of those officers and engaged in demonizing George Floyd, talking about his past and things that really were not relevant to what happened on May 25th of 2020 that led to his death.<br></p> \n   <p>Now, conversely, when Mohamed Noor, who was the Black Muslim Somali officer who killed Justine Ruszczyk Damond in July of 2017, the union was pretty silent with regards to supporting him. We didn\u2019t see the press conferences and the justifications for Mohamed Noor\u2019s actions as we had seen in previous cases in which officers were being blamed for killing someone. So there\u2019s a definite double standard at play.

Minneapolis police have a long history of engaging in excessive force, and even being allowed to murder people with impunity. </p> \n  <p>\u201cTheir reputation is very well known, particularly amongst Black people and other people of color within the city of Minneapolis.

The department also saw a \u201cstaggering\u201d number of officers seeking disability payments in the wake of the uprising that gripped the city, <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/staggering-number-of-mpls-cops-are-filing-disability-claims/571809512/?refresh=true\">sparking fears of a staffing shortage</a>.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe chief is under tremendous pressure,\u201d said Laurie Robinson, former assistant US attorney general and the co-chair of Barack Obama\u2019s Taskforce on 21st-Century Policing, created in the wake of the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. \u201cThis may be the hardest police chief job in the country at this point, between the tensions around this trial, pressures from the community dealing with the aftermath of the George Floyd death, the calls for changes in the department and the protection of the community that\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/12/28/homicides-go-unsolved-as-killings-in-mpls-rise\">dealing with rising gun violence and crime</a>.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Some local activists acknowledged the significance of Arradondo\u2019s coming testimony but argued it was only a first step.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that he\u2019s going to testify against [Derek] Chauvin but at the same time we need justice,\u201d said <strong>DJ Hooker</strong>, a 26 year-old local organizer with the <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter movement</a></strong>. \u201cGetting Chauvin convicted, that\u2019s a way to get justice.

The MSR office is located just four blocks from where George Floyd was killed on 38th street and the junction with Chicago Avenue, outside the Cup Foods corner story, in the neighborhood of south Minneapolis.<br></p> \n  <p>The MSR is one of the oldest African-American newspapers in the US, published for the last 85 years, and is covering the murder trial of Derek Chauvin with reporting, analysis and opinion.</p> \n  <p>The striking headline on Moriarty\u2019s April 2 piece, quoted above, was <strong>\u201cChauvin defense falls back on racist stereotypes\u201d</strong>.</p> \n  <p>Moriarty <a href=\"https://spokesman-recorder.com/2021/04/02/defense-falls-back-on-racist-stereotypes/\">writes</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> What is the Chauvin defense theory? From the motions they filed, we knew they were going to argue that George Floyd died of an accidental drug overdose. During the opening, however, they introduced this \u201cunruly mob\u201d idea, that the officers felt so threatened that they were prevented from providing \u201ccare\u201d for Floyd. When this \u201cangry mob\u201d theory suddenly appeared in the defense opening, I hoped that I wasn\u2019t hearing dog whistles. Turns out I was. <br></p> \n   <p>One by one the people who were forced to watch Floyd be killed by the police took the witness stand to tell their stories. Four young women under the age of 18, a Black man, an off-duty firefighter, and an older Black man all described, often through tears, their feelings of powerless, as well as the anguish and guilt with which they continue to live. Each witness courageously testified, and all deserve respect and empathy.</p> \n   <p>Yet, most were questioned by the defense in an oddly hostile way. </p> \n   <p>First, there was <strong>Donald Williams</strong>, whose voice we hear in the videos calling Chauvin a \u201cbum,\u201d while pleading with him to get off Floyd\u2019s neck. At one point during his testimony, Williams dabbed at the tears in his eyes with a tissue when he recounted how completely powerless he felt watching Floyd being murdered before his eyes.</p> \n   <p>The defense cross-examination strategy seemed designed to goad Williams into admitting he was angry. After listing the many names Williams called Chauvin and [fellow officer Tou] Thao, the defense repeatedly challenged Williams to acknowledge his anger.</p> \n   <p>\u201cAngry?\u201d I thought. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t be angry watching the police kill a man before his or her eyes?\u201d But then I heard the whistle and I realized Williams, a Black man, was going to be Exhibit 1 for the defense, an angry Black man threatening the police and preventing them from providing the medical care we have been told they so desperately wanted to provide to Floyd. </p> \n   <p>The last questions asked by the defense of young <strong>Darnella Frazier</strong> during her cross-examination were about her posting the video on Facebook and having it go \u201cviral.\u201d \u201cIt changed your life?\u201d said the defense lawyer. \u201cYes,\u201d she answered. The defense asked no more questions. What were we, and the jury, to make of this? Did it bring this young woman, who talked about her social anxiety, the fame, and attention she was seeking? </p> \n   <p>One of the cardinal rules of cross-examination is never to ask a question to which you do not know the answer. When the state had the opportunity to question her again, the prosecutor asked, \u201cHow did it change your life?\u201d And this is when we heard, for the first time, that when this young Black woman saw George Floyd, she saw her father, her brother and her uncles. Through her tears, she told us that she often stays up at night praying to George Floyd and apologizing that she didn\u2019t do more to help him.</p> \n   <p>Why did the defense lawyer assume that this young Black woman benefitted from filming and posting the murder of a Black man? It was creepily reminiscent of the postcards of lynchings that White people used to send to each other. At minimum, this question, and the assumption behind it, reflect a devaluation of Black life\u2013of a man who was murdered, and a young woman traumatized by being witness to what happened to him. </p> \n   <p><strong>But this case is not about race. That is what the defense lawyer said twice to one of the prospective jurors. I wondered why he thought he could say such a thing because, in my mind, this case is all about race.</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-606b2de28f087a7cbd5207f0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-04-05T15:40:49.645Z\">4.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell just arrived at his destination with his witness, hospital emergency doctor Bradford Wankhede Langenfeld.</p> \n  <p>The doctor first signaled that he heard no feedback from the paramedics who brought George Floyd to the hospital that the man was there because of a drug overdose or heart attack.</p> \n  <p>Langenfeld then went on to describe his attempts to revive Floyd, and his analysis after Floyd had been in cardiac arrest for more than 30 minutes and had been declared dead, was that he didn\u2019t find evidence that would have led him to believe that a heart attack had stopped the heart.</p> \n  <p>He concluded, in essence, that Floyd\u2019s death had come about because of oxygen deficiency.</p> \n  <p>Blackwell asked him for another way to describe death by oxygen deficiency.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAsphyxia,\u201d Langenfeld said.

Despite nationwide protests, police are rarely charged when they kill someone on duty. And even when they are, winning convictions is often difficult.</p> \n   <p>Between 2005 and 2015, more than 1,400 officers were arrested for a violence-related crime committed on duty, according to data tracked by Philip M. Stinson, a criminologist at Bowling Green State University. </p> \n   <p>In 187 of those cases, victims were fatally injured in shootings or from other causes. The officers charged represent a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of police officers working for about 18,000 departments nationwide.</p> \n   <p>Police charged with committing violent crimes while on duty were convicted more than half the time during that period. In the most serious cases \u2014 those involving murder or manslaughter \u2014 the conviction rate was lower, hovering around 50 percent.</p> \n   <p>In comparison, about 6 in 10 people charged with violent crimes were convicted, according to a federal report that examined cases adjudicated in the country\u2019s 75 most populous counties in 2009. </p> \n   <p>The number increased to 70 percent when murder was the most serious charge. Most criminal cases in the United States end in plea bargains, rather than court trials.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThe law favors the police, the law as it exists,\u201d said David Harris, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh and an expert in policing.</p> \n   <p>\u201cMost people, I think, believe that it\u2019s a slam dunk,\u201d Harris said of the case against Chauvin.

Three officers were stripped of their training duties in 2018 \u2013 two for disciplinary reasons and another in 2014 who was deemed a \u201cPoor Instructor.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Kueng and Lane had been working unsupervised for less than a week.

He had <strong>swiftly fired Chauvin</strong> and the three officers who helped him in the arrest of Floyd.</p> \n  <p>We expect that Arradondo will work hard to keep the focus on Chauvin and make efforts to show that the former officer stepped outside his training and police principles when he pinned down Floyd and knelt on his neck, even after the man was unconscious. (Floyd died on 25 May 2020. Chauvin denies murder.)</p> \n  <p>However, it will be difficult for the chief to divorce the department from the officer. <strong>Chauvin had been a police officer in Minneapolis for 19 years and had multiple complaints against him</strong> and evidence that he had used his knee to hold people down before, including by the neck.</p> \n  <p><strong>The Marshall Projec</strong><strong>t</strong> <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/02/05/that-could-have-been-me-the-people-derek-chauvin-choked-before-george-floyd\">has reported that</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> Nearly three years before the Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on George Floyd as he cried that he couldn\u2019t breathe last May, Zoya Code found herself in a similar position: handcuffed facedown on the ground, with Chauvin\u2019s knee on her.<br></p> \n   <p>The officer had answered a call of a domestic dispute at her home, and Code said he forced her down when she tried to pull away.</p> \n   <p>\u201cHe just stayed on my neck,\u201d Code said, ignoring her desperate pleas to get off. Frustrated and upset, she challenged him to press harder. \u201cThen he did. Just to shut me up,\u201d she said.</p> \n   <p>Code\u2019s case was one of six arrests as far back as 2015 that the Minnesota attorney general\u2019s office sought to introduce, arguing that they showed how Chauvin was using excessive force when he restrained people by their necks or by kneeling on top of them \u2013 just as he did in arresting Floyd. Police records show that Chauvin was never formally reprimanded for any of these incidents, even though at least two of those arrested said they had filed formal complaints.</p> \n   <p>Of the six people arrested, two were Black, one was Latino and one was Native American. The race of two others was not included in the arrest reports that reporters examined \u2026</p> \n   <p>\u2026 Chauvin, who was fired, has said through his attorney that his handling of Floyd\u2019s arrest was a reasonable use of authorized force.

Last week was harrowing, with eye-witnesses to Floyd\u2019s death <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/31/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-minneapolis-store-clerk\">recalling their horror</a> and helplessness and continuing trauma at watching Chauvin kneel on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes on the ground, and the playing of multiple bystander videos of the fatal encounter. </p> \n  <p>Chauvin, 45, denies all the charges against him: second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2021/mar/30/george-floyd-opening-statements-begin-in-derek-chauvins-trial-video\">Opening arguments</a> took place last Monday as the trial got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/29/derek-chauvin-murder-trial-george-floyd\">fully under way</a>.</p> \n  <p>Then later in the week, police officers started taking the stand, describing their role in securing the scene after Floyd had been taken away by ambulance, lifeless, and locating witnesses.</p> \n  <p>And the city\u2019s top homicide detective and longest serving current officer , Lieutenant <strong>Richard Zimmerman</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/02/derek-chauvin-murder-trial-george-floyd-knee-neck-deadly-force\">testified</a> that Chauvin\u2019s use of force was \u201cuncalled for\u201d and dangerous. </p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s a <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/03/derek-chauvin-trial-analysis-prosecutors-george-floyd\">recap and analysis</a></strong> of last week\u2019s proceedings or if you\u2019re very short of time, a bullet-point review, <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/03/derek-chauvin-trial-four-key-points-so-far\">here</a></strong>.</p> \n  <p>With Floyd\u2019s killing in particular spurring a huge resurgence in the Black Lives Matter racial justice movement last year and the biggest civil rights uprisings since the 1960s, this trial is in the world\u2019s spotlight and American socio-politics and, especially, race, equity and policing, are in focus.

This is a very rare occurrence indeed, for a serving police chief to testify at a trial of an officer or former officer.</li> \n   <li>Arradondo <strong>fired Chauvin</strong> and the other three officers who were involved in arresting George Floyd on 25 May last year. The other officers will stand trial in August, together, accused of aiding and abetting murder.</li> \n   <li>The trial has heard from bystanders, George Floyd\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/04/george-floyd-girlfriend-opioids-pain-officer-derek-chauvin\">girlfriend</a>, and now is hearing from police. After this we expect medical experts to testify about what exactly caused and contributed to Floyd\u2019s death.</li> \n   <li>Protesters have been outside court every day. Sometimes relatives of Floyd, mostly his brother, <strong>Philonise Floyd</strong>, talk to them upon heading into the court house.</li> \n   <li>The <strong>coronavirus pandemic</strong> has heavily restricted public and media presence in the court room, which is why for the first time in its history, Minnesota is allowing the full televising of this criminal trial.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-04-05T13:59:50.416Z\">at 2.59pm BST</time></p> \n</div>"

This is the link that has continued for black mothers for many generations.\u201d</p> <p>Bronze Woman is one of more than 120 monuments, plaques, murals, statues and artworks in a new pocket-size guidebook, <em>Black London</em>, compiled by Nanton and her co-author Jody Burton, and published on Windrush Day on Tuesday.</p> <p>The oldest entry is Cleopatra\u2019s Needle, an obelisk carved in Egypt more than 3,500 years ago and shipped to London in 1878 to be placed on the Embankment. Among the newest is the giant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a> mural in Woolwich, south-east London, created last year in the aftermath of the murder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\" title=\"\">George Floyd </a>by a Minneapolis police officer.</p> <p>Some relate to famous people and well-known events: a mural of Michelle Obama in Brixton; a plaque to footballer Rio Ferdinand in Peckham; a Windrush memorial in Tottenham; the statue of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/30/southafrica.artnews\" title=\"\">Nelson Mandela in Parliament Square</a>.</p> <p>But many highlight less well-known figures and events in black history. Khadambi Asalache was a civil servant and poet who came from Kenya to London in 1960. Over almost two decades, he transformed the interior of a modest terraced house in Wandsworth into a work of art, with intricate hand-carved fretwork, wall paintings and a collection of unusual objects. It is now a National Trust property.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc51ea29bf576ef0fa9e7539e927cd7819f3a8d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc51ea29bf576ef0fa9e7539e927cd7819f3a8d8/0_200_6569_3942/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The bronze woman in Stockwell, London, depicts a woman of African descent\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bronze Woman in Stockwell, London, depicting a woman of African descent, was erected in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Hornsey, north London, there is a plaque to Emma Clarke, a female footballer described in a 19th-century newspaper as \u201cthe fleet footed dark girl on the right wing\u201d. In 1897, Clarke played in a team called \u201cThe New Woman and Ten of Her Lady Friends\u201d against a male team known as \u201cThe Eleven Gentlemen\u201d. The women won 3-1.</p> <p>A plaque at Euston station commemorates Asquith Xavier, who arrived in the UK as part of the postwar Windrush generation to work as a station porter. In 1966, he applied to be a train guard at Euston but was told in a rejection letter that the station did not employ \u201ccoloured\u201d men. He successfully challenged the policy, taking his case to Barbara Castle, then Labour\u2019s transport minister. More than half a century later, Network Rail paid tribute to the \u201cfirst black worker employed as a train guard\u201d in the UK.</p> <p>A 16th-century artwork, the Westminster Tournament Roll, depicts John Blanke, a \u201cblacke trumpeter\u201d at the courts of Henry VII and Henry VIII. The roll was commissioned by Henry VIII to commemorate a two-day tournament to celebrate the birth of his short-lived son with Catherine of Aragon. The work \u2013 the earliest identifiable representation of a black person in British history \u2013 is held at the College of Arms and is too fragile to be viewed, but a plaque to Blanke at the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich was unveiled in 2017.</p> <p>Many of the sites in the book featured in walking tours conducted by Nanton, who retrained as a guide after being made redundant as a facilities manager. Nanton, who came to London from Dominica in 1965, also teaches black history courses with the historian and author Robin Walker. Since Floyd\u2019s murder, she has been inundated with non-black people wanting to attend her online walks, talks and courses, \u201ceager to learn\u201d.</p> <p>The interest sparked by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement was an opportunity to educate the public about the long history of black people in the UK, and help them discover and celebrate individuals and stories missing from mainstream guides and history books, she said.</p> <p>Co-author Burton, who worked in adult education before switching to a career in libraries, said the aim of the guide was to stir interest, start conversations and make black history easily accessible. She hoped it would appeal to parents looking for activities they could do with children.</p> <p>The book contains maps, photographs and a timeline of black history, which went through a painful edit to bring it down from about 75 pages to 11. It also includes a potted history of the HMT Empire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\" title=\"\">Windrush</a>, from its early incarnation as a German cruise ship to its sinking while sailing from Hong Kong to Britain in 1954.</p> <p>One of Burton\u2019s favourite sites \u2013 \u201calthough it\u2019s like trying to choose a favourite child\u201d \u2013 is the battle of Lewisham mural in south London, which commemorates a community anti-racist protest against a National Front march in the area in August 1977 that resulted in clashes.</p> <p>\u201cMy mother attended the counter-demonstration at Ladywell Fields \u2013 and unknown to her, two of my older sisters also joined the protesters,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the first time the NF was prevented from reaching their destination. I took part in one of the community art workshops that helped create the mural.

He is described as \u201cthe first black worker employed as a train guard\u201d there. It was further amended on 24 June 2021 because an earlier version referred to Bronze Woman being, in 2008, the first public statue of a black woman on permanent display in England.

     "standfirst": "<p>An American death has sparked global protest and confronted other countries with uncomfortable truths</p>",
     "body": "<p>George Floyd\u2019s name is now known around the globe; his death has sparked protests from Berlin to Mexico City. The extraordinary cruelty of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\" title=\"\">his killing</a> has shocked the world. But his death has resonated so widely not because it was exceptional, but because it was not. Not exceptional in the US, where the toll of African Americans who have died at police hands is long and shameful. And not, unfortunately, exceptional elsewhere.</p> <p>Tens of thousands gathered at the weekend in London, Manchester, Cardiff, Glasgow and other parts of the UK. In Bristol, protesters toppled a statue of slave trader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/27/bristol-city-slave-trader-edward-colston\" title=\"\">Edward Colston</a>. But the movement has also brought people on to the streets in Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires; in Abuja and Nairobi; in Barcelona, Copenhagen and Paris. These marches express solidarity and outrage that the richest and most powerful country in the world should continue to treat its people this way. Demonstrators oppose the racial legacy it embodies, and the brutal, militarised police response to protests.</p> <p>But though they honour the African American experience, they also recognise the commonality of black struggles elsewhere, and more broadly the fight for human rights. The words \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d are chillingly familiar. In Australia, they evoke the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/family-of-david-dungay-who-died-in-custody-express-solidarity-with-family-of-george-floyd\" title=\"\">David Dungay</a>, an Indigenous man who uttered those words 12 times as he was restrained by prison guards. In Britain, they were cried out by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/26/deportation-escorts-training-safter-restraint-methods-jimmy-mubenga\" title=\"\">Jimmy Mubenga</a> as security guards pinned the deportee to his plane seat.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK is not innocent,\u201d read one placard at a London protest, invoking both its present and past. Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/11/lets-end-delusion-britain-abolished-slavery\" title=\"\">prefers to remember</a> its abolition of the slave trade to its role in industrialising slavery. It finished paying the bill for reparations to slave owners only five years ago. Many people still see empire as a conduit for the spread of cricket and railways. A broader curriculum, which is surely needed, would reveal it as a system of exploitation and white supremacy, with repercussions felt to this day.</p> <p>BAME people <a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/bame-deaths-in-police-custody\" title=\"\">die disproportionately</a> as a result of the use of force or restraint by police, but not one officer has been convicted of manslaughter or murder in decades. Protesters in the UK have highlighted the shooting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/mark-duggan\" title=\"\">Mark Duggan</a>, the Metropolitan police\u2019s growing use of stop-and-search, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\" title=\"\">Windrush scandal</a>, the disproportionate exclusion of black boys from schools and the failure to act on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/08/the-guardian-view-on-race-and-criminal-justice-inequality-is-unfair-to-all\" title=\"\">Lammy report</a>, which highlighted glaring disparities in the criminal justice system. But they have also raised the impact of austerity, the Grenfell fire and the fact that BAME people are so much more likely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\" title=\"\">to die of Covid-19</a>. Racism is structural, and state neglect can be as deadly as state abuse. It does not always take a knee on the neck to kill someone. Poverty, overcrowding, and unequal access to healthcare can be fatal.</p> <p>It is the increased threat from coronavirus which has driven many to the streets. Though protesters have largely been assiduous in their use of face masks and hand gel, there is a real danger that these gatherings will spread infection. Subsequent self-isolation by participants would help to reduce the risks. But when Dominic Cummings got a free pass for his drive to Durham, the leader of the house has forced MPs to return to a crowded chamber, and the government is ignoring warnings that lockdown is being relaxed too quickly, they must not be scapegoated for any rise in infections. Already, black people in London are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/03/met-police-twice-as-likely-to-fine-black-people-over-lockdown-breaches-research\" title=\"\">twice as likely to be fined</a> for breaching coronavirus regulations as white people.</p> <p>To say that black lives matter is not only to demand that they are not stolen, but to insist that they are truly valued. No one expects this to be realised overnight; but nor are they willing to wait. The breadth of the protests is testament to what has gone wrong, but also a promise that change is possible. The protests are black-led but multiracial, showing the growing breadth of support. As in the US, white people are seeking to be allies. Other people of colour are identifying with black experience, while recognising that they too may benefit from racial hierarchies, and may themselves discriminate. Mistakes will be made. But progress can and must be made, too.</p>"

     "body": "<p>The past few months have sparked conversations about defunding the police, specifically through the Black Lives Matter protests held around the world. I want to explain, from a criminological point of view, why this is imperative. </p> <p>We know that there have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/03/without-accountability-there-is-no-justice-for-my-mothers-death-in-australian-police-custody\">more than 440 Aboriginal deaths</a> in custody, according to Guardian Australia, since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody report and recommendations were released in 1991. We know that Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people make up approximately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/29/we-need-to-go-beyond-empty-gestures-if-were-going-to-end-aboriginal-deaths-in-custody\">28% of the total prison population</a> in Australian prisons, despite making up only 2% of the total adult population in Australia.</p> <p>We know and have witnessed police brutality, we have seen the lack of police discretion when it comes to Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people in the community. We know that police surveillance on our young people is occurring through \u201ctaskforces\u201d \u2013 particularly in New South Wales. This includes children as young as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/14/nsw-police-put-children-as-young-as-nine-many-of-them-indigenous-under-surveillance?CMP\">nine years of age</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/03/without-accountability-there-is-no-justice-for-my-mothers-death-in-australian-police-custody\">Without accountability there is no justice for my mother's death in Australian police custody | Apryl Day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We know that deaths in custody would not occur if racist legislation was overturned, specifically in relation to the summary offence of public drunkenness. Victoria is still yet to <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-22/victoria-to-decriminalise-public-drunkenness-tanya-day-inquest/11438836\">decriminalise public drunkenness</a>, despite the commitment to do so in August, 2019.</p> <p>Defunding the police, prison abolition and dismantling the systems that created and continue the ongoing oppression, violence, discrimination and the \u201cothering\u201d of this country\u2019s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, is not a radical idea.</p> <p>I was recently interviewed on <a href=\"http://cdn1.cyberears.com/34146.mp3\">Progressive Podcasts</a> about prison abolition and defunding the police. The main points of this podcast are to look beyond punishment as a way to address crime. It is, after all, a social problem. I am certainly not denying there are people who need to be protected in society and vice-versa. However, in 2016, we knew that <a href=\"https://ipa.org.au/publications-ipa/research-papers/the-use-of-prisons-in-australia-reform-directions\">approximately 46% of people</a> in Australians prisons were incarcerated for non-violent offences. The cost of incarceration of people in prisons for non-violent offences equates up to $1.8bn nationwide.</p> <p>We need to be looking at redirecting those funds to services that adequately and appropriately address the social issues around non-violent offences. Prison abolition is not about simply opening the prisons up and letting dangerous people into the community. It is about supporting the services that are integral to society. This includes housing, health, education and employment. These areas have all been defunded, yet this is not seen as radical \u2013 it is almost expected and accepted.</p> <p>Police brutality is another reason why we should be looking to defund the police. Korey Penny, an Aboriginal man, <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/aboriginal-man-accuses-police-of-violent-assault-and-racist-abuse-20200904-p55si9.html\">said he was violently thrown off his bicycle by police officers in Melbourne recently and called a \u201cblack cunt\u201d</a>. An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/02/video-shows-nsw-australia-police-officer-slamming-indigenous-boy-face-first-onto-pavement\">Aboriginal teenager in New South Wales</a> was kicked to the ground by police officers in an incident caught on camera. Video footage also showed an Aboriginal man being arrested and hit by police in Adelaide, in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-53062488\">June 2020</a>. In Sydney, Aboriginal man <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-06-23/footage-shows-man-tasered-by-police-in-sydneys-eastern-suburbs/12383138\">Kris Bradshaw was tasered in the face</a> and was thrown to the ground in June 2020. These examples have occurred over the past few months, but police brutality is a practice that has <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/enforcing-assimilation-dismantling-aboriginal-families-a-history-of-police-violence-in-australia-140637\">occured since colonisation</a>. </p> <p>We have seen time and time again that police are not held accountable for their excessive use of force and violence towards people in society. </p> <p>What is radical is living in a society where acts of violence are accepted because a blue uniform is worn or where racist legislation exists.</p> <p>It is not so radical to say we need to defund police and pour much needed funds and resources into areas that improve social issues such as housing, health, education and employment. These, in turn, reduce the incarceration rates of Aboriginal people and reduces the over-reliance of degrading and dehumanising punitive measures such as prisons. It also addresses the social issues that impact on the disproportionate numbers of Aboriginal people in prison. We need to be exploring alternatives to prison and stop violence in the community. We must address the issues at the beginning, not looking for services to respond and \u2018fix\u2019 issues created by the criminal justice system. <br></p> <ul> <li><p>Robyn Oxley is a Tharawal woman and has family connections to Yorta Yorta.

He has documented civil unrest in the Middle East, Ukraine and Iraq, where he learned a few things: never get in the police\u2019s way, find cover, stick together, always know your exit and make sure you are clearly identifiable as press. So when the curfew hit and police fired teargas into the crowd of protesters, Ou stood steady, out of the way, documenting.

Since then, the president has called protesters thugs, terrorists and hoodlums. He has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/politics/military-national-guard-trump-protests.html\">deployed the national guard</a>, berated governors for being weak while urging them to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/donald-trump-protests-george-floyd-dominate\">\u201cdominate\u201d protesters</a> and suggested 10-year prison sentences for them. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I think the police see journalists as attacking their tribe \u2013 they feel they are getting a lot of bad press because of what happened to Floyd</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Barbara Davidson</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>And at several points, he has made clear that the press is to be viewed as part of the problem. Trump has directly accused journalists of being complicit in the destruction taking place during the protests, suggesting they were in cahoots with looters. \u201cIf you watch Fake News CNN or MSNDC [sic], you would think that killers, terrorists, arsonists \u2026 would be the nicest, kindest most wonderful people in the world,\u201d he said in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1268166288993632256\">one tweet</a>.

After a confrontation with a police officer telling her to move out of the way, she did \u2013 then, he came at her from behind and pushed her. She fell to the ground and whacked her head on the curb. As her neck whipped back and she tried to get up, she felt grateful: she had come to the protest wearing protective headgear and goggles.</p> \n<p>That cop may have been a bad egg \u2013 just as there are looters among the mostly peaceful protesters so too there will be rogue cops who use and abuse their power, she says. But when she is out working, Davidson is not worried about the looters, she is worried about police.</p> \n<p>Now, the worst part of Davidson\u2019s day while out covering the protests is finding her car. She runs through highly policed neighborhoods with her head down, waving her press pass and shouting to identify herself.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat is something you do in war zones \u2013 it is such a mindfuck. I am in the streets of Los Angeles,\u201d she says.</p> \n<h2>\u2018The police understand the power of visuals right now\u2019</h2> \n<p>Davidson is not the only one arguing that covering those protests, on American soil, has thrown reporters in extremely dangerous circumstances.</p> \n<p>When Christopher Mathias was pushed by a cop in New York while covering the protests on Saturday, he made the mistake of telling the officer to fuck off. Within seconds, cops had their legs on Mathias\u2019s head; twisting his arm and putting pressure on him until he thought his arm might break.</p> \n<p>Mathias has covered far-right rallies, the Baltimore uprisings and the first Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson in 2014, and he calls the current protests some of the most intense he has seen. In part, he puts that down to the nature of the protests.</p> \n<p>In Charlottesville, Virginia, he watched as armed, white far-right protesters pushed back the police with little resistance. In Georgia, he watched as militarized officers policing a neo-Nazi rally <a href=\"https://twitter.com/letsgomathias/status/987755595238428673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E987755595238428673&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantavoice.com%2Farticles%2Fmilitarized-cops-at-georgia-neo-nazi-rally-arrest-counter-protesters-for-wearing-masks%2F\">targeted anti-racist protesters</a>, threatening them with semi-automatic rifles while white supremacists were left alone.&nbsp;</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>You have that badge around your neck, and more often than not it\u2019s going to protect you rather than harm you</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Christopher Mathias</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThere are a lot of Trump supporters in police departments,\u201d says Mathias. He points out the speech made by Trump in Long Island in 2017, when <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/28/16059536/trump-cops-speech-gang-violence-long-island\">a crowd of officers clapped</a> as he encouraged them to rough people up.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are in this fascist moment and it stands to reason that the [police] probably don\u2019t like the press and think that being law enforcement gives them the right to rough up whomever they please,\u201d says Mathias. In other words, while not all officers act this way, now is an opportune moment to hide in plain sight.</p> \n<p>Mathias thinks the police probably dealt with him so heavy-handedly because he was disrespectful to them, not because he is a journalist. For him, that\u2019s a reminder of what can happen to any person at a protest in the current climate.</p> \n<p>\u201cJournalists have privileges that a lot of people don\u2019t. You have that badge around your neck, and more often than not it\u2019s going to protect you rather than harm you. A lot of cops at least have an understanding that if they mess up a journalist it could backfire,\u201d says Mathias.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PLBarghouty/status/1266922618122354690\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NYPD violently arresting protestors, journalists.

After all, it\u2019s a story that is still unfolding, with his ex-girlfriend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ghislaine-maxwell\">Ghislaine Maxwell </a>recently taken into custody. But there\u2019s power in being the first, and Lisa Bryant\u2019s project \u2013 which entered production, securely under wraps, while Epstein was still alive \u2013 valuably amplifies the voices of victims who were unheard for too long.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"874f111a-cad3-4c0d-a12f-5c03714280d6\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>After 25 years as a showrunner and producer, Lisa Bryant\u2019s first documentary series as a director was<em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2020/may/27/jeffrey-epstein-netflix-documentary\">Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich</a></em><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2020/may/27/jeffrey-epstein-netflix-documentary\">,</a>&nbsp;which premiered on Netflix in May. Originally based on James Patterson\u2019s 2016 book of the same name, the four-parter developed the story of Epstein\u2019s life, his court cases, and his death.</p>\n    <p><b>Why did you decide to make&nbsp;<em>Filthy Rich?</em></b><br>To show how our justice system was broken, expose Epstein\u2019s abuse of wealth and power, and most importantly, to give the survivors a platform to get their voices heard.</p>\n    <p><b>When did you start working on&nbsp;it?</b><br>Long before Epstein was arrested and dead, when he was still powerful, wealthy and intimidating, in November 2018.</p>\n    <p><b>What problems did you have getting it made?</b><br>We had to get a private room locked in our production offices for interviews, and encrypted communications to make sure no one hacked in. We had to protect everything we had, then the story started changing overnight.</p>\n    <p><b>And it\u2019s still changing. How did you react to Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s arrest?<br></b>I hope our documentary played some part in putting pressure on the FBI to act quickly. Ghislaine will be the first of many arrests.</p>\n    <p><b>Do you think&nbsp;<a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/uk/prince-andrew\">Prince Andrew</a>&nbsp;will speak?<br></b>It\u2019s interesting that the US is saying \u201cWe\u2019re asking him for answers\u201d, and he\u2019s saying \u201cI\u2019m offering them up, but no one wants them\u201d. I hope for the women\u2019s sakes he does offer answers. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll ever fully come clean, but I think the survivors would still respect him if he spoke to the FBI.</p>\n    <p><b>What can\u2019t you live without while you\u2019re working?<br></b>Good co-workers, and two cups of coffee before 10am, or else I get a headache!</p>\n    <p><b>How would you sell documentary films to someone who says they\u2019re not into factual films?</b><br>I\u2019d tell them documentaries use lots of techniques from other films, so are more intriguing and entertaining than one would think.</p>\n    <p><b>What has stayed with you since you finished<em>&nbsp;Filthy Rich</em>?</b><br>Survivors saying how being involved has changed their lives for the better. It\u2019s especially gratifying when it\u2019s people that hadn\u2019t spoken before.

Then the headlines vanished. There was this total political silence around the crimes of Ramzan Kadyrov [head of the Chechen Republic] that seemed so harrowing and unheard of in modern times. I felt an obligation to tell the story in a way that put pressure on politicians to do something, in some small way to contribute to bringing justice to the victims there.</p>\n    <p><b>How did you protect their identities?</b><br>I promised to disguise them. I began to research possible technologies were, but I found the [digital] tools other film-makers had used did not allow me to capture the kind of humanity that I witnessed. So we recruited people, mostly from New York, and mostly LGBTQ activists, to lend their faces as a human shield. We mapped them pixel by pixel over the faces of the people who were in the film. It restores a truth, and it does it in a way that empowers but also protects.</p>\n    <p><b>What&nbsp;can documentary film-making&nbsp;do that journalism can\u2019t?</b><br>It can reflect not just fact but emotion, in a way that is really unmatched by any other kind of nonfiction storytelling.</p>\n    <p><b>Do you consider yourself first a journalist, film-maker or activist?</b><br>Journalist first.

Costa is currently working on&nbsp;<em>Dystopia</em>, about the Covid-19 outbreak in Brazil.</p>\n    <p><b>When did you decide to make&nbsp;<em>The Edge&nbsp;</em><em>of Democracy</em>?</b><br>Filming a protest in March 2016, calling for the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff [the leftwing president]. I\u2019d been working in France for a few years, and when I came back, there was this mounting hatred towards the left, which I couldn\u2019t understand. Here, I suddenly had the uncanny sensation of being in a fascist protest. A boy was harassed just because he was in red, the colour of the workers\u2019 party. People were applauding police taking him to prison. Immediately I felt I had to dive into this cancer to understand where it was coming from, and where it was headed.</p>\n    <p><b>Was the film a story for&nbsp;Brazil, or for an international audience?</b><br>Reading British people\u2019s accounts of their psychological state after Brexit \u2013 a few months after the protest I filmed \u2013 was when I finally understood what I was feeling. People of my generation feel groundless. The same happened after the election of Donald Trump. My film is about the relationship of an individual to his or her democracy, and the trauma of losing that.</p>\n    <p><b>The film ends with <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/2019/jan/01/jair-bolsonaro-inauguration-progressive-brazil-rainforest-protections-police\">Jair&nbsp;Bolsonaro\u2019s&nbsp;inauguration</a>&nbsp;as president on 1 January 2019. How is it looking back at that now?</b><br>He\u2019s fulfilling his promises. <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/democraciaabierta/brasil-al-borde-de-una-dictadura-en/\">In 1999, he&nbsp;said</a>&nbsp;once he got power he would deliver a coup, dissolve congress, and do what the military coup didn\u2019t and kill 30,000. That is happening with Covid-19, except that 80,000 are dead. The countries hit most hard by the virus have leaders that have a lack of consideration for human life. That\u2019s what fascism is. That\u2019s why I\u2019m making&nbsp;<em>Dystopia</em>.</p>\n    <p><b>How are you making it?</b><br>We\u2019ve had people sending us footage from across Brazil, shot on their phones.</p>\n    <p><b>What was the best reaction to your film?<br></b>Young people saying they hadn\u2019t spoken to their best friend for years, but after watching it, they could connect again.

A replacement name will be brought in some time after.</p> <p>Early Aunt Jemima logos featured various crude renderings of a dark-skinned woman wearing a headscarf, the design clearly influenced by minstrel shows, where white-skinned actors would portray stereotyped black people.</p> <p>Later Aunt Jemima was portrayed by real women \u2013 first Nancy Green, who had been born enslaved, and then Anna S Harrington.</p> <p>In 1989 Quaker updated Aunt Jemima, removing the woman in a head scarf and introducing the character which still appears on packaging today. <a href=\"https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1989-05-29-8901280016-story.html\">At the time a company spokesman said</a> they \u201cwanted a more modern-looking woman, but one who still has traditional values\u201d, who could retain the \u201cgoodwill and positive perceptions that already existed\u201d.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/mammies/\">the Jim Crow museum of racist memorabilia</a>, Aunt Jemima is \u201cthe most well known and enduring racial caricature of African American women\u201d and is based on the \u201cmammy\u201d stereotype.</p> <p>\u201cFrom slavery through the Jim Crow era, the mammy image served the political, social, and economic interests of mainstream white America.</p> <p>\u201cDuring slavery, the mammy caricature was posited as proof that blacks \u2013 in this case, black women \u2013 were contented, even happy, as slaves. Her wide grin, hearty laughter and loyal servitude were offered as evidence of the supposed humanity of the institution of slavery.\u201d</p> <p>A pair of businessmen in Missouri created Aunt Jemima\u2019s pancake mix in the late 1880s. They took the name Aunt Jemima from a popular vaudeville song, according to the Jim Crow museum.</p> <p>In 2014 two descendants of Harrington, whose likeness was used for Aunt Jemima, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/10/06/aunt-jemima-lawsuit/16799923/\">sued the brand</a>, claiming they were owed royalties. The case was dismissed in 2015, after Quaker said Aunt Jemima was never meant to be a real person.</p> <p>\u201cThe image symbolizes a sense of caring, warmth, hospitality and comfort and is neither based on, nor meant to depict any one person,\u201d Quaker Oats said at the time.</p>"

We already know that <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/work-pay-and-benefits/unemployment-and-economic-inactivity/unemployment/latest#by-ethnicity\">9% of black people</a> are unemployed, compared with <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/work-pay-and-benefits/unemployment-and-economic-inactivity/unemployment/latest\">4% across all ethnic groups</a>. There is still a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-48121840\">13% attainment gap</a> between black and white students at university. You are <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/crime-justice-and-the-law/policing/stop-and-search/latest\">nine times more likely</a> to be stopped and searched if you are black than if you are white. Out of every 100 professors, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/sep/07/uk-university-professors-black-minority-ethnic\">only two</a> are ethnic minority women. It is still the case that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/29/more-than-half-young-people-jail-are-of-bme-background\">51% of children locked</a> up in prison are from ethnic minorities, even though black, Asian and minority-ethnic people make up 14% of the UK\u2019s total population.</p> <p>Yes, there has been huge progress on racial equality in the past century. Nothing gives me more hope than this. But, with these statistics, should we give up wanting more? </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>On justice, on Home Office failures, on deaths in custody and on inequalities in the workplace, we already have the data</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We do not need another review, or report, or commission to tell us what to do. I personally made <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/lammy-review-final-report\">35 recommendations</a> in the Lammy report on inequality in the criminal justice system. There are 110 specific recommendations in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/04/families-of-people-who-died-in-police-custody-failed-by-system-report\">Angiolini review</a> about disproportionality in deaths in custody. There are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/windrush-report-what-the-home-office-needs-to-act-on\">30 recommendations</a> in Wendy Williams\u2019s review about the Home Office\u2019s failure in the Windrush scandal. There are 26 specific recommendations in Ruby McGregor-Smith\u2019s review about <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/594336/race-in-workplace-mcgregor-smith-review.pdf\">discrimination in the workplace</a>.</p> <p>If Boris Johnson is serious about responding to the Black Lives Matter movement that has inspired people from all races and all backgrounds, he does not need to announce another commission on the back of a fag packet. Yet that\u2019s what he did, as an aside in his Daily Telegraph <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-protests-britain-s/uk-pm-johnson-defends-churchill-criticises-distortion-of-our-history-telegraph-idUSKBN23L0Z7\">column</a> today about the Winston Churchill statue.</p> <p>We do not need a repeat of Theresa May\u2019s 2017 race audit. It is time for action on the countless reviews, reports and commissions on race that have already been completed.</p> <p>There are real examples of leadership on race that the government can look to. The prime minister would do well to learn from Roy Jenkins, who in 1976 introduced the <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/private-lives/relationships/collections1/race-relations-act-1965/race-relations-act-1965/\">Race Relations Act</a>. Or perhaps he could take inspiration from another Johnson, Lyndon B \u2013 who, after forming a relationship with Martin Luther King, signed the 1964 act that dismantled official segregation, the 1965 act that prohibited racist voting laws, and the 1968 act that outlawed discrimination in the housing market. This is what leadership looks like.</p> <p>Of course, there is a time and a place for new reviews, for gathering new data and for making recommendations. This is most important when challenges are not well understood. This why the government was right to announce a review into the disproportionate effect of Covid-19 on black and other ethnic minority people, but so wrong to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/14/racism-disproportionate-uk-bame-coronavirus-deaths-report\">bury the recommendations</a> it made.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/15/boris-johnson-racism-inquiry-plan-written-on-back-of-fag-packet-says-lammy\">Johnson's racism inquiry plan 'written on back of fag packet', says Lammy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labour has had to step in to fill this void. As a matter of urgency, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has tasked social justice campaigner Doreen Lawrence, working closely with the shadow equalities secretary, Marsha de Cordova, with leading a review that makes recommendations to prevent disproportionality and keep black and minority communities safe throughout the rest of this pandemic.</p> <p>But on justice, on Home Office failures, on deaths in custody, on disproportionality on corporate boards, and on inequalities in the workplace, we already have the data and the recommendations that we need.</p> <p>Johnson needs to stop the dither and delay. Black lives matter. The country is crying out for action.</p> <p>\u2022 David Lammy is the Labour MP for Tottenham and shadow lord chancellor and shadow justice secretary</p>"
